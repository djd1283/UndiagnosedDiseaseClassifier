Female, age 1 with brain abnormalities (agenesis of the corpus callosum and arachnoid cyst) and chronic diarrhea caused by a change in the ARX gene (with severity impacted by her diagnosis of mosaic Turner syndrome)
Female, age 3 with limited joint movement (arthrogryposis) and low muscle tone (hypotonia)
