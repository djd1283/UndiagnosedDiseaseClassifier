Inventory Wiped - Can't Interact w/ anything in the world	Everything has been fine in the last week of playing until the last 30 minutes. First of all Realms started lagging (Happens a few times a day yet isn't my internet) and I decided to relog to see if it was my Internet. After doing various speed tests it wasn't an issue on my side. The lag continued so I closed and reopened the realm. I can currently load in after an extreme delay on chunk generation yet my inventory is cleared and I can not open any item such as my chests, brewing stands and furnaces. This is honestly frustrating but what is the actual problem? I'm super close to just cancelling my realms subscription because this has honestly frustrated me.	realms
Help with Archer C7 AC1750 router	"All, My trusty Archer C7 is dropping the 2.4GHz band about once a day for seemingly no reason. Devices will still be able to connect to it, but they all show, ""connected, no internet."" Turning it off and back on works, and I just leave the modem running (comcast, it's my own modem, an old surfboard 8x4 that I'll need to upgrade soon). Should I reset to factory settings then make sure it's on the most recent firmware, and if that doesn't work, buy a new router? Never had to troubleshoot one of these before. If I were to upgrade, what would y'all recommend? The Archer A7, or something else? And a random bonus question, if I wanted to put a router in a shed at the corner of my property, could I just run a 200 ft cat5e cable to it, and set up the router as an access point, or is there a better way to do that? (shed has its own circuit breaker panel if that matters)."	HomeNetworking
Problem setting up Pro controller with BetterJoy	"Hey all, I have been trying to set up my switch pro controller using BetterJoyforcemu. Ultimately I'm going to be using the controller for PJ64 but I wasn't able to get any help from the JP64 sub. I definitely plan to use Cemu in the future if I can get my controller working! I can connect the controller via Bluetooth, I can ""locate"" the controller in BetterJoy and get vibration feedback, and the home button is lit up blue (I can hit the home button to open up the game menu and within this menu I can use the controller joystick). But when I click on ""Map Buttons"" within BetterJoy, it only shows options for capture, home, SL/SR for left and right joycons, and a greyed out Re-center Gyro button. I've downloaded and installed all the drivers according to the instructions, and I'm not sure what else I can try. The system I'm using is a pretty basic up-to-date Lenovo laptop running Windows 10, 4GB RAM, CPU @2.7GHz. Any ideas?"	cemu
Does anyone know of a place taking back empties?	It's getting a bit ridiculous at this point that grocery stores and deps are still not taking back consignes/deposits on beer bottles and cans. The Ontario beer store has re-started accepting empties but everywhere I go here in Montreal, it seems like there is always a sign saying consigne non-accepte. Anyone know of a place accepting returns?	montreal
Looking for guild	Hi guys, Like the titles says, I'm looking for a guild (semi hardcore raiding but also casual). I have a lvl 60 undead warlock almost full bis and started raiding. So far I just have experienced ZG and Mc. All my guilds so far having been raiding around 18.30/19.00. For me that's way to early and I always lose my spots or miss most parts of the raid wich means also loot. So I'm looking for a guild who is raiding a Lil later like 20.30 or 21.00 if that even exist. Because I have kids it's not possible for me to get online earlier, that's why I'm mostly late. I guess the fathers can relate to that dilemma :p Atm I'm a warlock horde side on zandalar tribe eu but I'm willing to Transfer to another realm if u guys want me :) If u are already on zandalar tribe that's even beter. Hope to hear from you guys soon üòÅ	classicwow
Do you think alcohol wholesalers should be allowed to sell to the public?

Does saying pet names like ‚Äúmy sweetheart‚Äù in good morning texts mean he‚Äôs into me?	"I've been talking to/dating this guy for a few months. We haven't been able to hang out much because of quarantine but he texts me every day and in the morning they usually are something along the lines of ""good morning beautiful/cutie/sweetie."" This morning he said ""good morning my sweetheart."" Do you think these are just nice statements to keep me interested and are things that he says to anyone or do you think it actually shows more interest than that? Saying ""my sweetheart"" sounds more intentional and serious than the other sayings. I know I could just ask him what we are and if he's interested in more but I just thought I'd get all of your opinions!"	relationship_advice
Do you calorie count while doing IF?	Hi, I'm really new to IF and I just have a question. Do most people calorie count as well as doing IF? I used a calculator to find out I should only be eating 1200 calories a day if I want to lose weight but I feel so hungry when I'm doing that with IF. I do 16/8 and eat from 11-7pm. I'm not sure if it's common to do both and if you do do both, how are you satisfied? I'm sorry if my questions seem awkward, I'm really interested in the community! I just want some help/advice.

Would you want private lobby warzone missions?	By this I mean, say you only have 1 buddy to play with and you don‚Äôt want to be put in a warzone with 2 other random people. You would go into a private warzone mission instead of a public one, and that would put you in a warzone with just you and you‚Äôre buddy, nobody else. This leads to my next question, would you want the rest of your squad to be AI‚Äôs or just not there at all? Options to fill the squad with AI or not would be awesome because options are always great to have, but if I had to choose I‚Äôd say no AI. I bring this up because I‚Äôd personally love to do co-op warzones, and it‚Äôd be a nice challenge to take on a warzone with only 2 avengers. Using an iconic duo to play with like cap and widow, or Thor and hulk just seems fun and would force a lot more teamwork and synergy between characters that compliment each other‚Äôs skills.

Tips on Recovering from a Binge Sesh & Associated Shame/ Disappointment?	I‚Äôve been great about sticking to calorie limits (1750) for the first time in my life. Made it to about 5 weeks, and posted on r/progresspics (my main motivation), but deleted my post with the progress I was so proud of after receiving too many sexual DMs. Since then, I‚Äôve felt very low energy (‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù), have been oversleeping and had 3 days where I massively oversnacked (with an extra 2000+ calories). Does anyone have tips for renewing hope and motivation? I was so excited to watch the numbers on my scale go down, and now it all feels so out of reach/ pointless when I can wreck it all as easily as running to the store and eating too big a bag of chips. And it sucks to not be able to share my progress. Being sexualized for normal pics of my body just makes me want to hide my body and never show off my progress again.	loseit
Why is there no interest on damage deposits?	I alway thought there would be interested added to damage deposits, since I believed they went into the landlord's bank account for holding until being returned to the tenant. I checked out this handy NS gov [calculator](https://novascotia.ca/sns/access/land/residential-tenancies/security-deposit-interest-calculator.asp#calculator) to find out that there is in fact 0% interest since 2013. Does the money go somewhere else, not to the landlord, when you pay it? I thought we email-transferred ours directly to our landlord a few years ago when we moved in. Looking for some clarification, and hoping to learn something new here :)	halifax

It would be interesting if a feature was added that lets you directly click on Monika, ie when you click on her head it's a headpat, when you click on her cheek it's a kiss, when you click on her bo- you get that point.

Myth: You Can Make A Good Career Out of Field Data Collection	Lots of newcomers and fresh grads have interest in GIS because of the idea of getting out in the field collecting data. Im open to being proven wrong, but as a whole after 10 years in this career and multiple industries, I generally feel that field data collection is always seen as a lower paying or entry level position. I actually know a guy who tried making a career out of data collection but after 15 years of doing it he was so far behind on office skills he couldnt be promoted. Another guy I knew worked as an arborist and the pay was low and he was constantly being bounced around the country every couple of months. Now this isnt to say there are not predominantly office jobs that offer occasional field collection days, but more often than not those collection days are ‚Äúrewards‚Äù for getting all the office work caught up with. If you have a job that is more field than office and you think your salary is competitive, let us know, but I wanted to dispel the myth that most GIS jobs are not field based, and if they are they are considered entry level.	gis

Glorious Freedom	"NOT LOOKING FOR ADVICE OR ANYTHING! JUST SHARING MY STORY! This post is late, but it is still due. On Saturday, my wife and I drove 2.5 hours away to pick up my brand new 2020 Iron 1200 in Barracuda Silver (a must). My brother lived in the city I picked the bike up in and he met me there on his bike (2019 Yamaha Bolt C-Spec). Prior to picking this bike up, I had minimal experience. I completed the Harley MSF course in January and haven't been in the saddle since. That all changed when I picked up this beaut. After a couple of laps around the Harley Dealership, it was time. With an abundance of caution, my brother and I, with my wife and pup following in a car behind us, we were out of the parking lot driving off into the city of wonder. Before I knew it, I was up to 55MPH (speed limit) and the wind was relieving my years of stress. By Saturday evening, the bike was broken in (according to the service manager at Harley, ride 45 minutes shifting through all the gears and all RPM ranges, let cool 20 min, ride 45 min. again, and cool again, this will break a motorcycle in when you live in the mountains). Over the course of the weekend, my brother, who was beyond supportive and provided just enough constructive criticism, had pushed me just out of my comfort zone. We rode down empty streets, busy roadways, highway stretches, mountain curves, and everything in between. I wasn't so far out of my comfort zone as to where an accident was imminent. I was pushed out just enough to where I didn't have a choice but to experience what the world had to offer. He rode at his speed in the twisties, I rode at mine. As any great leader of a group ride would, he waited for me when the time was right. I was never pushed to run faster or to place myself in dangerous situations. Come yesterday around 4 PM, our weekend of riding was concluded, together anyway. When we split ways, he had a 1-hour commute home and I was looking at a daunting 2.5-hour commute home. We exchanged blessings of safe commutes and the normal ""love ya's"" that we do, and off we were to our homes. After the weekend riding with him, I was a lot less intimidated by the long commute home (my wife was also behind me the whole way with the pup watching from the back seat). I quickly realized that due to all the experience I was given over the weekend, this commute was nowhere near as daunting. In fact, it was peaceful and exhilarating at the same time. No jitters, no fear, just fun. By 8 PM last night, the bike was parked and my wife and I were enjoying some rest and relaxation after a long weekend. What a time to be alive. For this weekend, and the days, years, decades to follow, the ride made me forget the current state of affairs, my daily stressors, and anything and everything that didn't pertain to the ride. Alas, I am now part of the family, not just the motorcycle community, but the Harley Davidson community. TL;DR: Bought 2020 Iron 1200 in Barracuda Silver. Brother and I rode all weekend, broke her in, put over 250 miles on her, and made a 2.5-hour commute back to the home city as a 3rd-day rider."	Harley

There is absolutely no reason for this game to be as addictive as it is, and that every player has fallen down the ‚Äúone more day‚Äù hole.

Try not to use technology for the last few hours of your day (if you can).	Most of the time I gave into porn and masturbating was when I was browsing my phone in the late evening. Because I have to spend so much time at home during the current lock down, I stop using technology around 9 pm every day and I usually read until it's bedtime. It's been very helpful and definitely a contributing factor for me getting past the 50 day streak! I think if we want to fight our addictions and get better, we need to be willing to make changes that challenge our comfort zone.	NoFap

I have been promoted to moderator.	"Hello everyone. I apologize in advance if I have been posting too much. I had a nice reflection on Submitters that I wanted to share with everyone, but I am going to hold off on it until tomorrow. I have been selected by the staff as one of the moderators for the subreddit, and I am honored to be a part of the team. Honestly, I don't feel fully up for the challenges, and I don't intend to ""exact justice"" on everything I disagree with, as that is abusive. My primary goals as a moderator is to moderate, like a moderator in a civil debate. I don't tolerate insults between the ummah, and we are not encouraged to act like this directly from the Quran. In order to be a hospitable sub, I ask the community to help me not delete comments, lock threads, or ban members. I'd prefer I'd never have to use these. I prefer to maintain the traditional moderator role by allowing discussions to naturally progress. As always, I do not care if someone is straight, gay, lesbian, Sunni, Shia, Amadhiyya, Ex-Muslim, or any type of Muslim. I do not care if they come from Iran, the United States, or India. I do not care if they took Arabic classes at Al-Azhar or not fluent in Arabic and can't recite Al Fatihah. We have come together in a very distinct time in human history where we now can talk to people openly in a forum where it was impossible to do no less than 30 years ago. Let keep it that way. May God help me make sound decisions to help my brothers and sisters of this subreddit. May God bless you as well."	Quraniyoon

Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2 - Most Essential Everyday Jacket Review (YouTube)	Hi all, Posted this review in the Arc'teryx sub with positive responses, and thought I share in the BIFL sub as it definitely qualifies. When people think of Arc'teryx, they usually associate the brand with Climbing, Skiing, Hiking and maybe even Trail Running or Biking. And those that are very familiar Arc'teryx know that their products are some of the most expensive outdoor apparel but built with high standards of quality and perhaps the best warranty in the business, that makes the product you've invested in truly BI4L. However, what most people do not know that Arc'teryx also sells high quality military spec'd products to Law Enforcement and Armed Forces (LEAF). And one of the most popular jackets from Arc'teryx, the Atom LT, has a LEAF version, the Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Gen 2, which can be used as an everyday BI4L spring/fall and mild winter jacket. Below is a 2 Part comprehensive YouTube Review of the Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2, outlining why it should be considered the best most essential everyday spring/fall jacket. **Part 1** \- Outlines MUST and SHOULD Criteria and Candidates for Comparison [https://youtu.be/MLVf0gC7rAs](https://youtu.be/MLVf0gC7rAs) **Part 2** \- Visual and Hands On Review \- Comparison of Product Feature Differences and Advantages over the civilian Atom LT Hoody \- Hood, Shell, Liner comparisons vs other Arc'teryx jackets \- Fit and Layering Options \- Pros and Cons Summary [https://youtu.be/H8GtwJ2uizs](https://youtu.be/H8GtwJ2uizs) Please forgive the length of each video, as I wanted to be thorough in the comparisons and provide as much detail covering all the key technical aspects and benefits for the everyday user of the LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2, as there are not too many reviews on this jacket. Feel free to comment either here or in the YouTube comments section; and whether there are other jackets that should have been considered based on the criteria or have any questions on the LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2 jacket itself. Cheers!	BuyItForLife

Babies are ugly and a drain on resources and I don't understand why anybody wants them	So a lot of people see babies and think they're cute and they want their own. Where does that come from, where do you get that? I'm usually the only girl at family reunions who refuses to hold the baby. Partially because I'm afraid I'll drop it but more than that I don't want them to cry or shit or throw up on me. That's another thing, everyone things its adorable when babies do gross shit. Plus to have one of those little fuckers you have to keep it inside of you for 9 months. Seemingly 9 months of body ruining, misery, having to avoid things you like, not being able to have fun and at the end of it you have to push a human outside of you. Why do people choose this? And then when the baby is born it costs so much to raise it properly. A permanent financial drain. And after all of that shit what do you get? Another human who has to exist in the real world now. And there's a chance of your kid being handicapped which can change the course of your life into a permanent caretaker. How do people look past all of this and still decide that after everything they want a baby? As far as I know this is very unpopular because roughly 360,000 people are born a day.	unpopularopinion

Did socialite Ann Woodward accidentally shoot and kill her wealthy husband? Or did she murder him and cover it up? Did famed author Truman Capote reveal the truth about the death in his gossipy tell all that blew the doors off high New York society? And why did she take a cyanide pill?	"This is a new one to the sub. Very interesting with high power players. Ann Woodward was a nightclub dancer and radio actress in the 1940s when she met William Woodward Jr the heir to the Hanover National Bank fortune and the Belair Estate and stud farm and legacy. He was a VERY wealthy man and a big player in NY high society. Allegedly William's father, William Sr had an affair with Ann, then he introduced her to his adult son William Jr who also had an affair with her. Then he divorced his wife and married her. (Insert ""The Aristocrats"" joke here https://www.vulture.com/2012/08/diving-deep-into-the-dirtiest-joke-ever-in-the-aristocrats.html ) William's ex wife was convinced Ann was a gold digger, William obviously disagreed. >The Woodward marriage was reportedly turbulent. Both had affairs, drank frequently and often argued publicly.[8] Ann also began abusing prescription drugs Not so happy ending there. Here is the murder >After attending a dinner party for Wallis Simpson on October 30, 1955, Woodward and his wife returned to their home in Oyster Bay, New York. Both were nervous about reports of a prowler roaming nearby estates, including their own. The Woodwards, both avid hunters, each went to their separate bedrooms that evening with loaded shotguns. >A few hours later, Ann heard a noise on the roof and went into a darkened hallway with her gun, where she saw a shadowy figure standing in front of Woodward's bedroom door. Believing the figure to be a prowler, Ann fired the gun, killing her husband.[9] Upon arriving at the home, police found Ann holding her husband's body and sobbing. She immediately confessed that she had shot her husband because she thought he was a burglar. Ann testified in front of a grand jury and no charges were filed. William's mother then stepped in. The bizarre part here is that it seems like she both suspected her DIL of murder and also helped her with an alibi. >Police later arrested a man named Paul Wirths, who admitted that he had attempted to break into the Woodwards' house on the night of the shooting.[4] Wirths claimed that he had been scared by the sound of gunshots and then left.[10] Woodward's mother Elsie, however, believed that the shooting had been deliberate but publicly supported her daughter-in-law in order to avoid further scandal.[11] **There was speculation that Elsie had paid Wirths to say he had attempted to break into the home in an effort to exonerate Ann** so that was that, things calmed down. That's when famed author and NY high society gad about town Truman Capote comes into the picture. Truman was a fixture at high society parties after writing ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and the true crime classic ""In Cold Blood"" which revolutionized crime writing. >In 1975 Truman Capote published excerpts of his unfinished novel Answered Prayers in Esquire, which scandalized high society.[10] The novel's characters were based on Capote's real-life acquaintances who were prominent socialites of the time.[6][2] The novel revealed scandals and issues within the lives of William S. Paley, Babe Paley, Happy Rockefeller, Gloria Vanderbilt, and Woodward. In the novel, Capote based a character named Ann Cutler, a bigamist and gold digger who shoots her husband, off of Woodward's killing of her husband, implying that it was murder and >The character of Ann Hopkins is then introduced when she surreptitiously walks into the restaurant and sits down with a pastor. Ann Hopkins is likened to Ann Woodward. Ina Coolbirth relates the story of how Mrs. Hopkins ended up murdering her husband. When he threatened to divorce her, she began cultivating a rumour that a burglar was harassing their neighbourhood. The official police report says that while she and her husband were sleeping in separate bedrooms, Mrs. Hopkins heard someone enter her bedroom. In her panic, she grabbed her gun and shot the intruder; unbeknownst to her the intruder was in fact her husband, David Hopkins (or William Woodward, Jr.). Ina Coolbirth suggests however, that Mr. Hopkins was in fact shot in the shower; such is the wealth and power of the Hopkins' family that any charges or whispers of murder simply floated away at the inquest. The fallout of Capote's book was huge. He was forever shunned form high society for revealing their dirty laundry. But for Ann it was just too much. >Answered Prayers caused such a scandal prior to its release, that Woodward killed herself by taking cyanide later that year.[11][9] Her body was discovered on October 10, 1975 in her apartment on Fifth Avenue. Her mother in law said of her death, ""she shot my son, and Truman just murdered her, and so now I suppose we don't have to worry about that anymore.""[6] Subsequently, both of Woodward's sons committed suicide; James in 1976 and William in 1999 So nearly everyone in that family died, either of possible murder or suicide. Truman never finished another book and descended into alcoholism and drugs which eventually killed him.

Anyone else feel like the game has been 'inspected'?	The sudden, huge, reduction in farming requirement is actually quite startling, to the point they're going to limit the resource courses to a daily thing. A lot of people interpret that as a stamina system but let's say the new way gives us enough resources it could be said they have been told by higher ups that the game is far too grindy to attract new players rather than a limit it could be a window for a friendlier arrival for new players.

respect people's pronouns	&#x200B; Its simple respect, just respect how others want to be treated as such. You don't have to agree with them even, but you should just always respect everyone. Asking for someone's pronouns should also be more common. People that disrespect pronouns because they don't agree with a gender non conforming person's ideologies is just an asshole. Just treat people nicely. edit: damn holy fuck a lot of you are assholes &#x200B;	teenagers

I think BF6 will return faith to the community.	One of my biggest frustrations with Dice is when the team split for Battlefront 1. I knew resources diverted would impact the Battlefield series and 5 is proof of that, hell even the launch of Battlefront 2 shows a lot. I feel like with the whole team back together creativity will spark within them. Hopefully the upper management changes because of this too, because we know they have been a huge factor in the downfall of V. I think everyone should be cautious and have a wait and see approach to the next game but I am optimistic about 6.	BattlefieldV

[Spoilers]Is 90 Day Fianc√® like No Sleep? Are we just supposed to pretend it's real?	I like this show, but I just don't know how to approach it. So, we go through this whole thing with David and Lana. We're supposed to believe Lana isn't real: she doesn't talk to him off the pay to chat site, they never speak on the phone (I think?), she never shows up, her picture is on a million websites, etc. Much like with Cesar. And then **WHOOP* there she is!! Did TLC find her and hire her? It makes no sense. But it makes sense if you think about this as a fiction. Was it all made up? Cesar has an acting career and his catfish showed up at the tell all, lots of shock and awe when she showed up at the tell all. What a plot twist! Then the same woman shows up with 90 Day's resident villian, Jesse. And by now it's obvious Jesse is purposefully a bad guy, or a foil, or a heal, whatever. He knows we all (?) hate him, or love to hate him if you're me. But now we have Tom. Two bad guys? Or will Jesse have a character arch and see what happened with Tom and Darcy and come to Darcy's aid? And then Tom will become our new heal. I'm calling it, Williams in some form is going to show up. Maybe the show will dig up the model to tell whatshername that she's being catfished. Is any of it real? Are we just supposed to pretend it's real? What do you do? Am I being pandantic?	90DayFiance

T2 mats for newer players	Hello all, I am not short myself (50,000 of them) but 3 of my alliance pals are short on T2 ability Mats. As we run U7 daily and have done for a while there has been very little in terms of T2s for them. Legacy players were stuck doing U6 for a long time building up a ton of these mats. Newer players don't have that U6 rut. I only see 2 options. 1. Kick them to find an alliance doing U6 or 2. We run U6 a few times a week. Neither seem great tbh. It takes about 20 weeks of U6 daily to get 20,000 (including the challenges). Anyone out there dealt with this? Would appreciate input.	MarvelStrikeForce

Justin as a DM?	"in an amnesty TTAZZ (i think the last one, could be wrong) justin mentioned maybe dming the next campaign (but that itd likely be travis who'll be the dm, which is what ended up happening). personal opinions about previous campaigns aside, i got to wondering what a justin-led campaign would be like, because unless theres a maxfun campaign hes led, hes the only one we havent seen as a dm. i think he has a good eye for pointing out when a scenes dragging along, and he has a pretty good handle on not only his own characters (obviously with some fumbles while finding his footing, but most people do when theyre playing a new character), but also a good eye for pointing out when another character is acting ooc (clint even credits justin as helping him get a grasp on neds character, because he pointed out ned was doing something ooc), which is a really useful skill as a dm. people tend to criticise him for those aspects though, mostly because its the way he goes about it (blunt and rude). whether he's joking around or actually mocking seems to vary from person to person, and the only person who can answer that is justin. my personal thought is that theyre family, and while families can definitely hurt eachother (intentionally or not), its more likely that they know each other better than strangers on the internet would? id say whether hes joking or mocking seems to be interpreted based on peoples personal projections as well (ie with graduation i feel like hes more frustrated than usual because im frustrated with graduation itself). hes also really good at creating a wide variety of characters, from the more charismatically flamboyant tv chef taako to the reluctant ""chosen"" hero charisma vacuum duck to *pepsi liberty*, and every character inbetween. its likely that they stand out from each other because theyve never had to interact, but he has a knack for creating characters that are incredibly distinct and is able to pull them off well, and is way more focused on creating interesting characters than heroic ones. obviously this is all just speculation and the only way to know would for him to actually dm, and if hes not actually interested in being a dm then thatd probably make for a rough campaign if his heart isnt into it, but all that aside i was wondering what other peoples thoughts were? dont want to turn this into a 'justin *should* dm' thread, just a 'what would it be like *if* he did' thread"	TheAdventureZone

Just bought an old apartment. Best way to fix plaster wall where it meets a windowsill?	Hey all. First place I've ever owned, so I have to take this on and fix it myself. Should be a fun learning process. The apartment has old plaster walls (pre-war), and i have to fill a bunch of nail holes and stuff from the previous owner.

Survival (Day 1 : Part 2)	Walking from edge of the forest a ‚ÄúDeer‚Äù like creature moved toward us. I say ‚ÄúDeer‚Äù like creature because it at first glance resembled said animal. At first glance. Once you really looked at it then you saw the difference from a Deer and this animal. The head was similar to that of a deer but, the massive spread of antlers were far too extensive to be that of a deer. How it moved through the thick forest with that spread, I did not know. Next difference was the front legs. Thin like a deer‚Äôs, but longer. It shouldn‚Äôt be just walking towards us. Any normal animal would have run the moment it saw us. Instead it was walking calmly in our direction. It was taller than a deer, but with the same elegant stride. It reached us and continued through giving us no mind. I noted as it got closer that there were more differences to this creature and a Deer. This animal had not one, but two pairs of hind legs. It made its way through us and moved on toward the far end of the clearing. Where it stopped at the edge of the wood, looked about then leaped high in the air and disappear into the woods. For a good ten to fifteen minutes we stood there looking after the animal, that had just walked through us. Too stunned to say anything. Then Someone breathe out, ‚ÄúDid you see the rack on that deer?‚Äù With that the spell was broken and everyone turned to me. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù was the thought everyone had. For about an hour after that, myself and several others made the trip to the river. We were not sure what else to do. I had decide to just start gather my flint like rocks so that I could make tools. RJ and some of the people continued to work on the shelter. What else could we do. I had made three trips, when Sergeant Samuel and her group appeared through the hole in the bushes we had made. In her hand dangled a rabbit like animal. She waved at me. I dropped the load I was carrying, and jogged over. ‚ÄúI just walked up to it. It didn‚Äôt even try to run away? I was able to just reach down and kill it. What the hell is going on? It should have been afraid of us, but nothing. I only saw a few animals. I also noted something too.‚Äù Samuels side as I approached. She stepped to one side and let her group through. Some of them had different berries and small animals. The berries looked like some kind of Blueberries, but the wrong color of blue. ‚ÄúAre the berries good to eat?‚Äù I asked. A woman with dreadlocks spoke up, ‚ÄúI saw the rabbit animals eating them, so they should be OK to eat.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that for sure. So be careful,‚Äù I warned. ‚ÄúWell, if I get sick that should tell us something,‚Äù she replied. I groaned inwardly, but indicated the camp. ‚ÄúFind a clear spot to put the food down,‚Äù I instructed, then turned to Srg. Samuel. ‚ÄúWhat did you note?‚Äù I asked. She watched as everyone filed past her then spoke. ‚ÄúThe animals are not afraid of us, but they are afraid of something.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat did you see, to make you think that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI saw one of the local birds on our way around. I saw it before it saw us. When it heard us approaching it started to go higher into the trees, but then it saw us it stopped and moved back down to get a better look at us. I swear it was the oddest thing I've ever seen. Well how the bird acted, then again I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt see a bird like that before too. Anyhow, the behavior of the animals is strange. I can't explain, but here is something that is scaring the wildlife. It could be regular predators, but I think it‚Äôs something more. There is something else out there, I‚Äôm certain of it.‚Äù I told her about the deer animal and I thought about what she had said. A little later Tim, Rebecca, and their group exited the forest near to where Srg. Samuels had entered. They were laden down with pear like fruit. Tim had a dead bird grasped in his hand. He explained that they had discovered the ‚ÄúPear‚Äù Tree not far from the north edge of the woods, there was a small grove of the trees. Also that there were quite a few birds living in them. I told Samuel and him about the river and the strange fish. Tim wanted to go see the river and Samuel decided to go to. I took them down our rough path and showed them the river. We arrived just as Mama Fisher and Sheila pulled a big fish from the water. They had a few fishes piled behind them. Mama Fisher called to us as we approached. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had it this easy catching fish before. If I knew this place existed I would have come sooner.‚Äù Tim and Samuel looked up and down the river, inspecting the bank ‚ÄúHave you explored very far either way?‚Äù Srg. Samuel asked. Sheila spoke up, ‚ÄúI started to, but came back to help Mama F.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need to. I don‚Äôt know what resources are around here but we are going to need to find what we can.‚Äù Srg. Samuel stated. Then added, ‚ÄúIt is getting a little late.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe should take back what you have here. We‚Äôve got a good amount of food, and we need to start fires so we can cook.‚Äù I interjected. Everyone agreed and we began to gather up the fish. I had gathered up a armful of fish when I looked across the river. I was able to duck just in time as one of the Six legged deers leaped from one side of the river to the other. It Rushed over me and crashed landed six or seven feet past me. It jumped to its feet and rushed off into the forest. We looked after it for a second then looked back across the river. A group of strange bipedal three foot tall, scaly animals spilled out of the trees on the other side. All I really saw were their big head‚Äôs full of pointed teeth. They rushed down to the water‚Äôs edge and slid to a stop, seeming unwilling to go into the water. They chirped and hooted at each other, and stared across the water at us. Very quietly Tim whispered, ‚Äúeveryone back away slowly. Don‚Äôt make any sudden moves.‚Äù We slowly began to back away, the short velociraptor looking creatures watched us their long tails moving back and forth. We made it to the edge of the woods and scooted over to the hole in the brush we created. The whole time the toothy critter watched us with unblinking eyes. Slowly we retreated down the path till we were out of site. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll,‚Äù I said softly, ‚ÄúI think we found what the other animals are afraid of.‚Äù Mama F breathed out, ‚ÄúDid you see the teeth on those kani‚Äôa?‚Äù Sergeant Samuel stared back the way we came and replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what those monsters are but I think we're going to need to make slight change to our survival plans.‚Äù We gather everyone together once we arrived back at camp and explained what we had seen. Everyone asked what we were going to do about this threat? The only thing I could think of was to build a wall round our camp and hope the predators couldn‚Äôt jump. Also I was starting to feel glad I had gather some of the flint like rocks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need to build defensive's, for now wooden wall‚Äôs to keep the predators out. If anyone knows how to flint knap come help me work on some flint tools. Everyone else needs to stay close to camp. Don‚Äôt wander off alone. If you need to go out into the woods go in groups. We still need more wood and stuff for fire.‚Äù I indicated the man I had put in charge of wood gathering. ‚ÄúHow much have we gathered?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWe should have enough gathered to last all night. But if we have to start using it for other stuff it won't last long.‚Äù I thought about that for a second. ‚ÄúOK, we need to start getting fires going. Everyone who know how to start a fire need to do so. I‚Äôll start on making flint tools. We need people to keep a lookout. Four or five people need to go back down to the river and keep an eye out there. If you think you see any of the creatures get back here ASAP. We‚Äôll try and be ready for them.‚Äù Everyone went to it. Myself, Edward, and three other people sat down with our stones and began to work on them. I got the flint like stone a little longer than my hand. With harder stone began to carefully chip at the flint stone. It was harder to do then with regular flint but I seemed to get the same result. I keep the chips that came off, I could use them for other stuff later. Chip by chip I began forming my ax head. It took at least a hour to do one ax, in which time Mama F and some others had gone back to the river. Not seeing our little friends she and other gathered up the dropped fish. They brought them back and I gave them some of the flint chips so that they could cut and clean out the fish. Our firewood gatherer, Stefen, had brought us some branches so that we could make handles for our axes. While I and the others began making more ax heads, Edward took the branches and stripped them of bark. Taking two stones, one with a point and one to use to hit the pointed one, he began to chisel out a slot that our ax heads could fit in. Doc Bitterbeer had, as he had said he would, taking the bushes we had cut and began making twine with them. When he had gotten eight of them made he gave them to Edward. Edward in turn took the finished ax heads and put one into the slot he had made in a branch and use the twine to secure the ax head to the branch. All that work for just one ax. Edward gave the ax to one of the people helping RJ. That person took the ax and began chopping at a small tree for better wood, to make better shelters. For the rest of the day we made tools. RJ and his group erected shelters. Mama F and six or seven people made trips to the river, guarded by Sergeant Samuel. Tim and Rebecca cleared the brush near to were the ‚ÄòPear‚Äô trees were. Giving Doc more fiber to work with. Tim and Rebecca gathered more of the fruit. A man named Alexander, had began making fire pits and starting fires. Wisely he had lined the fire pits with stones. Mama F had started preparing the fish for eating, once Alexander had the first fire going she took over and began cooking the fish on flat stones. By that time we were sure the berries were safe to eat , the woman with the dreadlocks, Diane, had not gotten sick so we were fairly sure they were good too. All told we had enough food to barely feed all of us. Sergeant Samuel had taking a rough head count, there was about four hundred and six people. Both jet planes must have been fully loaded to take all of us. RJ would not have enough shelters make by night fall so most of us would have to sleep on the ground. With the local insect not bothering us it might not be too bad. The biggest concern was the water. Could we safely drink it? Two of the people with Mama F group had drank some water, and so far they seemed fine. But it was too soon to be sure. I was becoming very parched, and so were others. We might have to risk it, soon. As the sun began to set, my hands were cramped, I had smashed my finger multiple times, my back ached from being hunched over, but in return we had between the five of us had made 10 axes, four spear heads, and three knives. Stefan had not found branches long enough for the spears, because RJ and use so many to make shelters. We would have to wait for the morning to get one of the axes and chop some branches or small trees to make the spear shafts. Mama F gave me a flat stone with a chunk of fish, two slices of the ‚ÄòPears‚Äô (which were fairly hard and tasted like a mix of pear and peaches), also I got a hand full of light blue blueberries ( the tasted like blueberries with a tangy after flavor), and a little of the ‚Äòrabbit‚Äô meat. All in all not a filling meal, but the Fish tasted good, so not a total bummer. Mama F came by a little later with shallow rock with water in it. ‚ÄúI heated up this water, hopefully its safe to drink.‚Äù She said offering me a drink. I drank a little, the hot water tasted like cooked fish and berries, not the normal flavor I like my water. I thanked her and drank a little more, and she moved on to other people. Before trying to lie down for the night I went and found Staff Sergeant Samuel. She had appropriated one of the axes and was keeping watch on the east side of the clearing. ‚ÄúAnything to report,‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo. After first interaction, we haven‚Äôt seen tooth or scale of the little monsters. They could be just inside the treeline for all we know or they could be miles from here. We just don‚Äôt know,‚Äù She said watching the path. ‚ÄúThey seemed hesitant to cross the water. So hopefully they'll not cross over just yet.‚Äù Srg. Samuel glanced side long at me and replied, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll I‚Äôm not going to assume that their not going to cross. We‚Äôll be prepared in any case. I won't feel safe till we at least have a wall between, us and those creatures.‚Äù I nodded in agreement and watch with her till the sun set. I woke sometime in the middle of the night to something I haven't heard since I was a little kid camping with my family in Yellowstone National Park. The long howl drifted on the wind from somewhere far off. It waxed and waned for several minutes. Finally it died down, and it went quiet. I wonder if I could fall back to sleep, with my nerves so unsettled. Then just at the edge of my hearing range from the south came answering howls. Not just one voice, but many. It was too far away for me to make anything out for sure, but there were many different pitches and were held for different amounts of time. Almost everyone was up now listening to the howls. Shocked and pail faces looked at each other. The only thing I knew for sure was without a doubt those were wolf howls. I will never forget the sound of wolves howls. That night, long ago were my brother and I and our parents sat in our camper as a pack of wolves sat not far from us and howled was seared into my memory. Where ever we were there were wolves out there. It almost almost made me believe we were still somewhere at home. That is until I looked and saw many people looking up into the night sky. I looked up too. There sitting in the sky was A moon. Not our moon, this moon look smaller and at its north end an giant crater could be seen. And ridding not too far behind the first moon a smaller moon followed the first. Bright blue light shine off the small moon and a more familiar shine came from the first moon. We were not on earth for sure now. My heart shrank a little with this knowledge. I knew that we were not going home, where every home was we were out here on our own. Unable to get back to sleep, I went to relieve Sergeant Samuel. When I got there another man was waiting there. Sergeant Samuel nowhere in site. The man gave me salute. ‚ÄúPrivate First Class Francis O‚ÄôMalley, USMC. I relived the Staff Sergeant an hour ago, Sir.‚Äù I nodded back at him. I had seen the Marine at the Renaissance Festival the week before, several times in fact. He had been with several other guys at the time too. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt get back to sleep, Sir?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúNo, not after hearing those wolves, and seeing the Two moons,‚Äù I explained. O‚ÄôMalley nodded, and pointed to the horizon. ‚ÄúWell not just two moons,‚Äù he said as I followed his pointed finger. There on the horizon a curve of another moon was just peeking. ‚ÄúIt's been coming up since I‚Äôve on watch.‚Äù I marveled at that fact. The moon was just barely visible a slight sliver on the horizon. ‚ÄúThat's one slow moon,‚Äù I commented. I was slightly startled when Sergeant Samuel‚Äôs voice came from behind us. ‚ÄúIt was trying to get up an hour before O‚ÄôMalley relieved me. It feels like the first two blasted past it.‚Äù Private O‚ÄôMalley came to attention. Samuels waved him off. ‚ÄúAre there any other military folks?‚Äù I question. ‚ÄúNo one who was currently serving,‚Äù was the reply from Samuels. ‚ÄúWhat about the guys I saw you were with during the Renaissance Festival, O‚ÄôMalley?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey left two days ago. Once my little brother had been ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù from the jousting tournament, he and the guys left to go to the beach. I was going back home after the Festival. I‚Äôve got in enough trouble on the beach in the past, so I didn‚Äôt want to go.‚Äù He reminisced. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some people who retired from all branches here. Just not a whole lot. Doc Bitterbeer said he was in the Brazilian medical corp for a couple of years, but got booted out. And I‚Äôve talked to a former British Royal Engineer, Margret was in it from 18 till she was 25. She the closest to an officer we have. But she‚Äôs too gunshy from her experience in Afghanistan, so she‚Äôll be little help if it ever comes to a fight. All the rest are willing and ready to help. I‚Äôve talked to them throughout the day.‚Äù I digested this information, and watch the third moon try rise. Finally I felt tired enough to fall back to sleep. I went back to where my campfire was, and laid down near to it.	stories

Queria ter algu√©m com empatia e algum conhecimento pra poder me escutar e aconselhar. Mas tenho medo de algu√©m me expor! Me fazer mal! Mal consigo comer de ang√∫stia.	desabafos

It will cover all aspects of object oriented programming in python, from creating classes to static methods to composition! Everything is explained clearly in an easy to understand way, and if you don't understand anything, I reply to comments usually within 24 hours. Here is the link to the first video, where I explain classes and instances. The next video will be out tomorrow, explaining methods and attributes: [https://youtu.be/r5BgVJNB5JA](https://youtu.be/r5BgVJNB5JA) I hope those looking into object oriented programming in python will find this useful!

What happened?Why I dont have fun in single player games anymore?I keep uninstalling the games 1 hour after playing...	Hey!Im a 16 years old male and I feel like I cant play single player games anymore even tho I want to. I switched from Ps4 to PC in March,I was soo hyped to try out all the single player games I wanted to play in PC with 60 fps,max graphics and graphic mods.Also online games like Overwatch,R6S,Apex and Gmod.But I was mainly focus to play Single player games again because of the graphics and complet the storyline all by myself. But anyways,I installed Max Payne 3,GTA 5,GTA 4,Sleeping Dogs,Mafia 2,Mafia 3,Ghost recon wildlands,Need for Speed heat,Forza Horizone 4,Watch dogs 1 & 2... But I ended up uninstalling all of them the first hours in.I wanted to complet all of those games by myself because of the amazing graphics in max settings,their story,attention to details,atmosphere,mods and things to do,for NFS And FH,for their luxury and old school cars that I can drift around and do races with it.But nope,I got strangly bored first hours into all of these games.Sometimes I reinstall those games again and STILL uninstall the first hour in!Its like im giving it another change but I dont feel fun playing those games even tho I want to play them so bad if that makes sense! I think I kinda need a 100% savegame so I can enjoy the game and do random stuff in the city but I actually want to do the missions but the beginning of the story in a game is not fun!Even tho I want to play the beginning too because I want to complet the game all by myself in style and know what the story is all about! My situation is so weird.Same for multiplayer games but I find my interest back to a game then not play it for a long time.Like r6s,I start to play it all day,and not touching it until the next weeks.This happens for all the online games I mentionned.Now im currently playing overwatch and Apex.Im sure ill switch up to Gmod and R6s soon for a week then come back on these other games. I really dont know what happen,this didnt happen for me in PS2,PSP and when I start playing in PS4...I completed the games again and again and found sooo much fun in it!Jake and Daxter series is the perfect exemple,I played hours into those games and there was an unforgettable amount of fun for the open world and story!It was flawless! Now I have a PC that I always wished for and wouldnt even stick to the games and finish them like I was doing on console...	gaming

I had an idea to solve the repetitive dialogue options when catching bugs/fish/clams	"If you're familiar with playing any game from the Zelda franchise, you probably know that you get a small dialogue from the first time you collect a rupee the first time you load into your save file. So, for the uninitiated, if you load into your file and collect a red rupee, it will say something like ""You collected 20 rupees, don't spend it all in one place!"" Then every time you collect one after that, it's automatically added to your wallet without the dialogue pop-up. I think this could apply pretty well to animal crossing. Say you load into your file and catch a sea bass, you would get the dialogue as usual. Then, every sea bass you catch afterwards would be automatically added after the animation of catching it. This would reset so that every time you open your game, you get a dialogue pop-up on your first catch and not again until the next time you open animal crossing. I feel it would save some time for players who've seen the prompts multiple times."	AnimalCrossing
I am very sick, weak immune system, disabled, and need my dog.. I‚Äôm scared to be homeless again but it‚Äôs coming soon.	I am 21, almost 22. I do not know if I will have a car or not, depends if my parents wanna be extra f*cked up or not (they have 2 EXTRA). I have $90. rooms here are cheap like $300-400/month, hotels and motels can be more expensive though, i‚Äôm gonna try to call ones i stayed at before with an ex to see if they do discounts for a month.. i really need somewhere i can go with my ESA dog. i should never be alone, i can‚Äôt take care of myself. i can‚Äôt remember the day, the time, sometimes what i‚Äôm even doing, remember my meds, remember where my phone is, or other important things. but i try to be my best when i‚Äôm alone, i just have cognitive issues from my physical illnesses :/ i need to have my dog, but i‚Äôll have to get food and find a place for both of us. she is everything to me and i bought her and trained her as my ESA. i have 2 other dogs i just see as pets, she is actually there for me in other ways. and is friendly, behaved in public, good with all animals, but would be protective if i need her to. like she is good and letting me know when people are around, when i would not notice because of my issues. which is a big fear for me because someone can easily come up and target me and i can‚Äôt defend myself due to my muscle issues and cognitive issues and it‚Äôs scary. i‚Äôve already been a victim of random violent crime in my city so it scares me. i have been sick over a month now with stomach issues my doctor thinks i need my gallbladder out but something was off with my liver too. i have the consult friday. that‚Äôs why i can stay this week. this plus the issues i‚Äôve had since i was 13, 17, i have an incredibly weak immune system. i do have masks, but what triggered my disease was a virus in the first place. so it‚Äôs scary to think if i had to go to a shelter alone without my dog, i‚Äôd probably catch corona and idk it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. i also can‚Äôt really live in a shelter lifestyle, due to my symptoms and limitations and how i need to rest and all that.. and i just seriously am a huge target. i‚Äôm so fucking naive and my illnesses make it worse. my cognitive issues are so bad right now. i‚Äôm considering contacting churches i went to as a kid for assistance but idk what they can do for me.. or how to ask for help i‚Äôm also considering trying to sell stuff to make enough money to get a room for as long as i can. i already posted to craigslist to see if anyone can help accommodate my dog and i for weekly or a month and to lmk how much they‚Äôd charge.. i don‚Äôt wanna do this if i have to be alone and on the street.. being on the street with one person was hard enough and now with the virus, i just feel it‚Äôs too much to even be possible and definitely not worth it i also would have to get a new phone and service which i‚Äôd want straight talk. i don‚Äôt need a lot cause i don‚Äôt do texting/calling/phone stuff like that really	almosthomeless

Wow, the longbow is bad!	Seriously needs a buff. I was using it there with iron sights fired 4 shots at mid range. 37 damage hit again 37 again 37 and again 37. That's 4 perfect bodyshot in a row with a sniper with iron sights not an easy task at distane where my opponent is just a few pixels and he's caustic so he just shrugs it off like it's nothing and gets away. Why would you ever snipe in this game if your rate of fire and magazine size is so low. Every sniper in this game needs a buff. Kraber excluded obviously. What do you think??	apexlegends

[Selling] Kashmina 150mm Blue#2 petty, and Shiro Kamo 165mm Blue#2 Nakiri. [UK/EU]	Hi, First up is a Kashima Warikomi 150mm Blue#2 petty, iron clad (from cleancut, https://www.cleancut.eu/butik/knifetype/allknivar/bunka_warikomi-2470-detail). Octagonal handle, walnut. Pictures here https://imgur.com/a/DqoqsEb This is a cheap petty which usually goes for 80e (+15e cleancut p&p). The F&F is usually not great, but the grind on this particular one is quite good, and it's quite a thin petty with a decent amount of height. I polished the choil area by myself (they come completely unfinished, you can still see some of the machine scratches there which I could not get out by hand), and it has also had a light thinning, and I have used a JNS synthetic aoto to get some of the contrast back. It's not perfect, but IMO it looks better than new (they come with a coating which prevents rust, I have taken this off). I have also sealed the gaps between the steel/handle with beeswax. You can also see there is a slight mark in the handle which is where the stone hit the handle while thinning. The handle otherwise is great (it's pakka ferrule and walnut handle, I've given it a fresh coat of wax). I have sharpened this, so you will get it nice and sharp. The blade and edge itself is straight, and is centered in the handle, although it's twisted slightly, and goes off to one side slightly, but considering the size of the knife, this is not perceptible when you're using it (this is actually the reason I sent back the first 2 petties I bought, but this one didnt bother me) I am selling it for **¬£50** incl P&P (for postage to EU, contact me). If you are not happy, you are welcome to return it, but I think it's a great little knife, very light. I am selling it because I have the smaller version of this petty. Second we have a Shiro Kamo Blue#2 Nakiri (from cleancut again, https://www.cleancut.eu/butik/knifetype/nakiri/nakiri2013-08-22-12-33-182013-08-22-12-33-18-2-detail). Right handed D-shaped handle. Pictures here https://imgur.com/a/o3uWqNF This is a **laser** nakiri. This is as thin as it gets. I have attempted to remove all traces of patina with rust eraser/3000 grit sandpaper, it looks almost like new (the scratches from factory were also perpendicular to the spine so I tried to keep this) but there is some evidence of patina if you look hard enough, but these traces will be gone in a single use as it's really quite reactive. **This has been used about 15 or so times, lightly, and not been sharpened**. It is still sharp, but could do with a touch-up, but I will leave that to you unless you want me to give it a quick sharpen. The F&F is great, the blade is centered perfectly, the edge and spine are straight, the handle is smooth. The grind is very thin, because the blade itself is thin there is some flex. I have sealed a tiny gap between the steel and the handle with beeswax. I have not oiled or waxed the handle yet as it doesn't seem to need it.

Slipped yet again	What do you know? I tried to keep from drinking on my own, and it didn't work. Nothing went according to plan yesterday, and I really pissed off my partner. I thought I would try some controlled drinking, just to be sure, and blacked out. Based on my experience, I will know not to drink for a month or so before I end up with the bottle. I would love to hear some encouraging words from anyone who failed many times before achieving long term sobriety, also, any recommendations are welcome. Thanks for being here y'all!	alcoholicsanonymous

Fair warning - If you were over paid at all the IRS will hold your ENTIRE tax refund until they get things figured out.	In case anyone else is in this situation- My mother was overpaid because she filed as a qualifying widow in 2018. Her 2019 return was over $7000. They held the entire amount for the $1200 that they overpaid, and no one can tell us when the rest will be released. We never received a letter, and the only information we got at all through the IRS portal was that it was being offset for the ENTIRE amount, and to call the treasury. Don‚Äôt be surprised if it happens to you - you‚Äôll get no information.	stimuluscheck
I'm at a loss	Probably should be posting this in /r/relationships but here goes: I want to break up with my current girlfriend. For months now. While I'm happy with our relationship, the fights that we have are unbearable. It usually starts with something minor that I did (taking something I suggested as ordering her around, playful teasing, hell even the playful banters evolve into full blown fights). The thing with these fights is that she's big on amends. She wants me to make up in some way and until I do, she treats me more or less like trash. I think that over the times that this happened, i eventually lost interest in genuinely making amends and just resort to saying whatever just to appease her. Which is not me. And now, it's taking a toll with my mental health. We've been together for over a year, there's been ups and downs, and somehow during those down times I've convinced myself that things will get better. That we'll both be mature enough to deal with arguments better. But it didn't. It's always me having to patch up things with her. Sure, it's all fun when we're not fighting, but when we do, I feel less and less in love with her. But i don't know how to breakup with her. I know that if I do, she'll self-harm, or worse, kill herself. I just know she'll do it. She has issues that I don't think I can help with alone. Being the only reason for her to go on in life isn't good for her either. So yeah, I'm at a loss.	CasualPH

M4F 27 #Bergen - Here to help you socially distance your legs from one another.	Looking for a fun and gorgeous freak that wants to have discrete fun somewhere in NJ. The quarantine has my testosterone peaking and I am very much in the mood to touch, taste, and ravage you. I am muscular and fit with dark features and currently have a beard. I am naturally dominant and enjoy light BDSM, eating pussy and ass, manhandling, and light objectification and degradation. In short, I really just want to use you up and then cuddle you in my arms like a good girl. We can do this all day since everyone is working from home. I can host or come to you. You must be DDF with a recent test. Would be open to raw play if you‚Äôre clean. I am able to exchange pics immediately via Snapchat or Kik. I‚Äôd want to meet up this week. I have not been exposed to anyone with COVID and have been under strict quarantine. Really just want to break quarantine to give you a good dicking. Put your favorite sex song in the subject line and respond with a few kinky ideas you‚Äôd be interested in trying. I am most likely open to your fantasies/fetishes. Don‚Äôt be shy.	NJr4r

Switched batteries, now lights stay on without the key inserted. Any ideas?	So my bike was stolen out of my college apartment complex last month, but the police found it a few days ago and I went to pick it up. It didn‚Äôt seem like anything was missing from it, and it seems like whoever took it just left it outside for a month (fuck me right) The thing started beautifully when I replaced the battery, but after I rode it around the block and took out the key, I noticed all the lights were still on - mainly the headlights and rear light, as if it were still running. Further, you can start it without the key inserted as well. My theory was whoever stole it might‚Äôve tried hot wiring it and screwed up somewhere between the ignition and battery, but I was wondering any of you have had a similar experience. Thanks for your help!	motorcycles

This gem from r/banvideogames	Not all gamers are bad. In fact, there are good ones. For example, I'm a good gamer. I'm not racist and have NEVER said anything racist, I don't support or advocate any form of racism or anything that you people say we promote on this subreddit, and I never will. I don't go and call people disrespectful things. Yeah, I may see inappropriate things in games sometimes, but I don't let that influence me. I know that things I do in games should stay in games. If anything, gaming to me is nothing more than entertainment and a way of passing time. Just because a few gamers have done bad stuff in the past, it doesn't mean that all gamers are like that, and I certainly won't let videogames have that effect on me. But I'm still going to keep playing, because I enjoy it, as I have done for about 10 years. Downvote, brigade, do whatever. I don't care. But at the end of the day, I'm trying to prove a point here.	copypasta

Quarantine has been PRODUCTIVE! 4 WORKS ON WATTPAD	For over 20 years I've written works without compiling them into one place.During quarantine I've put my written works together and have now 4 works (2 complete) going on Wattpad with new works being updated DAILY as I still have tons to go through. My writing goal has always been working within my own created Universe. My writing revolves around dark fantasy and neo-noir elements that I have molded into a world that highlights the struggles between the Fallen and Divine. I am also lucky to have the very talented Vanessa Trueba [https://www.instagram.com/nessa\_ninona/](https://www.instagram.com/nessa_ninona/) lending her talents for my Revelations series with chapters from Book III finally being uploaded after a 7 year hiatus.

ContraPoints‚Äô theory of cringe - what motivates us to snark?	Natalie Wynn aka ContraPoints posted a really excellent video yesterday called [‚ÄúCringe.‚Äù](https://youtu.be/vRBsaJPkt2Q) She draws a distinction between embarrassment cringe and contemptuous cringe - essentially, cringing with someone vs cringing AT them. Watching the video I couldn‚Äôt help but think of the CC snark community, and by the end I was feeling rather morally implicated myself, and was definitely left questioning what I am doing on this sub and why I follow caroline. If you have an hour and a half to spare (and let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs quarantine baby, most of us have nothing but time), I highly recommend checking the video out. There has already been a bit of discussion on the general thread, but I really think there is so much to talk about here. I‚Äôll copy/paste a bit of what I said in the general: I also felt like a lot of what she talked about could be related to caroline and the snark community, especially her idea of ‚Äúmorbid cringe‚Äù where hate following becomes an obsession. I know watching an hour and a half video of kind of a big ask for some but I would really like to hear what people here have to say about their motivations for snarking after watching CP‚Äôs cringe vid. CP makes the case that a lot of people who hate follow a cringe figure do so because that figure reminds them of something they dislike about themselves, which she calls in group cringe. Personally I think there‚Äôs a bit of truth to that last point because I do suspect most of the people in this community are also white women. (Btw has there ever been a demographics type poll on here? There should be.) But I don‚Äôt think that can neatly explain why snarkers snark. People outside the subreddit sometimes come in and say we‚Äôre basically all just jealous of her, and although I think there‚Äôs more to it than that I also think there‚Äôs a shred of truth to that statement as well. The most common sentiment I see on here is basically ‚ÄúI work so much harder than CC but I don‚Äôt have what she has, and that‚Äôs not fair.‚Äù I feel like that comes closer to what strikes a nerve with most people on here. Even though it‚Äôs a CC snark subreddit, it‚Äôs almost about more than CC - she‚Äôs almost like an avatar for the general phenomena of unearned privilege, toxic white womanhood, failing upward, etc. So the in group cringe idea is not quite right here because I don‚Äôt think most people here are reminded of themselves by CC, but I DO think that for most of us she does hit on some sort of insecurity or frustration about our own life circumstances. But let me know what y‚Äôall think. ________ As someone pointed out in the general thread, I think for most of us our initial knee jerk response is to distance ourselves from the cringe trolls Natalie references in her video, or even from the other people on this subreddit - ‚Äúwell I haven‚Äôt done x y z so I‚Äôm not as bad as them.‚Äù But the fact of the matter is we all come together here to essentially make fun of a deeply mentally ill woman, and that‚Äôs never going to be a 100% morally righteous thing. However, unlike the trolls in CP‚Äôs video, and despite what people unfamiliar with the sub would probably think, I actually believe the people here can be trusted to have an intelligent, self aware discussion about why we are actually here and what we get out of snarking on CC. So I encourage you all to share your thoughts here. üòä	SmolBeanSnark

So I did some maths,	And I found that 1 = -1 Now hear me out, this is clearly wrong... I still think its wierd. I started by establishing two numbers: p = lim(x->inf)1/x, q = lim(x->inf)(-1/x) Both of these approach zero, which means p = q, and -p = q. Then I thought about divisions. If a = b, then a/b = 1. If (-a)=b, then a/b = -1 Which means that, p/q = 1, but p/q also = -1. Therefore 1 = -1 I originally did this because I wanted to show that p and q aren't equal, I am sure someone will point out my error, but idgaf.	teenagers

Mas eu t√¥ querendo melhorar minha pron√∫ncia nessa √°rea porque o ingl√™s americano n√£o soa bem no meu ouvido kkkk, e meu pr√≥prio sotaque torna muito dif√≠cil e for√ßado o rr (sou Maranhense e o sotaque da gente √© bem neutro com o rr, ao contr√°rio dos paulistas que tem o rr bem similar ao ingl√™s americano, e pra eles √© mais f√°cil simular esses sons). S√≥ que t√¥ tendo uma certa dificuldade de achar canais de nativos com t√≥picos aleat√≥rios no YouTube, n√£o quero s√≥ ouvir professores que falam pra gente entender e n√£o soa muito descontra√≠do e natural.

My party robbed the Blue Water Inn BLIND	Ash, Huck, Pablo, Stagla & Vala - why you gotta keep doing me like this?? Also stop reading NOW. So. My party has had a lot going on lately; a battle through the streets of Vallaki against Strahds children of the night (what music they make) and a close call with the BBEG (who the cleric thought would be a LITERAL pushover - don‚Äôt try that at home kids, Strahds opposed strength check ain‚Äôt nothing to be sneezed at) so they decided to take some R&R at the Inn after a long day... It turns out that part of that is robbing the ever loving crap out of the Martikovs. They subdued the ravens in record time, raided the hidden chest, found the secret door to the Martikov‚Äôs room, found the trapdoor, managed to figure out a stealth approach up and proceeded to rob the attic. Now I‚Äôm left unsure how to handle this. There were no witnesses, and they were smart enough to go back out the way they came in (through the stables), however they failed to remember to clean up the raven corpses, and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Unwin, Danika or the others discovers what has happened. Would the party be under immediate suspicion as the newbies in town? Would they confront the party themselves, have them be spied on to see if they are the culprits, call the town authorities (although I think they‚Äôd be loath to do that as much of that coin is tied to their secret society) or if the party gets out of town fast enough, do they just get away with it? I‚Äôm really unsure how to play this. Thank you for taking the time to read my novel, and any advice would be greatly appreciated! Tl;dr - my party robbed the inn, and now I‚Äôm unsure how this will effect the game going forward	CurseofStrahd
Stop relapsing today | Dopamine hack to stop relapsing	"You all know about exercising everything else. My issue with them is they fall under category of delayed gratification meaning? The reward from all them takes time to come. You can do all or some of these following things to get daily self-motivation if you are relapsing constantly or feel the urge to beat ine out. 1. Set the number of days for this subreddit. 2. Post an urge report, you will see your own day progress...you will get instant motivation from that. 3. Read atleast one positive article. Mind you this should be positive article. 4. Reach out to someone who have successfully completed several days. They are more than willing to help, they understand you better because they literally went through what you are going through. 5. This can by far be the most amazing hack. Set a stop watch from the time you relapsed. If you feel demotivated just look at the numbers of hours that have passed. You will get that dopamine kick reward. Although lower dose than PMO but, it will get you motivated and make you realized how far you've actually come. 6. Mantra to stop fapping. Say this to yourself when you feel the urge ""ougga bugga caveman want to touch pee pee"" picked this up somewhere in this subreddit by far the best thing yet. 7. Enjoy this process, there is no finish line, there is no winner or looser each day is a victory. Celebrate the small wins and it will soon compound to something amazing. Don't take yourself too seriously. Love yourself and your body will return the love 100 folds. Goodluck to everyone starting out. My wishes are with you. To those who relapsed, it's alright you fell down now pick yourself up and get back to it. Glory awaits us my brothers."	NoFap

Justin as a DM?	"in an amnesty TTAZZ (i think the last one, could be wrong) justin mentioned maybe dming the next campaign (but that itd likely be travis who'll be the dm, which is what ended up happening). personal opinions about previous campaigns aside, i got to wondering what a justin-led campaign would be like, because unless theres a maxfun campaign hes led, hes the only one we havent seen as a dm. i think he has a good eye for pointing out when a scenes dragging along, and he has a pretty good handle on not only his own characters (obviously with some fumbles while finding his footing, but most people do when theyre playing a new character), but also a good eye for pointing out when another character is acting ooc (clint even credits justin as helping him get a grasp on neds character, because he pointed out ned was doing something ooc), which is a really useful skill as a dm. people tend to criticise him for those aspects though, mostly because its the way he goes about it (blunt and rude). whether he's joking around or actually mocking seems to vary from person to person, and the only person who can answer that is justin. my personal thought is that theyre family, and while families can definitely hurt eachother (intentionally or not), its more likely that they know each other better than strangers on the internet would? id say whether hes joking or mocking seems to be interpreted based on peoples personal projections as well (ie with graduation i feel like hes more frustrated than usual because im frustrated with graduation itself). hes also really good at creating a wide variety of characters, from the more charismatically flamboyant tv chef taako to the reluctant ""chosen"" hero charisma vacuum duck to *pepsi liberty*, and every character inbetween. its likely that they stand out from each other because theyve never had to interact, but he has a knack for creating characters that are incredibly distinct and is able to pull them off well, and is way more focused on creating interesting characters than heroic ones. obviously this is all just speculation and the only way to know would for him to actually dm, and if hes not actually interested in being a dm then thatd probably make for a rough campaign if his heart isnt into it, but all that aside i was wondering what other peoples thoughts were? dont want to turn this into a 'justin *should* dm' thread, just a 'what would it be like *if* he did' thread"	TheAdventureZone

Short Story: Bearing The Word	‚ÄúAnd we bear the word‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd we bear the word‚Äù they replied. It was a strange sermon, actually now that Sunstret began to think about it, the chaplain‚Äôs sermons recently had taken a new tone. There wasn‚Äôt even a single mention of the Emperor in its entirety, which was highly unusual for.. ‚ÄúThe word serves you Sunstret‚Äù interrupted a voice from behind. ‚ÄúAh.. The word serves you too Marres.‚Äù Sunstret kept walking down the corridor away from the chapel, it was odd to be talking to Marres. He had been a member of the Serrated Suns, the now Gal Vorbak, and Sunstret had never thought fondly of him. Too strongly opinionated for his tastes. ‚ÄúMay I join you in training? I see you‚Äôre heading down.‚Äù He was, Sunstret wasn‚Äôt sure how, but he had started down the wrong hallway. It was too late to save face and turn back towards his quarters. ‚ÄúI am. I need to go back to basics on my hand to hand combat. It has been a weakness of mine.‚Äù ‚ÄúA weakness that can only be compared to the enemy you are facing. But It is good to know that you know your flaws.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see my flaw as something for me and I need to make sure that I am ready for my lord, my company and my emperor.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see your point, but how do you serve the emperor? The likelihood of a fist being effective against a witch is only something a son of Dorn would think. It is a very individual form of battle with little to no use to your company of brothers.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe fist has its uses but being disarmed is never something we expect, it‚Äôs something we must plan for. I find that it is the simplest form, there is no extension of my body as I become the weapon I must be.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat about training in different forms of blade? Losing one's chainblade does not mean that you can not find a new weapon. Being tactile and adaptive would be more prudent than putting one‚Äôs faith in your own faults.‚Äù Sunstret was feeling impatient and annoyed that this conversation was even occurring. As he walked into the open hall, he was glad that there was no one else to hear the drivel that was coming from the Serrated Sun. ‚ÄúMarres, you should know this, the only way we can prove ourselves to our cousins and ourselves is to own our flaws and make them our strengths.‚Äù ‚ÄúI did not think our cousins have anything to do with your weapon of choice in the sparring ring. But now that you mention them, what do you think they see as our flaws brother?‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no idea Marres, I am no Wolf, Raven nor Angel. I am a proud son of Lorgar and I have no desire to think like one of our cousins would.‚Äù ‚ÄúA good answer, not great or even useful; but I like it because it is tactile. It does not answer my question but it is clear what you believe in.‚Äù As Sunstret took his shirt off, he leant over to the nearby servitor to start preparing for hand to hand training. ‚ÄúThis is not a philosophy lesson Marres. I train to make myself a better Word Bearer. We are not the strongest legion..‚Äù he saw a sign of pain on Marres‚Äô face ‚Äúyes I said it. We were humbled by our emperor, but this is for a good reason: so that we may rebuild ourselves to be stronger than who we were.‚Äù ‚ÄúThen there is something that we both agree on.‚Äù Sunstret turned towards the training arena. If he was going to get some training done, he would have to turn away from Marres‚Äô ramblings and hope that his brother would get the hint and chastise someone who needed to be taught how to be a bearer of the word. ‚ÄúBut unfortunately, you have not seen the truth that the emperor has taught us..‚Äù ‚ÄúMarres! I have seen the truth. You know it too, we have taken the emperor as a god, when he is not.‚Äù He voiced as the servitor began its first round of training. ‚ÄúThe truth!‚Äù Marres chuckled. A pain began to draw within Sunstret‚Äôs chest. He looked down to see red on the servitor, on the ground, on him. ‚ÄúThe truth is that the false god has made us adapt, to look further than his words and see that there are different gods worthy of Lorgar‚Äôs communion. We never expected his betrayal, but you are right..‚Äù He twisted his blade, ‚Äúit is something that we must plan for. Become an extension of the word, our gods, our daemons.‚Äù Weakness started to flow from Sunstret‚Äôs failing primary heart. It started with his legs, then his fists. He was light headed and had no way to move his body. The sword that impaled him must have severed his spinal cord as well. ‚ÄúIt seems poetic then, that you are paralized by my betrayal. It is how we will make a legion worthy of bearing Lorgar‚Äôs word.‚Äù	40kFanfictions

I have the feeling BotW won't age well at all.	A new direction for the series, a beloved game of its time and innovative ideas but its sequel will be able to fix all the rough edges, build upon its foundation, has got more opportunity to focus on its content and flesh out the game-mechanics. The situation reminds me of GTA3. Such a beloved game in its time with a respectable metacritic score of 97. But when Vice City and especially San Andreas released and build upon its foundation there is no reason besides nostalgia to revisit this game. Nearly everything was done better now. Even the fans of this game realized it. Noone is talking about it anymore. I'm so hyped for BotW2. Because I see the *potential* in BotW.	truezelda

Early Entry Monday May 11, 2020	Reasons to Buy DG: ¬∑ Dollar General since it launched its IPO 12/31/2009 to today has only missed earnings twice in its ten-year stock market rise. The two earnings report days Dollar General was red but the next few days after continued its upwards trend as it absorbs the minor failures. o The two dates it missed its earnings are: 12/01/2016 and 03/14/2019 o üì∑üì∑8/30/2019 the day after earnings day Dollar General +/- by $27.88 in a day closing green near its day highs. üì∑ o üì∑üì∑03/21/2020 earnings day Dollar General +/- by $42.44 in a day closing green near its day highs.üì∑ ¬∑ MACD is trending upwards with signal lines indicating it will cross and it has a positive configuration at roughly 16.69-.18.33. ¬∑ Majority of analysts have a strong buy for short- and long-term forecasts ¬∑ Dollar General announced they will hire 50,000 more employees during the Corona Virus era to keep up with booming demand. ¬∑ Overall total volume of the options contracts is currently 3,284 as of this post. The Puts to call ratio: 1.3:1. However open interest has a call ratio of 1.02:1 signaling early entry position to ride the call train as Dollar General only increases over time and is deemed recession proof. ¬∑ Dollar General has profit margins greater than Walmart and Costco and by operating with fewer employees, overhead and selling brand named products at a cheaper rate in low income communities has helped stabilize the impacts of corona deeming it corona proof. ¬∑ DG entered an Uptrend as Momentum indicator exceeded the 0 level on May 8, 2020. Odds for DG making money is very high. ¬∑ Dollar General is a store that consists of cheaper goods than Walmart and Costco. In times of recessions or depressions, I predict the go to store will be Dollar General due to the majority of Americans being middle class to lower class with the majority of American having not even 2 months savings expenses in their accounts. ¬∑ How Does Dollar General Compare to top competitors? There isn‚Äôt even an equity summary score for how much DG is going to rise. Look at the price performance in 52 weeks. 2nd to target and no one else even coming close. PE ratio can be used to evaluate future earnings predictions and market cap. Does not count other factors and the P/E ratio is 2nd to Walmart. Dollar General is an under the radar option/stock play. With a Beta of .53, Market movements doesn‚Äôt effect it that much due to the fact this Dollar General is Corona proof. üì∑ Dollar General is not also worried about supply chain issues per CEO of Dollar General: üì∑ Some Key Stats About $DG and its industry valuation: üì∑ üì∑ Reasons Skeptics say not to buy: ¬∑ ‚Äúits at all time highs‚Äù ¬∑ ‚Äúits overbought RSI is at 82‚Äù ¬∑ ‚ÄúWhat's Dollar General?‚Äù Here‚Äôs some links and TA: The DG Uptrend Momentum Indicator: [https://twitter.com/Tickeron/status/1259071349223378945](https://twitter.com/Tickeron/status/1259071349223378945) Dollar General Margin Vs Walmart and Costco Margin [https://twitter.com/MazwoodCap/status/1258848619022647303](https://twitter.com/MazwoodCap/status/1258848619022647303) üì∑üì∑ üì∑ üì∑ TLDR: $DG is the new Walmart, the new Target craze from 2019 has shifted to the Dollar General Spaceship of 2020.

Update: 47 Year old got my first console HOLY FUCK	Here is my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/g3vmiw/47yo_got_my_first_game_console_holy_fuck/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share Wanted to let you all know I finished Jedi: Fallen Order and wow, what a fucking awesome ride! It was an emotional rollercoaster for me playing this damn game! Some things I observed: -My concern I would play it obsessively didn't pan out, I could play for 20-30 minutes and it was just so stimulating I'd have to put it down. I probably play it on average an hour to two hours a day. I used it as a reward for getting stuff done I didn't want to do like cleaning/paperwork. -Learning how to use a controllers buttons is HARD. Maddening at times! I have like so much more respect for people who play these games well. Before doing this I didn't realize how much skill is involved, the eye/ hand coordination is absolutely amazing. I've watched many videos of people playing the game online, and was baffled on how they could possibly play so well. I would often swear that my controller was defective and wasn't responding as quickly as it should be. -My dogs eventually got used to my yelling and didn't give a shit, just kept sleeping through it. - I had moments of pure joy, jumping up in my living room like a happy little kid, to moments of being a spoiled little brat who couldn't play well and wanting to literally break the controller. - These games can be really good for working on yourself emotionally. I'm a mental health therapist and can see how these games can improve people's mental health if they apply basic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques. And like any hobby, for some it can potentially be detrimental. The one thing I had to keep reminding myself is I'm new at this, it takes practice, not expecting myself to be awesome at it immediately. That really help me stay focused and enjoying the game. - Confession, I played the last two bosses in story mode. I was able to beat all the other bosses, and the first time I did it felt awesome, the second time was cool, but the third time it just got old for me playing over and over and over again the same thing. I actually didn't play for 3 days because I was loathing having to fight this boss, I just didn't want fight it over and over and over again. So I made the decision to just be easy on myself in order to enjoy the game. I thought I'd regret it, but I don't. I know with time I'll get better at playing these games and probably won't have to resort to that. But for now I'm cool with my choice. Once again want to thank you all for the previous support, I'm about to start playing Red Dead Redemption 2. Wish me luck!	xboxone

Interview Resources for Data Scientists	Hey guys, this is my first time posting on this subreddit despite following it for months. I feel like with all of the help that I have received from this subreddit, I must contribute to it as well. I figured that most of the people that are learning machine learning are doing it to get a job so what's better than giving them a list of resources which they can play around with and hopefully get a job of their dreams. Since I am a hyper-resource focused person, I believe that the resources I have curated can help you guys a lot. Resource #1: [https://www.interviewquery.com/](https://www.interviewquery.com/) . Personally, I love this website and their blog which has podcasts with real Data Scientists and interview guides for well-known companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Walmart, Nvidia. I have signed up for their free problem every week and I have gotten to know what kind of interview questions I can expect. If you are looking for a job in the future or a in kind of a job/interview crunch right now, they have all of the resources to help you succeed. Resource #2: [https://www.datasciencedreamjob.com](https://www.datasciencedreamjob.com/blog). This is actually a platform that has a course and a mentoring program which could be beneficial to students/new grads. However, if you are a software engineer or someone with a considerable background in machine learning or statistics then it is not that useful. However, I would highly recommend this to any new grad/student who is looking to gain DS skills and then use [https://www.interviewquery.com/](https://www.interviewquery.com/) for interview practice. Resource #3: [https://datascienceprep.com/](https://datascienceprep.com/) . This is actually similar to InterviewQuery, albeit a bit subpar, as they are a bit statistics/math focused so if you feel like revising those pesky probability formulas or probability distributions then this would help. With regards to their blog, I would say that it not one of the best as it focuses on obsure analyses and doesn't help with interviewing but their questions can provide value. If you are someone who has trouble with the math part of machine learning then this resource would be helpful. Resource #4: [https://www.interviewqs.com/](https://www.interviewqs.com/) . This is also a interview prep site that is quite help. It is similar to [datascienceprep.com](https://datascienceprep.com) but it also has a focus on SQL which is a major part of DS interviews. After reading hundreds of DS tutorials, I have found their blog to be a amalgamation of these standard, introductory analyses which can be jarring to a lot of people. So, if you choose this resource then please use it for Interview questions only. Personally, I feel like InterviewQuery is more helpful as it offers mentorship through it's talks/podcasts which anyone can listen to in their free time and their interviewing guides targeted to specific companies (I have linked a few of them at the bottom). Personally, I believe that learning the fundamentals is key and so if you are a student, you should probably look at CS229's lectures from Stanford on Youtube or [Fast.ai](https://Fast.ai). I believe that with rapid progress in DS, it is a viable career option but areas like Neural Architecture Search might make it infeasible in the future by designing neural networks which can design other neural nets. Scary stuff, I know! As promised, here a few company guides from Interview Query and you guys can check out the rest of them on their blog. [https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-snapchat-data-science-interview-questions-and-tips/](https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-snapchat-data-science-interview-questions-and-tips/) [https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-the-google-data-scientist-interview/](https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-the-google-data-scientist-interview/) [https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-amazon-machine-learning-interview-questions-solutions/](https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-amazon-machine-learning-interview-questions-solutions/) [https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-nvidia-data-science-interview/](https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-nvidia-data-science-interview/) If you guys have any thoughts or comments, feel free to post them as I will respond to every single one of them. I also have a few other resources and I will be happy to share them in the comments (since it is quite late and I need to get off reddit into the real world).	learnmachinelearning

What Failure Entails - Claude's Fate in Non-Verdant Wind routes	"**Spoilers for all routes in Three Houses** Since the release of the DLC, more information has come out for Claude and I think most, if not all of it, refutes a common perception of what happens to him at the end of Crimson Flower (if he is spared), Azure Moon, and Silver Snow. Therefore, today, I will be diving into an analysis about Claude's fate in non-Verdant Wind routes. I will be looking at both the English and Japanese version of Three Houses a bit because I think the Japanese dialogue can sometimes show a new perspective. For each section that look at both in, I will specify in parentheses which version of the game I am referencing. ""English"" means that is the official English localization, ""Japanese"" means that is the Japanese version, and ""Translation"" means it is a direct, unofficial translation. Translations will always be as direct as possible. They will not be fancy by extension and might even have awkward flow because it is trying to keep the nuance of the original Japanese in mind. Anyway, let us begin ‚Äì Claude's father is the King of Almyra as mentioned by several of his endings (Annette and Ingrid), but many lines suggest that Claude is not necessarily heir to the throne. Claude says that following in S-support with Byleth: >Claude (English): ""Now I've got to use my other bloodline to change my homeland for the better. *I have royal connections there too, insignificant as they may be.* It's time for me to struggle all over again and see what good I can do."" >Claude (Japanese): ""Âêë„Åì„ÅÜ„Åò„ÇÉ‰ø∫„ÇÇÁéãÊóè„ÅÆÁ´Ø„Åè„Çå„Å™„Çì„Åß„Çå„ÄÇ„Åì„ÅÆË°Ä„ÇíÂà©Áî®„Åó„ÄÅ„Åæ„ÅüË∂≥Êéª„ÅÑ„Å¶„Åø„Çã„Çà„ÄÇ"" In Japanese, I think the implications of what Claude is saying comes off stronger. He uses ""ÁéãÊóè„ÅÆÁ´Ø„Åè„Çå"" to describe his position in Almyra and this translates to ""borderline royal"" (I have seen it translated to ""insignificant part of the royal family"" as well, but I believe ""borderline royal"" is probably most direct) and it implies that he is not an important part of the Almyran royal family. A recent [Nintendo DREAM interview](https://nintendoeverything.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-interview-part-2-byleth-dimitri-eyepatch/3/) also supports that interpretation by mentioning that Claude likely has many half-siblings that hated and bullied him. In other words, while Claude is Almyran royalty and can claim the throne, I believe he is in competition with his half-siblings and he is not guaranteed to get it. In fact, the reason that Claude is able to become King of Almyra in Verdant Wind is because he accomplished something substantial ‚Äì united Fodlan ‚Äì and demonstrated strength and growth. Claude's ending card with several characters like Hilda, Annette, and Ingrid support this interpretation: >Hilda: ""Entrusting the future of Fodlan to his friends, Claude left for Almyra to take his place as heir to the throne. *His family saw that he had grown strong and allowed him to claim his birthright.*"" >Annette: ""Entrusting the future of Fodlan to his friends, Claude left for Almyra with Annette, whom he intended to marry. He announced this fact to his father, the king of Almyra, who *approved of Claude's growth* and Annette's wisdom and resolved to entrust the monarchy to them."" >Ingrid: ""Entrusting the future of Fodlan to his friends, Claude left for Almyra with Ingrid, whom he intended to marry. He announced this fact to his father, the king of Almyra, who *approved of Claude's strength* and Ingrid's virtue and resolved to entrust the monarchy to them."" In non-Verdant Wind routes, Claude returns to Almyra without achieving anything. This makes his chances of becoming King of Almyra dubious. I do not doubt that Claude will always be trying to find a way to carve out a place where he belongs, but that desire can only get him so far. This is especially so after a telling piece of dialogue in regards to Claude's fate in non-Verdant Wind routes was added in with the DLC. During chapter 15 of Crimson Flower and chapter 20 of Azure Moon, a suspicious man appears in the Abyss monastery segment. When spoken to, these are his lines of dialogue: >Suspicious Man (Japanese): ""ÂêåÁõü„ÅåËß£Êï£ÔºüÁõü‰∏ª„ÅØÂßø„ÇíÊ∂à„Åó„Åü„Å£„Å¶Ôºü‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‰ø∫„ÅÆÂΩπÁõÆ„ÇÇÁµÇ„Çè„Çä„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åì„Å®„Åã„ÄÇ„ÉÅ„ÉÉ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶„ÅÇ„ÅÆÁéãÂ≠ê„ÇÅ„ÄÇ„Åæ„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÄÅ„Åæ„ÅüÊù•„ÇãÊ©ü‰ºö„ÅØ„ÅÇ„Çã„Åã„ÇÇ„Åó„Çå„Çì„ÄÇ‰ªäÂ∫¶„ÅØÈ£õÁ´ú„Å´‰πó„Å£„Å¶„ÄÅÂ†Ç„ÄÖ„Å®„Å™„ÄÇ"" >Suspicious Man (English): ""So the Alliance is finished, is it? The leader's gone? That damn prince. Seems my role here is at an end. No matter. Should another chance present itself, I'll take a less subtle route..."" >Suspicious Man (Translated): ""The Alliance disbanded? The leader has disappeared? ...It seems my role here is already at an end. That damn prince. No matter, another opportunity might present itself. Perhaps next time I'll be more grand riding a wyvern."" This suspicious man dons [assassin class clothing](https://imgur.com/a/AOmeZbj) so it is safe to assume that he is tasked to assassinate someone. His words are quite vague in the English localization; however, in Japanese, his last sentence translates literally to ""perhaps next time I'll be more grand riding a wyvern."" As such, the Japanese dialogue makes it very clear that this assassin is Almyran since Almyra is known for its warriors that ride upon the backs of wyverns. And the fact that he views this action as ""Â†Ç„ÄÖ"" or ""grand,"" also reinforces that idea because riding a wyvern is specifically a [rite of passage](https://imgur.com/a/7oMba4O) in Almyra. In Japanese, he also clearly conveys contempt towards the ""prince"" he is talking about due to the usage of ""„ÇÅ"" right after ""ÁéãÂ≠ê."" Therefore, it is safe to deduce that he is trying to kill this prince. At this point in Azure Moon's story, Dimitri is no longer prince of Faerghus ‚Äì he became king after chapter 18 in Azure Moon. Additionally, in the context of Crimson Flower, it makes no sense for the assassin to talk about the Alliance and Claude before switching to Dimitri without some kind of bridging thought. Thus, the assassin can only be talking about Claude (since Claude is an Almyran prince). Therefore, if Claude is not killed on non-Verdant Wind routes, this NPC gives an idea of what will likely happen to him when he returns to Almyra. Claude has spoken briefly about being targeted by assassins in his B-support with Byleth and the threat of an assassin has likely always lurked in the back of his mind (how Shamir and Claude's C-support opens up leads me to believe Claude was initially scared that an assassin had followed him to Fodlan), but the mere existence of this suspicious man plays with the idea that Claude will be killed when he returns to Almyra in non-Verdant Wind routes or at the very least, show that Claude will face strife later on his life (after all, the NPC must have been added for a reason). There are a few caveats in regards to this suspicious man, however. For one, he does not appear in Silver Snow. I think this can be explained by how the developers simply copy-and-pasted Verdant Wind's Abyss monastery dialogue on to Silver Snow without second thoughts. This is reinforced by the fact that in chapter 16 of Silver Snow, Constance says ""[...] I fear that to proceed will be to abandon all hope of restoring the Imperial House of Nuvelle. Which leaves me with no choice but to appeal to you and Claude for that. My dream is in your hands"" even though Claude does not appear in Silver Snow at all. Additionally, this assassin still appears and his dialogue does not change if Claude is killed in Crimson Flower. Once again, I believe this is an oversight due to the sloppy implementation of the DLC. The assassin's first two sentences are unequivocally about Claude but they do not make sense if Claude is killed because he could not have ""disappeared."" And as established earlier, it makes no sense for the assassin to talk about Dimitri in this context in Crimson Flower. The only prince he could be talking about is Claude; however, the developers seemed to have forgotten to remove the NPC or change things if Claude was killed the chapter prior. Unless another interpretation of this dialogue can be pieced together, I believe the intent was to show that either Claude will eventually be killed upon returning to Almyra or show that he will be facing a lot of strife back in his homeland in non-Verdant Wind routes. This unfavorable fate also ties into themes that revolve around Claude as well as major flaws of his character. Claude has had his circumstances at birth constantly define him. Being born from a mother of Fodlan descent lead to him being hated for his lineage in Almyra. And entering Fodlan with no word of his existence beforehand meant being suspicious or untrustworthy. He was either treated with contempt or as an outsider before doing anything to warrant those reactions. But on the flip-side, all his connections are also born from his circumstances, namely his status. As Almyran royalty, Claude got connections to Nader, an Almyran general. And as heir to House Riegan, he has connections to Judith and his grandfather, Oswald. None of these connections are things that Claude did anything for either. Ultimately, even though Claude's background made his environment hostile towards him, he is privileged in several ways as well. Claude's privilege is a huge character flaw of his that blinds him to the suffering of others and it deserves its own thorough analysis so I will not ramble about it here; however, it is important to note that it exists because it runs in parallel with Claude's overt opposition to xenophobia. Claude wants to be accepted for who he really is and what he has achieved, not what he was born with. A guaranteed ascension to Almyra's throne would dull this thematically. But despite his dreaming, the Claude in non-Verdant Wind routes does not have what it takes to realize his lofty ambition. That is because one of Claude's key character flaws is his rationality. His rationality makes him unable to take feelings ‚Äì the feelings of other people as well as his own ‚Äì into account. In Crimson Flower and Azure Moon, Judith at the very minimum is always willing to die for Claude. But Claude does not understand why Judith will go to such lengths for him. Hilda is a much more notable example that occurs in Crimson Flower (but she can be recruited in Azure Moon so that is why she is a footnote here). In non-Verdant Wind routes, Claude is purely pragmatic. It's why he can survive Fodlan's war ‚Äì instead of pushing his chances, he backs out when the odds turn sour. But the thing is, that rationality clashes hard with his idealistic dreams. And in the end, Claude locks away his own feelings in exchange for survival. This interpretation is once again supported by the [Nintendo DREAM Interview](https://nintendoeverything.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-interview-part-2-byleth-dimitri-eyepatch/3/) which states that Claude has different values than those from Fodlan and how he believes survival is equivalent to victory. **Conclusion/TL;DR** In conclusion, the newly added DLC dialogue, the insight provided in the recent Nintendo DREAM interview, and the in-game endings and themes all suggest that Claude will *not* claim the Almyran throne in non-Verdant Wind routes. In Crimson Flower and Azure Moon, Claude's final fate is heavily implied to be a road filled with strife or even his own death. It is tougher to discern whether or not he will become King of Almyra in Silver Snow due to the absence of the DLC assassin on that route (which might have been unintentional, but nonetheless, the assassin does not exist in the route); however, with Claude's noticeable lack of accomplishments in Silver Snow, he offers little to garner his father's approval. And even if Claude is able to become King of Almyra, his shortcomings in non-Verdant Wind routes ‚Äì namely his rationality, ignorance, and reliance on using others ‚Äì will likely prevent him from finding the true acceptance he seeks. I want to end on a huge thank you to u/simplegrocery3 and u/cyrismustang for verifying and/or translating the Japanese portions I wrote about! This essay would not have been possible without their help since I am self-taught in the language and learning. u/cyrismustang has also been [translating the entirety of Three Houses's main story as a personal project](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/elhi7z/three_houses_fan_translation_prologue_personal/) so please take a look if you're interested in the differences between the English and Japanese dialogue of Three Houses. And also a huge thank you to u/Thanni44 for bringing the DLC dialogue to my attention and discussing with me!"	fireemblem
Last Roll20 session was amazing!	So ever since the pandemic started our little DnD group has moved our sessions to Roll20 and I took over as DM. I was extremely worried how it would go not being in person with our friends. I've been writing a Homebrew campaign for about 6 months and several Sundays ago we officially launched my campaign. I'm extremely proud to say that last night after hitting level 4, my players spent the entire day interacting with NPCs, exploring a port town I created, and generally just having fun and roleplaying (without complaining about no combat at all). At the end of the session one of my players said that it was an awesome session and she can't wait to play next Sunday!! I'm so happy my players like what I've worked so hard on. I know hardly anyone will see this but I had to tell someone!	DnD
How I became a cuckold	Well my story is that my girlfriend wanted to watch me suck another man's cock. She told me it made her so hot and horny to think about it. So I confessed that I've sucked a friends cock before and would be willing to please her. So we found a guy willing and was really good size and my girlfriend started to kiss him and I got turned on from it. Before I knew it I was sucking his big cock and my girlfriend loved watching and she started fucking him and I loved it. Once done I was ordered to lick her clean and I loved it so much. We did for few years with different guys	cuckoldstories

A love letter to the HP 6200 Pro (SFF)	Over the past year I've been experimenting with my home setup, including running a Dell R710. However, my favourite piece of hardware on my network by a wide margin is my HP 6200 Pro (sff). These seem to have been in wide circulation in colleges and universities, and there are a ton of them out there. Mine came with an i3 and 4GB of RAM, and I bumped it fairly cheaply to an i5 and 8GB, and I've been pretty thrilled with the performance considering the price. In Canada we have significantly less choice and we pay significantly more (for example, you frequently see the R710 for sale in the US around $100 USD, the cheapest you can find it here is around $250 CAD, and you still might have to purchase caddies). But the 6200 Pro cost me $75 CAD, it holds 3 drives easily (assuming you're willing to swap out the optical drive) and it's cheap and quiet. If you can live without the redundancy provided by enterprise grade hardware, I'd recommend these boxes wholeheartedly!	homelab

Weird phenomenon when looking at white screen, looks like a wormhole	"Probably nothing problematic but out of curiosity I'm wondering if this is an actual thing? I've tried googling but no success. Anyway sometimes when looking at a white screen on my computer all of a sudden at the center of my vision I get this weird wormwhole effect. Not sure how to describe it. The closest image I've been able to find of what it looks like is this: https://media.giphy.com/media/26ufaKwBoqwQItgic/giphy.gif But it's not still, it's moving like in the gif. And there's no color, it's just slightly dark. And there's not really a center ""dot"" like in the gif. As in, I don't see a solid black center. It's all wormhole-y to the very end."	optometry
All Umineko Characters are severely flawed and self contained tragedies/external tragedies. And Thats a good thing.	"Like how Eva grew so bitter under the shadow of being a woman - cast by not only sexism but also cast by her father. How strongly she wished things couldve been different or that she was born a man. Then she goes into life trying to ""prove herself"" and does not see that the same thing she is doing now --- her son would wish she would stop and accept him for who he is instead of trying to perfect him. And being sexist toward him as well, ""Because he is male. He will be the perfect heir."". The parents -- siblings are mostly tied in a chain of pain. ""Kinzo did this to me. Now I do it to you."" and so each sibling passes it on, eventually one way or the other poisoning everyone. Not only does each character have an ""external tragedy"" but also an ""internal tragedy"". One caused by events outside of their control --- like Eva and all the rumors of the rokkenjima massacre , but also internal conflicts they are oblivious to -- which cause them much distress. I always remember the umineko characters just because of how ""human"" they are in terms of how externally and internally flawed they are -- unlike some other typical ""modern"" anime characters. In a sense the characters remind me of Evangelion in a sense of how they could make you laugh until you realized how not all the characters together could form one ""whole person"" -- in terms of what they lacked or how fragmented they were -- and that in that is to be human, [in umineko] they arent happy in the end because they ""resolve"" these problems but more because they become aware of them and allow themselves to forgive each other and their own selves. Like how when Meta Beatrice sees Kinzo crying at the painting -- screaming for her to appear and smile at him once more. And she looks at him and says ""Kinzo, you fool. You cannot see that I am right here."" - Signaling that Kinzo's solution to his woe do not lie in some arcane ritual but in the ability to grant himself forgiveness for his sins and move forward. His tragedy is not only external, but largely internal. He wants Beatrice (and Beatrice 2.0) to forgive him, but that wouldnt matter if he cant forgive himself. Not all problems in life will be solved. But there is no need to carry that excessive burden forever. Theres no ""fix"" to a lot of the problems in the novel or a ""villain"" to defeat other than their own interal conflicts and misconceptions -- other than acceptance and forgiveness. Thats a beautiful message."	umineko

Wanted to thank some of you specifically for your help on my previous post about negativity at work.	"Posted asking for advice on how to handle negativity when returning to work. I've reflected on and incorporated what was suggested to me. I've realized that everyone is the way they are because of their own reasons (simple, right? I had never looked at it this way though), just as I am the way I am because of my own reasons. Realizing people respond the best they know how, whether that has been shaped by past experiences, big life stresses, the people they are around, whatever factors, has allowed me to listen to others more empathetically, pause to see my first internal reaction, and change how I respond to them (or not, as some suggested it can be best to just not reply or give a passive ""Mmm""). I find myself calmer and less physically tense. I respond instead of react and reframe it in my head. I've learned to reframe a lot of how I see work in general actually. This stuff is so cool, man! Anyway, I wanted to especially thank u/Phantombaz u/StealYourHotspur and u/Strawberry_Sweet. You guys told me things I really needed to hear, gave me a new perspective and tools to use. You've made things much clearer for me. There's a huge difference between how scared and walking-on-eggshells I felt around a lot of my co-workers, to how I feel more in control of myself and reactions to them, in turn feeling a *lot* more confident.

Faction-specific healing/revive particle effects?	I've noticed this a lot recently when watching some of the event twitch streams etc., but its also something that became apparent with the surge of recent content creator videos: **all healing effects are green**. For the sake of brevity - why?: * Green doesn't always align well with the factions from an immersion/art perspective * It makes for a bad distinction of friend vs. foe, especially during rezwars and/or if smoke is involved (is that an enemy resnade/healing nade?) **Proposal: Make all healing/revive particle effects faction-specific.** * this is already the case for shield bubbles (could be further emphasized for e.g. VS being more purple vs. NC), and it was done for the frag grenades * AOE heal, heal grenade/ revive nade etc. should follow the factions: red for TR, blue for NC, purple for VS * Optionally (don't know if feasible): The particle effects could follow the empire color settings the player uses instead (i.e. for those weirdos that play TR with blue friendly icons) *** Its a small QOL feature request, but I think it would add a lot for the distinction of the effects (gameplay, casting/commenting), and also add to the faction flavors. Sidenote: possibly smoke and/or flash effects could be faction-colored, too (so you know whom to thank/blame, and for smoke it may mask doritos a bit when spotted within).	Planetside

I just experienced the worst thing while hosting a catalogue party	My friend and I were hosting our first ever catalogue party through turnip exchange at my island. Things were going swimmingly, and everyone was so polite. It started going downhill when someone didn‚Äôt follow the rules I set out, and began taking everyone‚Äôs furniture without putting them down. I repeatedly typed out, ‚Äòdrop the items‚Äô but that person would not listen and began taking the free furniture and DIY‚Äôs I laid out too. My friend and I tried to block the bridge so she couldn‚Äôt leave, but this BLOODY TROLL WHIPPED HER BLOODY POLE OUT and was about to jump over the river to leave (I know, I should‚Äôve fenced the river). I quickly apologised to everyone and ended the session right there. I‚Äôm beyond angry and disappointed with what just happened. Thinking back on it now, I should‚Äôve just forced shutdown my switch or closed the game entirely. That would have probably made the game not save, and the other people could still have their furniture with them. This whole situation has just put me off and I probably won‚Äôt be hosting something like this again. This is my warning to you all. Please be careful when hosting something similar to this. If you‚Äôre using turnip exchange, maybe end the session when an unknown person that is not in queue, rocks up to your island. Another thing maybe, is to have people mention their in-game name so you know who‚Äôs travelling to your island. Please don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. I feel incredibly guilty to the three other people that got their furniture stolen. Suffice to say, I‚Äôve learnt my lesson.	ac_newhorizons
making Narwhale better	"As most people can see there are a lot of players being in teams, especially on the European server. This really doesn't matter for me. Where i care about is the contact between this people. It would be a nice idea to somehow put a chat in this game. To be more clear, a chat as in the left corner down of the screen like as in the game ""Gota.io"" . Or try something new like you can actually click on a Narwhale select ""message"" and a little chat opens where you can message the player. I have never edited a game before so i wouldn't know how to do that but it doesn't seem impossible to me. The reason of this idea is to make better contact with other players where you can actually talk with if you don't want to give them any other social media for your own safety. This will make people more interested in the game. Wich means more people will play it and more people will play it for a longer time because they are able to actually communicate. I have seen a lot of people trying to communicate with only their space for their nickname and it's not really convenient. Also i'd like a Narwhale mod to add more skins and make the space for their nickname bigger. Because with the skins, nickname + clan tag people really make them self original works of art and it's really pretty to see all this created names with their matching or not matching skins. I have done it too for sure. But to keep the players happy i'd like more time of skins. An example, in the game are 2 skins where they have worked with invisibility (showing the background). i'd really like some more of those but with other patterns. For example, a spiral, stripes, Little waves,... It's really hard to explain but the ideas aren't that bad and it will make more people interested in playing this game. Peace."	Narwhale_io

I'm not good also of using EDagons because I don't really like using them. I am more of a ground troop attacker. There are times I use air troops when funneling or as a clean up Troop. BBD's are my favorite. I don't mind if there are suggestions that you can provide here with DE troops. Most of the time I used IG, WITCH, YETI/BOWLERS. I do QC or WARDEN walk depends on the enemy base. Also, I want to push to Legend League as well but that will come later. I see a lot of videos including YETI smash/PEKKA smash at TH13 and I've been practicing them too. But I want some suggestions from you guys. Thanks	ClashOfClans

Guides to setting up a Server so play with my son and his friends.	Hello everyone, Through some googling It seems there are many ways a server can be set up for Minecraft. But I'm not clear about what is the best way and was hoping for some advice and links. &#x200B; My 10yr old son plays Minecraft with 3-4 classmates regularly on Xbox One. I played minecraft for all of 10 minutes to show him the ropes of using the controller and never looked at it again. I've been thinking I want to make a world, I'll spend a few months playing in said world to build up some skill and make some neat things, then have my son and his friends join. I would be playing from a Win 10 PC, they play via Xbox One. What is the best course of action to building a world, hosting said world and allowing his friends to join where I eat all the costs so that no subscriptions or anything are needed by the other families?

2 years of restoration	Today I realized that I started restoring in January of 2018. I have had a pretty consistent restoration practice during that time. There were a few months in that time span where I dropped the ball but as a whole it has been consistent tugging for at least 4 hours a day or more with the TLC tugger. With all my efforts, I have not reached the point of roll over yet. There is a lot more slack in my skin and I can masturbate without using lubricant, which is awesome! I did however think I would be further along by this point. I have folded in some manual methods in addition the wearing the TLC tugger just to give the skin a different stretch. Any other advice from any seasoned restorers would be much appreciated.	foreskin_restoration

Interesting uses for Exhaustion	Having watched Zee Bashews brilliant episode on Exhaustion, I've been wondering about cool, dramatic ways of using it. I was thinking if a spell caster ran out of spell slots, they might be able to continue casting, taking a level of exhaustion for each level of the spell This would be dangerous and dramatic as they slowly wear themselves down, only using spells where the stakes are high enough, fighting the lich or healing an ally What other homebrew mechanics could there be for exhaustion?

Tips on Recovering from a Binge Sesh & Associated Shame/ Disappointment?	I‚Äôve been great about sticking to calorie limits (1750) for the first time in my life. Made it to about 5 weeks, and posted on r/progresspics (my main motivation), but deleted my post with the progress I was so proud of after receiving too many sexual DMs. Since then, I‚Äôve felt very low energy (‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù), have been oversleeping and had 3 days where I massively oversnacked (with an extra 2000+ calories). Does anyone have tips for renewing hope and motivation? I was so excited to watch the numbers on my scale go down, and now it all feels so out of reach/ pointless when I can wreck it all as easily as running to the store and eating too big a bag of chips. And it sucks to not be able to share my progress. Being sexualized for normal pics of my body just makes me want to hide my body and never show off my progress again.	loseit

You would click on the gold plated event and it will bring you to the challenges for every gun, you would click on the weapon that you want in gold, and it will bring you to 25 challenges, these challenges may vary from 25 headshots, to 100 kills with no attachments.

"A thought on ""Karen"" and customer service"	"I used to be in the service industry, and it was hell on earth. I would hate, hate, HATE to ever be in it again. Customers can be really callous and cruel. Sadistic, even. But...... I have to admit, the phenomenon of getting lesser service based on who you are is also very real. If it's not, then white male privilege doesn't exist, and SJWs need to drop it already. It's well known that women get screwed in negotiations with salespeople, and people of color are treated like garbage even though they are paying the same ticket price as everyone else. So.....question. Is the ""Karen"" meme really more about rage against middle-aged women who dare to speak up for themselves? And their whiteness is the straw man? My elderly grandmother once sat in a doctor's waiting room for TWO HOURS when it was empty, because she was too afraid of annoying the snappish receptionist. This receptionist wouldn't have been so snappish with a man, and in fact, she would have proactively never let it get that far. So my dad called and complained. My grandmother was injured and to allow her to suffer when the office was empty was inexcusable. He was in another state, hundreds of miles away, but boy were they ever apologetic. Because of class dynamics, people can be awful to minimum wage workers. I know this firsthand. Likewise, service industry people don't have some magical immunity to misogyny, racism, ableism, or bigotry. How many disabled people have ordered an Uber only to be stood up at the last minute because the driver doesn't want to put a wheel chair in the trunk? How many black women have waited a ridiculous amount of time in a yarn store for service? How many middle aged women get ignored in a bar? So before we default to ""Karen"" let's leave room for the possibility that sometimes bigotry dynamics come from the service person, too."	GenderCritical

I am very patient and caring and love to hear about your day and get little pictures and drawing or colorings and crafts that you‚Äôve taken and made just for me. I am pretty strict when I need to be and have a healthy list of kinks if that‚Äôs where we end up taking it. I have had nonsexual Ddlg relationships and there is nothing wrong with that as long as we are both on the same page and understand limits. I am open to any age, race, or body type. If we connect we connect period. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I do have a type. But mostly my type is someone who I can mentally connect with and who is cute, bubbly and caring. I do have kik but we can talk on here until we are comfortable enough to move on to a different platform. Please don‚Äôt be shy and say hi I‚Äôd love to hear from you ‚ò∫Ô∏è	DDLGPersonals
Cutom QMK macropad with encoder	Hi everyone, I have used the search function, but I couldn't find a comprehensive guide on the matter. I would like to start dipping my toes in the QMK world by making a custom macropad. The first problem that I encountered is that there is some documentation for setting up qmk for a standard macro pad, but I coulnd't find much about the implementation of a rotary encoder. I mean, I see some people have done something, but I couldn't understand the process. Another thing I cannot wrap my head around is how I start from a custom layout on the qmk configurator. Layout that I have created on the online keyboard layout editor for example. I would like to start from a layout not included in the options because in the future I might use this for a custom keyboard and would like to explore the worst case right now even if not strictly necessary. Also, how should I wire the enconder into the switch matrix?	olkb

M4F - Turn your scrawny, awkward roommate (me) into your ideal hung, muscular fucktoy	"Before I lay out the scenario, let me say I'm not married to the ""roommate"" angle. I'm fine with siblings, friends, whatever. I'm just using roommate as an example. I'd be more than happy to discuss other set-ups. This prompt is a re-working of [another of my prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ctoye1/m4f_after_plenty_of_physical_selfimprovement_the/). But where that one takes place after the change, this scenario can focus on the change. ------------------------------------- You and I were friends all through high school. You had your group of friends, but I was a weird, shy, awkward nerd. I didn't have many friends, and as such, I was always eager to agree and adjust my schedule and plans to fit yours. When it came time to pick universities, you and I wound up opting to go to the same one. The dorms there were exorbitant, so to save money, you and I decided to get an apartment together. Once in college, you find yourself going through something of a dry spell. It's getting frustrating, and you're not quite sure what to do. It doesn't help that you've got very high standards and a very specific type. That's when you get your idea. I just sit in my room all day, not really doing anything. You know I've never had any luck with girls, and you know I'll do pretty much anything you say. From here, I could see this going a few ways. * You're up front with me. You tell me it's too much of a hassle finding guys, and you'd be willing to sleep with me as long as I do exactly what you say. I need to start going to the gym and lifting weights. You watch my diet very carefully. You get me some penis-enlargement pills/exercises. * You could do this in secret, perhaps with some sort of miracle drug/magic/something. I'm open to solutions. Where it goes from here, I'm open to ideas. You could use me as you please. Maybe you could pimp me out to your friends or have me put on camshows for a profit. I'd love to discuss other potential scenarios. General likes (not an exhaustive list, and not all need to be included): Big (fake?) tits, big ass, cock worship, public/semi-public/showing off, growth/transformation, exhibitionism, sharing, teasing, titfucking, slice of life, cuckolding General dislikes: Toilet stuff, blood, force/noncon, animals"	TransformationRP

Considering the large populations of people in bonds through the transatlantic slave trade, Helot population of Sparta,the captured parties of the Arabian Slave Trade, and the slaves of the Roman empire.

If i stop taking hrt for 4 month will i ruin my transition??	"Really hoping to have biological kids one day but i didn't freeze sperm when i had the chance. i want to stop taking HRT for a few months to attempt it. Im approaching 2 years in HRT at age 30. Do currently pass mostly, have developed pretty decently so far, im very active and eat well for the most part. My worry is that stopping for that long will ruin the long term effects and i wont fully develop and feminize properly once i get back on HRT. Being 30 i need every advantage i can get. Feel like i have to choose between kids and my true self. Ive heard of the ""ticking clock"" where once you start second puberty it only lasts for so long and the clock keeps ticking even if you stop hrt, so stopping for 4 months is very negative. Idk what to do atm, please share your thoughts and resources."	asktransgender

Or should production be more mindful of these issues and ensure that if there's a chance for said matchup that the elimination not be such a physical one? Is this not a massive issue? For an analogy, the UFC is forbidden to put two fighters in that are separated by too many spots in their ranking system. So the Lightweight champion can not face the 12th ranked guy, because that's putting someone in unnecessary danger when the outcome is obvious. It's not good entertainment, at that point. We saw that happen when Paul Felder was set to fight Khabib Nurmagamedov after Tony Ferguson dropped out and Paul was rejected because he was too low in the UFC's official rankings, so Al Iaquinta took the fight instead. That's not taking into account the weight classes, but there is a rule that no fighter is allowed to jump two weights classes, and there's an interesting rule at Heavyweight where the weight limit is simply less than 265 that says 40 pounds is the maximum difference for those fights. So a 215 pound Heavyweight can't fight a 265 pound Heavyweight, even though they're technically in the same weight class, the 215 would have to cut down to 205 and fight at Light Heavyweight. All in all, the nature of that elimination is part of what makes The Challenge so entertaining, but they did put someone's health at risk and I don't think that's worth the entertainment, personally. There's also something to be said for Rogan's complete disregard for Jay's wellbeing. For an example on this, we can look back to Leroy vs Cohutta doing the same elimination. Leroy did not wish to do physical harm to Cohutta, but it was still a rather one-sided afair. Not that it matters, but do you think Rogan is a decent enough human being to actually feel bad for what he did?	MtvChallenge
God Concept: Nephthys	So I was thinking about a god concept which has a true 'counter' in their kit. Obviously, there are gods that deal out reflect damage (such as Nemesis and Kuzenbo) that do a similar thing, but I'm referring to an ability that a) makes you immune to a single ability that would hit you if you had not countered, and b) has you return an actual attack those damage is proportional to the damage you would have been dealt. I wanted an ability that would truly feel like you outplayed whoever's attacking you. I then thought about how this synergises with the rest of their kit and how they can apply to the Egyptian goddess of rivers, the night and mourning, Nephthys (whose the sister-wife of Set, just as Isis is the sister-wife of Osiris). All of Geb and Nut's children are in the game besides her, so it'd be a good fit! She'll be an assassin (physical) as we haven't seen one in a while. She holds this weird staff thing that's honestly difficult to describe, but I imagine that she'll hold this as her weapon but with some sharper edges. I came up with the following kit: Passive (Changing Tides): Nephthys gain a percentage of the physical/magical power of the last god that she has hit and coverts it into physical power. (Doesn't scale off of level.) Obviously, this percentage will be different depending on whether the target is physical/magical as magical classes generally get more power. The idea of this passive is to establish Nephthys's role as a 'carry-killer' - a god that quickly turns the tables against a high-damaging god by using their power against them. (Remember the whole 'counter' theme I brought up earlier.) Ability 1 (Wave crash, cone): Nephthys uses a powerful wave to crash against an area in front of her, damaging enemies and knocking them up. Both the damage and the knockup duration decrease with the damage of the last attack dealt to Nephthys, down to a minimum amount of damage and knockup duration. This ability may seem confusing so let me clarify. This ability has a maximum amount of damage, which you deal if Nephthys hasn't taken any damage within the last, say, 4 seconds. But this ability loses damage depending on the last bit of damage dealt to Nephthys, and the amount lost is proportional to the amount of damage this last bit of damage was. The same goes for the knockup duration. What this means that, if a Nephthys is in your face, you want to quickly react by attacking her with your most damaging burst ability straight away. You don't want DOT damage against this ability, as the damage loss from this ability won't be very great. You may be able to see how this ability synergieses with this 'counter' I'm talking about. (If not, I shall explain later on!) Ability 2 (Water glide, dash): After selecting an enemy, Nephthys creates a surface of water between her and the enemy and uses it to dash towards them. She then slashes the targeted enemy with her staff. Nephthys also slashes at enemies during the dash and slows them. The damage the final slash deals increases with the number of enemy gods she attacked during his dash, up to a maximum of three. You might be able to see this is the classic 'backline dive' ability. I don't intend it to be particularly slow as I don't think interrupting this dash is the main counterplay against Nephthys (as shall be explained later). This ability is also tricky to use for mobility as you need an enemy to use it. It is more intended for an initiation tool, and the lack of disengage in this ability is made up for later on. Ability 3 (Funeral Passage, leap): Immediately after activating this ability, Nephthys assumes a stance that will block the next attack she's hit by. This stance will wear off after 2 seconds. If she is hit by an attack in this stance, she will unleash up to eight strikes on the enemy that used the attack and those around them, becoming immune for the duration. A certain amount of damage needs to be dealt to Nephthys by the blocked attack to execute the next strike. Now we get to the counter ability. As explained in the beginning, the idea of this ability is to a) become immune to the next ability that hits you after activation, and b) to deal an amount of damage that is proportional to the blocked attack. But I didn't want it to simply be an attack that has a higher damage number depending on the damage of the blocked attack - I wanted it to feel more tangible than that. This is where the whole 'up to eight strikes' comes in, where basically, the more damage you get dealt, the more attacks you get to deal back. Think of this like Fenrir's brutalise, if you were immune during Fenrir's brutalise and it could attack you up to eight times... yeah. This may seem OP at first sight, but keep in mind that Nephthys requires you to hit her with a big burst ability in order to gain maximum effectiveness with this ability. However, notice that, as a Nephthys player, this is **not** what you want in order to gain maximum effectiveness out of your first ability. This is where the crux of her whole kit comes into play. If a Nephthys is on you as the enemy (usually with her second ability), you have one of two options: 1. Don't attack her or at least use a low-damage attack like an auto. In this case, you are liable to taking a large amount of damage from her first ability but aren't at risk of the large burst damage from her counter. This decision has a low risk and a low reward (as the enemy that Nephthys is attacking). 2. Attack her with a high-damage burst ability. This is the high-risk but high-reward scenario. If you manage to hit her with the ability before she can counter, her first ability will do very little damage and be a very short knockup, and she also can't counter you unless you attack again. However, if Nephthys manages to counter you in time, you will have to bear the full brunt of her third ability and probably her first ability as well, as you would have taken so much damage at that point that you'd be running away and can't effectively nullify her first ability by dealing more damage to her. So you can see, scenario 1 allows Nephthys to benefit from her first ability and scenario 2 allows her to benefit from her third. I think this decision-making around what to do against a Nephthys not only creates interesting choices for the Nephthys player (do I counter expecting them to use a burst ability or do I use by first ability straight away instead?), but also for the enemy she's attacking (do I use a burst ability to nullify her first ability at risk of being countered by her third ability?). As a side-note, I think this ability should feel awesome once you do manage to get the right counter. In the ideal eight-attack combo scenario, she'll attack once from the left, then once from the right and then she'll jump above the enemy spin her staff above them five more times before coming down with the final slash (actually not to dissimilar to how Fenrir's brutalise works). Of course, if you don't block the maximum damage threshold with her and can only perform less than eight attacks, the animation will have to stop at the third or sixth attack, for example. Fourth ability (Spirit of Night, teleport): Nephthys teleports three times, becoming a spirit of night after the first two teleports that cannot use any attacks for 0.5 seconds. Nephthys is able to be hit during these times to cancel the ability. I think this is something unique for an assassin: an ultimate that doesn't do any damage! I thought that the rest of her kit is very 'all-in' as it stands, and needs some kind of disengage tool that she can lean to if her initial dive doesn't work out, making it appropriate here. However, this is still an ultimate ability so the cooldown means Nephthys players have to really assess the situation if they decide to go in without their ultimate. I also added some counter-play in the kit, as if you can hit her in between her teleports she's a sitting duck. I thought this was needed as it might be frustrating if a Nephthys player destroys your backline and gets away cleanly. Well there you go, that's her whole kit! There are probably a lot of problems hidden in there but I hope you get the general idea of what I intended with her kit.	Smite

21 [F4R] Canada	I‚Äôm currently a university student in Ontario in my undergrad with plans of pursuing a masters degree after. I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs open to a relationship, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable to go into something with a fixed end goal in mind. So, I would just like to get to know you and if we feel like it could be something we can talk about it. Ideally you‚Äôre close enough to meet up after. I have been single for a while, but woke up this morning missing closeness and security that comes with a relationship. I want something where we can both benefit from and continue to grow together. I love to cook, I absolutely adore trying to recreate something I‚Äôve tried while out and loved. I also love trying new recipes and taking what I‚Äôve liked from each and making the perfect version of something. Baking is usually where that happens. Cooking I‚Äôm far more loose with and sometimes it ends up incredible and others it‚Äôs just alright. I also love gardening, I love being able to eat fresh out of the garden but also see things you put effort into grow into something beautiful. I will always choose a potted rose plant over cut roses. I‚Äôm always going to take any excuse to be outside, i love staying active and want someone who does as well. I want someone who‚Äôs ready to go hiking or scale down a waterfall with me when we get a sunny day in the summer. I really like road tripping as well and picking day trips to explore different things, whether it‚Äôs the city or nature. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 if that matters. Physical attraction is also important for a relationship for me. And I‚Äôve been working out so consider it an investment, you‚Äôre only going to end up with better than you currently see üòÇ I‚Äôm looking for someone who I can joke around with and can also have more serious conversation with. I love hearing people talk about what they‚Äôre passionate about, and seeing them all excited. Ideally you are pursuing an education or you‚Äôve gotten one. I‚Äôve been finding it‚Äôs easier to talk longer term if that‚Äôs the case. Preferably you‚Äôre close in age as well. If you‚Äôre still reading, please send me a message, include your age and where you‚Äôre from. Also tell me what you‚Äôre missing the most about normal life.

[Guide] Neverland Casino Slots 2020 - Level 200 or 300	*This guide is based on the format used in multiple previous guides made by* [***u/Mikazah***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mikazah/) &#x200B; **Overview** The offer 'Neverland Casino Slots 2020' is based on an app for both Android and iOS that allows users to play slots with chips. The offer required me to reach level 300 in the app. The game is as stated in it's name, slots gameplay. This offer is quite easy to automate and you spend little time actually doing something in the app. &#x200B; Be aware there's two versions of this offer, one is to reach level 200 and one is to reach level 300. I did the 300 one and it took me roughly 72 hours, I believe it's possible to complete the level 200 one in less than 24 hours. &#x200B; Also be aware this guide is based on what I did to complete the offer, there might be other and better ways to optimize it further and I also can't guarantee this method will work for you as slots offers are somewhat random, based on what rewards you receive from cases, lucky wheels and other bonuses. And of course what you win from playing the slots will also factor in. &#x200B; **Details** |Offer name|Neverland Casino Slots 2020| |:-|:-| |Offerwalls|AdGem & AdGate Media| |OS|iOS & Android| |Countries that has the offer (that I'm aware of)|US, CA, UK, DE, SE, NO, AT, AU, ES, FR, IT, ZA, NL| |Amount|Depends on the site you use, offerwall, OS & country. **I got $15.75**| |Time Limit|12 Days on AdGem| |Time Spent|Hands on \~2 hours. \~72 Hours idle.| &#x200B; **How to play & Tips** Here's the exact recipe I suggest you follow based on my own experiences. Use an iPad/Tablet or a spare phone if possible, so you can leave it running constantly without interruption. &#x200B; The first thing to do when you jump into the game is to collect all the free chips you can, Facebook login and clicking links from their social media (didn't work for me, but I've heard others say it works for them). Also check if you've received any wCases (bottom bar) that you can open. After collecting all the free chips, start playing slots. Jump into one of the slots that offers auto-spin and don't require you to hit any button when you get free spins. Examples of these are 'Great Grizzly' and 'Temple of the Jaguar' when you get to a higher level. Also if you can, try to find out which slot has the lowest re-spin time as you want to make as many spins as possible within the least time. You're gonna want to start betting with the smallest amount possible, 10K. As you bet you will start gaining rewards, this can be anything from XP boost to wCases and chips. The start will require you to monitor your rewards for a bit. If you get wCases I suggest opening them straight away as you can hold a max of 3 at the same time. &#x200B; Once you reach level 50 you will receive a 24 hour double XP boost. This will be crucial to use moving forward as it will speed up the level process a lot. You shouldn't take very long to reach level 50 even with minimum bets. After you've received the XP boost you should check how many chips you've got and scale your bets accordingly. According to the games FAQ this will make you level up faster. &#x200B; >If you want to level up faster, there are a couple of things you can do: > >Spin more frequently, or try higher bets &#x200B; Personally I didn't see a big difference in the movement of the XP bar when doing higher or lower bets, but I'll trust their word for it. Here's how I would scale my bets, I did it in a way that I didn't have to monitor it very often, you can probably put the bets higher if you want to speed it up further, but that will require you to monitor it more often to make sure you don't lose it all. &#x200B; |0-2M Chips|10K Bets| |:-|:-| |2-5M Chips|20K Bets| |5-10M Chips|50K Bets| And you can scale it further the more chips you've got. &#x200B; Now you just let it idle for a while and check back every 10 levels maybe to see if you get any case drops & to scale up or down the bets. Also remember to check back in every hour to open the hourly case you've received. &#x200B; Once you reach level 100 you're gonna want to stay around as this will give you a medium case which can gift you plenty of chips, open it and go back to spinning. From level 101-199 the rewards are really lacking when it comes to cases and the XP bar will slow down, so you don't have to check in as often. You'll also want to check in when you reach level 200 as it gives you the best wCase for you to open. Personally I have never ran out of chips, the lowest I've been is 500k with minimum bets running, which is when I decided to try 'Journey' game mode. &#x200B; If you feel that you're about to run out of chips, go ahead and go to the 'Journey' section. This is a game mode that lets you play certain slots for a certain amount before you can move on to the next one and receive rewards between. I would jump into the slot and just spam the screen with my finger to speed up the spinning process, then I'd immediately go onto the next one when it was unlocked and collect the reward between them. Rinse and repeat, only did it for like 30\~ minutes as the rewards weren't very good unless you got lucky with a wCase. I've gotten a couple of wCases from the rewards, so if you're about to run out of chips this can be a way to get back on track. &#x200B; When you're about to sleep, just leave the app running on auto-spin with the lowest bet amount possible. When you wake up in the morning, go ahead and open the 3 cases you've received while you slept and keep spinning afterwards. &#x200B; This is all I did to personally finish the offer in 72\~ hours with a total hands-on time probably less than 2 hours. My 24 hour XP boost ran out when I had reached level 210, so I think I covered a pretty good distance. &#x200B; I'd also suggest leaving notifications on for the app, so you get notified about morning or evening bonuses you can claim. Also the 2nd day of playing you get to spin the lucky wheel twice a day, this will also be a nice bonus. The bonus wheel starts automatically when you enter the app if you're eligible for it. &#x200B; I also think it's possible to complete the offer by being completely idle after level 50 or 100. This will probably require you to do minimum bets or close to minimum and it will take a bit longer. &#x200B; **How to get more chips** * You get a free case every hour that can get you more chips. * Connect your Facebook to get 1M chips. (Might not be necessary) * Open cases you get from leveling up. * Enable notifications so you can get the free lucky wheel spins twice everyday. * Play the 'Journey' game mode and collect rewards. * Their social media has tons of links you can click to get more chips (Didn't work for me, they just take me to the developers home page, but worked for some people apparently), just scroll down a bit and you'll get to the posts. &#x200B; **Should you spend real money?** With the amount of free chips out there to grab, I don't think it's necessary to spend real money. &#x200B; **Can I speed it up further?** Yes, the more you bet, the more XP you get (According to their FAQ). I went the safe route and maximized the amount of XP I got from my chips without taking too much risk. If you increase the total bet you will get XP quicker, but you might also need more chips in-case you go on a losing streak and lose it all. Safest is what I recommend, but feel free to test collecting all kinds of rewards and starting of on a higher bet amount. It's also entirely possible that I missed out on certain features in the app or didn't find other ways to earn more chips. &#x200B; Any feedback or thoughts on the guide? Any additional things I should include?	beermoney

Guys jerk off in front of me on public transport and cause of anxiety I don't know what to do.	"This has happened for a few years now, the issue is it's not often enough where I'm no longer phased, it normally happens maybe once every 4 to 6 months and its almost always on an empty bus. I would sit in the front near the bus driver and then a guy across from me will sit on the other side not next to me (thank goodness) But right in front so I can see. Or I will be alone in a train car and a guy will sit in front of me or diagonal of me. &#x200B; I have a knife that's cover is a rape whistle in my backpack but I have really bad anxiety I dont drive and I dont have a car. I live in NYC so public transport is super important. &#x200B; If you ladies and gents can offer some advice for me id appreciate it. &#x200B; Cause (to me im not pretty or anything I normally wear oversized hoodies, jeans and sneakers) I have heard people say I should be ""Flattered"" because it means someone thinks I'm pretty when im not....

Many questions about stealth	1. Generally, are you better hidden ***in*** the bush or ***behind*** it? 2. Does changing the sight of hostiles via Infinite Heaven also affect hiding in a bush, or does it only affect the general sight while you don't have cover? 3. Is the stealth realistic in a sense that you are harder to detect when you minimize your size of appearance when being prone? (Lets say you want to go past an enemy, but have little room to maneuver - Is it smarter to move sideways while facing the enemy so you appear smaller to them, or would it be the same as crawling past them in a way that your side faces them?) 4. Does sideways rolling while prone make you harder to spot? 5. Do hostile conversations and animations (smoking, coughing, yawning, putting their gun over shoulder) decrease their sight temporarily? 6. Can you hide yourself behind another hostile? 7. Far Cry 2 user manual said that you are harder to detect when enemies are facing the sun. Does TPP also have some similar feature? Or is cloudy better for stealth than sunny? (8).

I looked up a British Youtuber who was busted for sexually coercing/abusing/harassing multiple underage girls a few years ago...	"And he holds a job as a recruitment consultant now. It got me thinking about how men are able to bounce back from their ""indiscretions"", no matter how grave, without so much as a peep from anyone, despite the fact that this guy was on record for having coerced and harassed multiple girls (some as young as 14) into doing sexually inappropriate things when he was a grown man in his 20s. Searching his name alongside his old YouTube handle brings up multiple posts on Tumblr (for some reason, that was the preferred platform for expos√©s back in the day). And yet this guy has faced zero tangible, real world consequences for messing with the lives of these girls/children. He simply deleted his online presence and got himself a job *the same year he was outed*. It's incredible what they get away with."	GenderCritical

KENIMEX SCORPION NELSON BORE GUNS AND PARTS	Hi everyone. This is my first post ever so please bare with me. I'm looking for some advice and knowledge of a big box of paintball guns and parts I came across when I was doing a demolition project that must have been stored away for 20 years plus.... After a little research they are Kenimex Scorpion Nelson bore style I believe from the 90's. I have 7 complete guns made up plus lots of brand new parts like powertubes, bolts etc. I will find how I can upload photos to here to show... I've read somewhere that these parts may or may not be compatible with other Nelson bore style guns but not sure.... All the parts are unused and amazes me how someone could just leave them sat there. Luckily they were properly sealed in bags... I will upload photos..... hopefully Anyone who knows anyone who may be interested in buying these off me or just some advice as to what I have and where I can sell them would be much appreciated. If anyone could possibly tell me how to upload photos it would be great	paintball
I can write the best during my bad spells	I don‚Äôt have food poisoning I have a poisoning in my brain A type of poison that makes everything dark The type of dark you spend all of your days trying to escape This poison, it seeps through my veins Into my blood stream, all the way to my heart It is dangerous you see, because it is accompanied by these voices These voices spend all day and all night telling me how worthless I am They tell me the world would be a better place without me in it They tell me how bad I am for those I love the most They are able to make me truly believe all of the words they are saying This poison, it not only talks to me, but it takes something from me too It takes all of my energy, leaving me to spend most days isolated in bed It takes all of my hope, leaving me to believe better days will never come It takes my sanity, leaving me to go crazy It takes pieces of my heart, leaving me convinced that not even love can save me.

A mini rant with some cussing and mentions of certain political topics	Okay, so if you‚Äôre offended by cussing and/or someone venting about conservative, anti-sex people, please just leave now. I‚Äôm. So. Fucking. Tired. Of. Conservative. People. Especially. The. Anti-Abortion. Ones. Because they always fucking say,‚ÄùKeep your legs closed!‚Äù They‚Äôre just anti-sex. And men fucking everyone in town is perfectly goddamn fine, but a woman enjoys having a cock in her pussy? OH NO, THAT‚ÄôS DIRTY AND WRONG! People who are lucky and blessed enough to enjoy sex and penetration don‚Äôt fucking understand. Men don‚Äôt fucking understand and seem to have a fetish for shaming women for enjoying fucking even though they enjoy it too. Women who are lucky enough to just fuck with no foreplay and their partner can thrust at the speed of light to satisfy himself while not causing her agony don‚Äôt fucking understand. Nobody understands what it‚Äôs like to not even be able to experience sexual pleasure/an orgasm. Maybe I‚Äôm just selfish. I don‚Äôt know. I think jealousy is love and hate blended together. Love because I see a movie scene where with virtually no foreplay the woman can allow her partner to screw her at the speed of light without being in agony and I think to myself,‚ÄùI wish I could BE that/like that.‚Äù Hate because I see that and think to myself,‚ÄùWhy can‚Äôt I be like that? Why does everyone else get to enjoy this so much, and I‚Äôm so defective that I can‚Äôt?‚Äù Anyways the movie is Shape of Water and you guys can tell me what you thought of it. Did you think the man was moving quickly? I‚Äôm sorry if I upset someone. I‚Äôm just pissed off and down.	vaginismus

2 years of restoration	Today I realized that I started restoring in January of 2018. I have had a pretty consistent restoration practice during that time. There were a few months in that time span where I dropped the ball but as a whole it has been consistent tugging for at least 4 hours a day or more with the TLC tugger. With all my efforts, I have not reached the point of roll over yet. There is a lot more slack in my skin and I can masturbate without using lubricant, which is awesome! I did however think I would be further along by this point. I have folded in some manual methods in addition the wearing the TLC tugger just to give the skin a different stretch. Any other advice from any seasoned restorers would be much appreciated.	foreskin_restoration
Question: Should Heidi N Closet change her drag name?	I mean, it became a running joke this season, but Heidi Aphrodite has a nice ring to it.

Which name would you like to see her use (either one already mentioned on the show or a new one)?	rupaulsdragrace

The Last Dance is the best documentary ever made.	"The music first of, is Hans Zimmer level of epic. The story telling is top notch and the revelations, even after 20 years later is still shocking. MJ, despite being the consummate ahole that he was back then, never changed my outlook that he is and forever will be the greatest to ever play the game. I'm still watching Episode 8 but I already think that this docu by far, is the best thing to hit television since the sixth season of Game of Thrones. Change my mind, otherwise. I would love to know that there's another existing show that could beat this in terms of quality and content. Edit: All right looks like I'm watching ""Hoop Dreams"" next so I can have some fair comparisons. Edit 2: You've proven once again that you can't be beaten. I'll look into your suggestions hoping it's not a waste of time."	nba
Quit smoking and bought a Venu with the money I've saved - I love it.	First I got the vivoactive 4s. It was great but too small. I sold it to my girlfriend and got vivoactive 4.

I use it for tracking my health and mental health, running, playing football and doing other cardio. Sleep algorythm could be better, but I'd say it has been pretty accurate for me.

Royals Delivers what players enjoy the most...	"Think about it... I'm playing this game for a long time, over 1000 hours in.. one of the best parts in the game happened when raids become a mess... you know, mechanoid raids with human raids and insects all at once, fighting. or manhunter pack and a siege, manhunter packs and traders.. this kinda stuff... I can also say that other people like this type of content, because of reddit upvotes... Prints of this situations got a good attention in this community, with people asking ""So, what happened? Who win?"" &#x200B; Now lets talk about Royals DLC... this DLC delivers exactly that, and I'm pretty sure this is on purpose... &#x200B; We have monuments that when they are destroyed what happens? Raids, manhunter packs, Etc. &#x200B; We have mechanoid clusters, that stay on the map, and attack raiders, manhunter animals, etc. &#x200B; We have quests that delivers a raid/insect hive/ manhunter pack in a few hours when you accept, and you sometimes have a good amount of time to accept it... &#x200B; All of this, in the last few weeks playing with this DLC, makes the game so fun... a lot of times was able to make the ""messy situation"" happen... just last night, i destroyed a block of a monument activating a 22 manhunter lynxes to destroy a new mechanoid cluster.... And the point i am making here is: i do think this is on purpose.. &#x200B; So yeah.. i just want to throw this out... What do you think? PS: English is not my primary language.. :)"	RimWorld

[HUGE spoilers for season 1] a summary of season 1's main events. [like seriously, this spoils everything, go watch the show if you haven't already]	"so [u/KaylieKonrad](https://www.reddit.com/user/KaylieKonrad/) posted wanting a recap of season 1 as it's been a while. I was originally going to comment on there, but it turned out to be so long I thought some other people could make some use of it, seeing that season 2 just got released a couple days ago. i'm assuming you know the basic storyline, three teens wake up in a room unsure of who or where they are, they solve puzzles and get out of bad situations all whilst trying to get home, theorising on where they are and get help from an omniscient and omnipotent god. so let's get deeper than just a very brief summary: the three main characters, Adam, Mira and Kai wake up in a bunker and solve a puzzle to get out, their main goal from the beginning is to get home and not die along the way, while theorising on where they are and why they're in this strange world. along the way, they meet this strange guy who can help them get out of situations and shed light on where they are, in a cryptic kinda way. they each discover that they have superpowers, Adam has super strength, Kai can control fire and knows a lot about mechanics and electronics, and Mira can breathe underwater, swim extremely well and speak to animals. after they make bonds, discover their powers, become comfortable in the world and make sense of things, they start to adjust and focus their energy on getting home. after falling through a portal the strange guy put there, they meet a talking tree who is missing a branch. the tree tells them that if they can get the branch back from some devil monks, she can take them home. the branch, as it turns out, is an insanely powerful weapon called the Ishibo. they manage to retrieve it from the monks after their leader falls to his death, but another group of three teens (ill call them group 2) who also have superpowers show up and steal it, making a quick getaway. After finding which direction group 2 went in, they find themselves in a western town, where they meet group 2, and this time have a civil discussion with them. group 2 is made up of Vanessa, Skeet and Reeve, who have powers of flight, speed and telekinesis respectively. Vanessa charms Kai into teaming up with group 2, but Adam and Mira aren't so trusting. Skeet and Reeve tell the trio that they lost the Ishibo, and the plan for the groups is to team up and retrieve the Ishibo, find the tree and go home together. However, Adam and Mira fall into a network of tunnels after getting ambushed by zombies, leaving Kai with group 2 and nowhere else to go. we follow Adam and Mira in the underground tunnels, and they meet a blind old man called Dave who guides them through the catacombs, he basically tells them to go find an ice castle and retrieve the Ishibo. when they get out of the tunnels, Adam sees Dave glitch in a way, he flickers, and Adam is rightfully spooked. He proposes a theory that they're in a videogame and that they need to ""win"" to go home. they get yeeted by the talking tree because they dont have the Ishibo and end up at the ice palace, where they see that group 2 and Kai are frozen in blocks of ice, with the Ishibo frozen with them. Kai escapes the ice using his firepower, and Adam tells Kai to melt the Ishibo out of the ice, but not group 2. Kai refuses as he has trust in group 2, and unfreezes them. group 2 betray them and attack Adam with the Ishibo, fatally wounding him. Vanessa insults Kai greatly and he is visibly hurt by this. they escape the ice castle and end up on the shores of a human-spider infested island. Adam is unconscious gets kidnapped along with Kai and Mira. Kai also used the last of their help from the weird guy.just before they got kidnapped, the weird guy shows up after a glitching spaceship crashes out of the sky, and tells them that the game is hella glitchy and they need to get out as soon as possible. Kai and Mira are taken to see the king spider centaur type thing, and he says he doesn't trust humans after group 2 cut off two of his legs. Kai fixes his legs, the spider heals Adam, and the trio is back on track. They ambush group 2, retrieve the Ishibo and head to the talking tree. She opens up a gateway for them, and the game is super glitchy at this point. they go to the final level, fight a dragon, jump through the portal, press a button and win the game. i tried to summarise the things that were only crucial to the storyline, i'll have missed riddles and foreshadowing for this reason, but if there's anything important i've managed to skip, please let me know. tl:dr - i honestly cant summarise the show much more than this, sorry folks"	TheHollowNetflix

Intensity = Truth	"**Intensity = Truth** Something I do that deviates from the Neville's teachings is in the category of undesirable thoughts. I know in the topic of manifesting, undesirable thoughts are considered a no no. I understand completely why you would not want to think an undesirable thought. However, we must be honest with ourselves. There are thoughts in our minds that repeat themselves and at times we feel intense about them. Even when we try to think a different thought, the feelings of the undesirable thought linger on and makes it difficult to feel the desirable thought fully. I know in Neville's teachings, the way around this would be through understanding. Understand that you are withholding yourself in a State. You have the freedom to move into different States with no consequences. Give yourself this freedom and you will feel elated. This works for me. However... There are thoughts that are so stubborn and they feel so intense that sometimes understanding is not enough. For thoughts that seems to have lasting effects throughout the day, and causes you to feel down, worried, fearful, I do something, that at first may seem counterproductive. This is what I do: When I notice a thought that I deem ""undesirable,"" and this thought is giving me intense negative feelings such as fear, making my gut sink, worry and I simply cannot shake it off (This is only for stubborn thoughts, not ones that you can easy turn away from), I do this: >1. I identify the exact thought that is making me feel fear. > >2. I think of this thought deeply and why it is giving me fear. > >3. I keep repeating this thought on a loop and on each repeat I react to it less and less. > >4. Eventually you will come to a point where you are no longer reacting to the thought. Now after I do this. I go to the desirable thought I want to think. And this is what I do: >1. Think about the understand that you are simply withholding a State from yourself. Then think of the desirable thought. > >2. I feel the thought being fulfilled. > >3. I repeat this thought (visualize or speak) with feeling over and over. With each repetition, I feel it more intensely. > >4. I do this, like a rhythm, until all I feel and think are blissful thoughts and feelings. So, what exactly is being done here? With reacting less and less to the undesirable thought, you are taking away its power. The ONLY power it has, is in your reaction to it. With not reacting to it, it will no longer bother you. Then you cannot stop there. Stopping there will leave you feel neutral, which is not bad, but use this time to feel after your desire being fulfilled. With each repetition of feeling intensely about a desirable thought, you are fusing or identifying with that thought. From doing this with those stubborn thoughts, you will find that they will no longer bother you. You will also notice your mind will think, naturally, about the desirable thoughts because you feel intensely about them. Remember, your mind thinks truth is intensity. To the mind: Intensity = Truth As I said, this is my own method with stubborn thoughts. We all have a few, but I found this method to work. Hope it works for you as well."	EdwardArtSupplyHands

"The site ""Cum On Printed Pics"""	"I posted about this site a little over a week ago to r/antipornography, but I figured posting it here will help get more people to realize what is going on. For those who may not already know about it, ""Cum On Printed Pics"" is a site where men post photos of women and request others to ejaculate onto the photos, or do it themselves and post the result. Yup. Disgusting. Most of the photos are clearly taken without consent from social media profiles and posted onto the site. Posters say tons of terrible things about the women in the photos, calling them pretty much every name in the book and saying in quite disturbing detail what they would do to them. If that wasn't disturbing enough, there is a ton of underage content posted on the site and the admin/mods don't seem to give a damn. I've reported the site a few times before, and some people over in r/antipornography did the same after I notified them about the site, but nothing has been done and I feel like more people need to know about it until it can finally be shut down."

Expanding an arthurian inspired region: The Gales	Hello, I'm taking a a small break from being a DM so I can work on my setting. The region called the Gales is a land inspired by the fairy tales of knight culture. To catch you up on the current situation. A group of knights had commited a coup against their kings, thinking the land would be better with them in charge. The knights make a council called the round table and established their own choices of knight royalty.(Note this isn't the goverment, think of something like the Lord's Alliance) When my PCs last played in my setting they witnessed the death of the knights leader and they inspired his apprentice to try to take control. I don't know how this will end , but I'm skipping 20 years into the future where I've tried fleshing them out more. I need to decide whats happened, but here's some current realms in the Gales. Kingdom of SunRest- Probably one of the oldest and largest of the kingdoms. Sunrest represents the glory of knighthood and constantly compete in tournies & large public events. Kingdom of Grailord- A land that was once full of hate and fighting, the kingdom was ripped into two dutchies for nearly a century before eventually repentance was made (might need help figuring out why) and the kingdom of Grailord is now a place known for it's comrodiry and kindhearted knights. Grailord represents the compassionate heart of knighthood Kingdom of Cashmere- A realm noted for its grimmer athmospere, this kingdom is on the frontline of a major war and it shows. The people aren't upset about tbis though, knights will gladly go out to eat because the greatest thing a knight can do is sacrafice themselves for the greater good. This kingdom represents a knights sacrafice and you can see it in their culture. Kingdom of Elden- The mountainy region of Alden has long been known for it's libraries of profuse knowledge and now it's also known for it's arcane academy, (I'd appreciate any help on making an interesting wizard school). It's well known for it's arcane knights and flying mounts that are conteolled with enchantment. Alden represents a knightly mind of teshnique and strategy. (Weak I know) Kingdom of Umbrin- A northern kingdom that was once nothing more then another barbarian tribe, but since then they've been accepted by their most knight for their bravery. They're usually fighting barbarian clans and other tribals, but recently the biggest problem is the tar dragon on black mountain and it's growing cult. Umbrin represent a knights bravery against all odds. Kingdom of Aurora- The neighbor of Umbrin, it's also the opposite. The knights here represent the monk class more then fighter, paladins or cleric. Castles work as monastaries and they believe in non-lethal take downs. (I'd like some help expanding this one out a bit.) The Dutchty of Gawain- A small realm located in the heart of Sunrest, Gawain is an realm given to an elven knight for his sacrafice in service of the coup. The land is magical and is legendes to be blessed by an ancient being. Gawain is still carving itself a place in the Gales. Thats all I have now, but I do have an open space left in the region. Its big enough for either 1 kingdom, 2 Principalities or 4 dutchies. I don't really know what to place there and i thought I'd ask you all. Any input will be appreciated. TLDR: just read it, sorry	DMAcademy
My party robbed the Blue Water Inn BLIND	Ash, Huck, Pablo, Stagla & Vala - why you gotta keep doing me like this?? Also stop reading NOW. So. My party has had a lot going on lately; a battle through the streets of Vallaki against Strahds children of the night (what music they make) and a close call with the BBEG (who the cleric thought would be a LITERAL pushover - don‚Äôt try that at home kids, Strahds opposed strength check ain‚Äôt nothing to be sneezed at) so they decided to take some R&R at the Inn after a long day... It turns out that part of that is robbing the ever loving crap out of the Martikovs. They subdued the ravens in record time, raided the hidden chest, found the secret door to the Martikov‚Äôs room, found the trapdoor, managed to figure out a stealth approach up and proceeded to rob the attic. Now I‚Äôm left unsure how to handle this. There were no witnesses, and they were smart enough to go back out the way they came in (through the stables), however they failed to remember to clean up the raven corpses, and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Unwin, Danika or the others discovers what has happened. Would the party be under immediate suspicion as the newbies in town? Would they confront the party themselves, have them be spied on to see if they are the culprits, call the town authorities (although I think they‚Äôd be loath to do that as much of that coin is tied to their secret society) or if the party gets out of town fast enough, do they just get away with it? I‚Äôm really unsure how to play this. Thank you for taking the time to read my novel, and any advice would be greatly appreciated! Tl;dr - my party robbed the inn, and now I‚Äôm unsure how this will effect the game going forward	CurseofStrahd

Lucid Sex + Flying + False Awakening	"After a serie of vivid dreams, my alarm rang. And instead of doing a technique, I just went back sleeping because I was lazy. I had a 2 long dreams before being lucid, then I found myself in my bed in darkness. I thought I was awake but I said whatever let's just do a reality check... I plugged my nose and I could breathe through it. I ""woke up"" in my old house, in my room. Then I started rubbing my hands cause my dream was fading away. Then I explored and as I was out of my house, chilling on my terrace, I told myself when I enter my house again, there will be the finest girl from ""Gooba"", you know that 6ix9ine new music vid. I went in and she was there, in my living room. You all know what I did next. No one really talks about these sex experiences, but every frequent lucid dreamer (which I'm not) had them. Well, anyway the sex didn't really seem real except for the orgasm which was so great, and in the morning, I had the sperm in my pants. Next thing I did was leave my house. I wanted to fly but I had never done it before. I also wanted to talk to my subconscious by interacting with dream characters, but no one was there. So I decided to fly. And I had it first try. I jumped, then I flew off. It was so incredible. I could see my native island. It was the same, until there was a part that my mind created. It was a Savannah. Without really controling it, I landed there. There were lots of elephants and other animals. Seconds after I landed, a Lion was trying to attack me. He was dangerously close to me. I took off just before it had me and was so amazed at all I had experienced Last thing that happened was my dad waking me up. He's not even in the same country I am but it didn't seem to surprise me. I was upset and told him he ruined my lucid dream. He told me I had things to do and he couldn't wait for me to wake up. Then, I woke up for good and still was upset, but this time for not realising I was still in a dream. Do a reality check everytime you wake up, this won't happen to you. Ps: During this dream, I had this problem with my eyes. Sometimes I could open both, but most of it, only my right eye was barely opened. It made my vision blurry, no matter how much I stabilized the dream. I still had a great time. But if someone knows anything about this, let me know thanks !"	LucidDreaming
Season 5 - Leslie	Re-watching season 5 of Masterchef and why is everyone so mean to Leslie? Honestly, he seems fine, or at least not as bad as everyone makes him out to be. In fact, there are a lot of much meaner people in this season (like Courtney and maybe even Daniel). I think his hate is unwarranted and that a lot of the things he got hate for (like when he got frustrated with Ahran during the wedding team challenge) were somewhat reasonable. Like how she did already unfairly judge him and was unhappy being on his team prior to the start. And also, the fact that Willie likes him must mean something. He was the nicest guy on the show and everyone loved him so his judgement of people must be reliable.	Masterchef

Mothers Day Gone Wrong	Second try, First was removed for naming the restaurant, which I did not do. I suspect it was removed because I mentioned I might have to go to \[Rest aurant Na me Here\] as a backup..... My wife wanted a special dinner for Mothers Day. So we called a local Italian restaurant. Its small place (\~12 tables) and the owner is there every night. Its very good food, rather expensive but worth it. Thinking it might be busy (its always busy) we called to place a pickup order at 4:45pm. I found out my food order would not be ready until 7:30pm! Yikes, thats later than we had planned but we went with it. Later dinner is fine. I arrive at 7:30pm and immediately see 20 people (some standing, some in cars) outside of the restaurant. Aw crap. Knowing each person is representing a single table, there enough people standing around that they would have to turn their restaurant twice to clear all those people. I call them and ask what the protocol is, do I get out and stand in line? Do I call back? Do they call me? She says they will call me. Ok. 8:10pm I have been sitting in my car for 40 minutes playing a mobile game. I call back. How is my order doing? I am told 30 more minutes. Ok. Its 8:10pm now, unless we switch to \[Rest aurant Na me Here\] for dinner I am out of options already. 8:40pm I call back but cant get anyone on the phone. I move to standing in front of the restaurant. I start chatting with some other customers. I hear there is tons of food sitting in bags inside of the restaurant. From all of the people who ordered food but didnt end up waiting. I must see this, so I move inside. Lots of people waiting inside too. I see probably 20 orders in bags sitting there. The tickets are next to the bags and the tickets all have the pickup times on them. All of the tickets I see have pickup times of 5:30pm-6:30pm (mind you it is now 8:40pm). I encounter two other people waiting that have pickup times of 6:30pm. I am not sure if that makes me feel better or worse. 9:15pm I have watched several people just leave without food. I have seen several people walk into the kitchen and tell them to cancel their order. At this point I heard someone say to cancel their order that had a 9:00pm pick up time. Holy Smokes! they took orders with pick ups out to 9:00pm? They havent even got food to some people with 6:30pm pickup times! They are going to be here making food until midnight! 9:45pm The owner comes out from the kitchen to apologize to the people still waiting. (about 8-10 people I suppose) 10:00pm I got my food! and a $40 gift certificate. Unfortunately my wife was asleep when I got home. So this food is lunch today I guess. My Thoughts: I have no idea why they allowed so many orders to be placed. Perhaps they thought they could make a lot of money. But judging by the number of orders that were unclaimed I am not sure how profitable of a night it was. And they pissed off a lot of their customers.	TalesFromTheCustomer

How the Death Cleric Outsmarted the DM to Save the Newbie Paladin.	This story takes place at the game store I am playing at. I am fairly new to D&D having only played for two months, but am familiar with D&D's overall mechanics due to podcasts and streams. This knowledge helped me outsmart my DM in the tale to come. In this game of Descent into Avernus, I am playing a Firbolg Death Cleric of Kelemvor and the newest player is playing an Aarakocra Paladin. The new player often irritated the party by acting like the protagonist, smiting first and asking questions later, using all of the artificer's buffs to get 21 AC, and wanting to allocate party funds towards a full set of enchanted plate armor for himself. Note, the party was level three at this point. His holy Paladin also did not like me because I was a Death Cleric. Yet, he always seemed to ask for my healing. In his defense, the Paladin had never played D&D before and approached it like fantasy games he had played-Skyrim and Dark Souls. Up to this point in the story, the Paladin had managed to kill and smite his way through the campaign which boosted his confidence and dominant playstyle. So when our party had emerged from a dungeon with our chests of loot to encounter an ambush from cultists of Tiamat, the Paladin had no fear. Our Warforged died outright in this encounter, and the Paladin said he could just roll a new character. Imagine the Paladin's surprise when at the end of the encounter the last two cultists manage to put him on Death Saving Throws (For those who do not know, if a player is put on Death Saving Throws they must roll three successes to stabilize to 0 hp. Three failures is death. Rolling a ten or higher is a success, and nine or lower is a fail. If a player stabilizes, all Death Saving Throws are reset. However, if the dying player is attacked at any point, the attack is an automatic hit. Each attack counts for two failed saving throws. This knowledge is important for later on.) The cultists demanded we give them the chests and let them escape lest they kill the Paladin. None of the party or the DM really cared if the Paladin died especially since he could re-roll a new character, just like he told our Warforged to do a few rounds ago. Having the Paladin die would also allow the party to no longer allocate funds towards that enchanted full set of plate armor he wanted. However, I could see the Paladin becoming visibly upset at losing his character so I chose to parley with the DM. For context, cultist 1 is holding the Paladin at knife point, and cultist 2 is demanding the chests. DM: The cultists have two held actions on the Paladin if anyone attacks. Me: I give my chest to cultist 2. The party is taken aback and start to bicker amongst themselves. DM: Paladin roll your Death Saving Throw. It's a 19, success. Sorcerer: I fire bolt cutlist 1. DM: It hits, and she looks bloodied but doesn't die. Paladin, a knife sinks into your chest. You fail two death saving throws. I am mentally cursing at my sorcerer. His attack was well intentioned, but it was ruining my plan. Me: Everyone, give your chests to them. Most of the party argues and grumbles before dragging the hard earned loot to cultist 2. DM: Paladin, roll. 11, another success. Cultist 2: Thank you. Now would kindly back up to the entrance from where you came. The party begrudgingly trudges back to the entrance. DM: Paladin, roll. 11, the final success. DM: Paladin you are no longer dying but are still unconscious. At this point, my first plan had worked. I had bought enough time for the Paladin to roll his saving throws. He thankfully succeeded in all of them, despite the two automatic failures from the firebolt attack. Now, there are still two held attacks against the unconscious, but no longer dying, Paladin. Phase two of my plan begins. Cultist 2 picks up two of the four chests; and the DM appearing smug, looks expectantly at the party. Me: I let him round the corner. The party and DM stared in disbelief trying to figure out what I was doing. Me: Cultist 2 has used his action to pick up the chests and used his movement to round the corner, correct? DM: Yes‚Ä¶ Me: I cast chill touch at cultist 1. DM: The cultist sees your attack incoming and stabs your Paladin who‚Ä¶ There was a long pause before the DM‚Äôs face fell as he realized my plan and his mistake. I had bought enough time for the Paladin to stabilize, let cultist two‚Äôs held action to be used to carry the chests; and with the Paladin re-stabilized, he could tank one more stabbing and only be down two of his three failed Death Saving Throws. Me: I rolled an 18 to hit with 7 for damage. Cultist 1‚Äôs body crumpled in a heap, as our Life Cleric rushed to heal Paladin. The rest of the party pursued cultist 2; and after a small chase scene, the party killed the last cultist, reclaiming our chests of loot. As an update, it has been a few sessions since this encounter, and the Paladin has chilled out a bit more by working as a team member and less like a protagonist. I mean, after having his holy Paladin being saved by the Death Cleric he disdained, his 21 AC confidence got knocked down to a more tolerable level. &#x200B; by Pond .	AllThingsDND
It‚Äôs getting hard	It‚Äôs getting really hard to believe that God loves me. I was 100% healthy my whole life. Then in 2016 everything changed and it just keeps getting worse and worse. I‚Äôve had health anxiety my whole life but I had it under control for the most part. In 2016 my mom has a stroke. She recovered fine and didn‚Äôt have any lingering effects, thank God. At the same time I had an abnormal pap which turned out to be ok and I‚Äôve had normal ones ever since. Then in 2017 I had a lump in my breast which also turned out to be nothing serious... then 2018 hit and I took my mom to the ER because we thought she was having another stroke. She tuned out to be ok again. I had some weird inverted ear drum thing which made it hard to hear but it eventually went away. At the same time my sister moved far away and a lady at work died.. then I started getting pressure in my head and I felt dizzy from it all the time... in July 2019 I ended up going to the doctor for the head pressure thing and she said it was tension headaches... so I have been dealing with that ever since. Back in October 2019 I had gotten 2 dry red patches of skin on my legs... turns out I now have nummular eczema. It did go away after using steroid cream but I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs a chronic illness and I‚Äôll have to deal with flare ups for the rest of my life... I just don‚Äôt understand what I did so wrong to deserve all of this happening to me. It feels like God hates me and isn‚Äôt even there for me. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve become so depressed.	Christian
"Your ""chonker"" dog isn't cute"	Obese dogs are not cute and I feel so fucking sorry for them. Letting your dog get fat doesn't make him cute and quirky ,its literally just animal abuse. I don't even understand how these people's dogs get so fat? Do they just never walk them at all I don't get it??? I saw a post on the front page with 55k likes and it's just a morbidly obese husky... Why get a husky (or any working breed) if you're not going to exercise it. Maybe use the time you use posting your close to death animal to exercise your damn dog instead.	unpopularopinion

The Pain of being a Hammer Main (Poem+partial serious discussion topic)	Oh hammer, you sweet pain Why have I ever made you my main &#x200B; Every strike and every swing Massive damage you will bring &#x200B; I rumble and tumble And aim for the face Then watch every monster crumble Under you sweet embrace &#x200B; But how I suffer so For every other weapon I try It just feels too slow &#x200B; No other weapon does damage like you do Tried the sword and board But the damage didn't follow through &#x200B; Bow, Bowgun, Dual blades Every one of them suffers the same fate For I have yet found A weapon so efficient to equate \--------------------------------------------------------------- &#x200B; Alright, now for something serious. I'm wondering if other people have this problem, mainly hammer (and probably GS) mains. Every other weapon feels slow compared to the hammer and I find it really difficult to get used to new weapons. And Im not meaning slow as in using it, but in dealing damage. I can take down a monster in 20 min in terms of damage where it just takes longer with any other weapon. Lot more dodging etc going on. And this is not too serious, I understand if I practice enough I can do the same damage with all weapons, but the hammer just makes the switch difficult. &#x200B; So the question, do other people have this problem?

Moving to WPB from Port St Lucie	So I‚Äôm hoping to move to WPB as soon as I can to be closer to work on PGA Blvd, but I don‚Äôt mind a 30min commute. I‚Äôm making 3.5k a month and was looking for a 1/1 or a studio around 1.1k a month, I want to live alone. Ideally I would like central air and a washer and dryer to be in the unit. Are there areas I should avoid? I‚Äôve been looking on Zillow and apartments.com and I really struggle to find anything that doesn‚Äôt have a catch. Also looking around lake worth if anyone has insight on that. I‚Äôm 23 and this is my first time ‚Äúleaving the nest‚Äù as they say so really any advice is welcome, even if it is tough lol. Thanks!

VIP 14 or Books of Covenant to rush T5?	I'm a mid-tier spender (growth fund, monthy gem supply, recharge events, and a few daily chests).I just got VIP12 and I have the gems to go just to vip 13 (around 150k gems).I'm only spinning wheels 10 times , as I still don't know for sure my troop orientation and my target commanders, and that's why I wanted to focus on getting as many universal heads as I can.So my objective was always vip 14.But as a ch25, I just realised I will soon be out of buildings to upgrade for a long time if I don't upgrade my castle which is still level 18 ( I am missing around 163k gems worth of books) . the rate I acquire books is very low (I recently started doing forts as much as i can and get around 50 books per day, so I will need more than 320 days to gather all books for free).Plus I want the extra 7% research speed the level 25 academy will give me, as I still have a heap of research to do before T5, and more than a year of universal speedups (not enough for T5 still, but I am acquiring many speedups from alliance gifts every day, because I'm in a spenders' alliance). So I'm in a dilemma: 1. will I use a large amount of gems on books when my building comes to a halt, in order to win valuable research time and get sooner to T5? but on the same time, lose months of vip 14 (and thus a corresponding amount of gold heads), or 2. use it only on vip and just ramp up on forts. as a result, in the long run I would have a few hundreds gold heads more, but I would lose a lot of research time, and my building would be at a halt for months, and T5 would come many months or even more than a year later. My aim is to kick some asses in war, and for this I need both T5 AND expertised top tier legendaries. I know everyone thinks differently, so I'm not asking you what to do.I'm asking what would you do in my position.	RiseofKingdoms
Python Intermediate/OOP Tutorials	Hi everyone, I am making an intermediate/object oriented python tutorial series at the moment. It will cover all aspects of object oriented programming in python, from creating classes to static methods to composition! Everything is explained clearly in an easy to understand way, and if you don't understand anything, I reply to comments usually within 24 hours. Here is the link to the first video, where I explain classes and instances. The next video will be out tomorrow, explaining methods and attributes: [https://youtu.be/r5BgVJNB5JA](https://youtu.be/r5BgVJNB5JA) I hope those looking into object oriented programming in python will find this useful!

Switched batteries, now lights stay on without the key inserted. Any ideas?	So my bike was stolen out of my college apartment complex last month, but the police found it a few days ago and I went to pick it up. It didn‚Äôt seem like anything was missing from it, and it seems like whoever took it just left it outside for a month (fuck me right) The thing started beautifully when I replaced the battery, but after I rode it around the block and took out the key, I noticed all the lights were still on - mainly the headlights and rear light, as if it were still running. Further, you can start it without the key inserted as well. My theory was whoever stole it might‚Äôve tried hot wiring it and screwed up somewhere between the ignition and battery, but I was wondering any of you have had a similar experience. Thanks for your help!	motorcycles

Considering one of you is heavily scientific-minded while the other is heavily humanities-minded, I think it'd make for an interesting discussion.	NDQ

Massive lists from throwaway accounts of reddit.	I've noticed over the past few months that whenever I search for something on here (typically a celebrity's name), one of the main results is always a throwaway accounts post of an extremely long list of celebrity names in alphabetical order. And the only comments are additional throwaway accounts adding more names to the list(with the exception of one comment thanking the OP.) And I'm talking thousands upon thousands of names. Just curious, is there some reason for these lists. I would think that if they're looking for traffic and clicks, they would use a permanent profile. Any ideas or info is greatly appreciated.

Feeling truly is understanding	I am done with the conventional method. Tonight I didn't count breaths I just inhaled and exhaled as much as I felt I needed, then held my breathe without any counting and without timers and just felt. I did this for maybe 4 or 5 rounds I hardly even counted those as well. Following this I used the last round (as I normally would) as like a Segway into meditation and I really feel like I had a breakthrough. At certain times I truly felt as if I was just awareness and not in any physical form, I was just there observing being existant. Truly an amazing breakthrough for me, I'm so excited for this new path I will continue down and follow as I feel my way through. I'm sorry if none of this makes sense or is out of context I've just only come back from this and needed to get it down somewhere and share it with anyone. For those of you who are looking for something within yourselves through this method, remember to feel and you will understand	BecomingTheIceman

TIFU by asking my partner to crack my back...	"So I'm going to preface this with this happened at the beginning of last week but I am very much stil paying for it... no one blames anyone for anything that's transpired and I am aware of the stupid decisions in this story. I've had back problems for the better part of my life, I used to do gymnastics and between that and the mild scoliosis, turns out I did some pretty good damage to myself. So I routinely self adjust my back and neck. I've gotten it down pretty good with the exception of the 4 vertebra between my shoulder blades. As far as I can figure out it's impossible to adjust those bones yourself. So this is mistake number 1, only adjusting part of your spine leads to issues, I know this, I do it anyways. So the result of that is I get very intense pain in my upper back and shoulders from the gas build up, I was desperate one night and asked my partner to adjust it for me. I showed him how to place his hands and push. Mistake number 2. My partner is a husky boy, he has been described as ""beautifully bear bodied"" and I have been told very recently I ""definitely need to gain weight"" (quarantines been rough y'all!). We get into position and he starts pushing, I feel a pop, no pain so I assume he's got something I didn't know needs to be adjusted. He keeps going, still not getting the joints to crack. He tries one last time (bless this man honestly he just tries his best) and I feel something.. not right. So we stop, we do our nightly routine (rip a bowl and throw on some shows) before bed and all is good. However when I woke, I swear to god it felt like someone had dug a giant spade into my side and it was peaking out the back. I look in the mirror, no bruising, but something's not right. I can't really tell much though and the pain started to subside through the day so maybe I just slept weird. The next day I woke up DRENCHED in sweat. Now I'm not a very sweaty person, I can count on one hand how many times this has happened to me. So I'm uncomfortable I have a fan blowing on me and a wet shirt on, so I go to take it off and the pain hit, instinctively I just grabbed my rib, light pressure and it felt way better! So I just sat with some pressure of for a bit. One I released my hand however the pain was back tenfold. Now your probably thinking hey you're now day 2 of terrible pain, maybe look at yourself a little harder in the mirror. Well when you and your partner are both hypochondriacs that's not usually the best option, it's actually something we both avoid regularly or we pick. So day 3 morning I wake up SOAKED again, finally I go and look in the mirror and my left side looks kind of swollen but I can't really tell unless I suck in. So I do that, fight through the pain and realize... The left isn't swollen... The bottom of my right side (where it kind of comes to a ""point"" if that makes sense) is sunk in. So I start to lightly prod my rib/sternum area and sure enough right where my rib connects to my sternum there is intense pain, if I follow the rib to the back, there is also intense pain. So basically to me and my paranoid self this confirmed I most definitely have broken a rib in two places. So I freak out, wake my partner up, he looks at it, his face sinks, and we're pretty sure he cracked my ribs. Were in a pandemic, none of the clinic's around me are open, and Telehealth doesn't cover anything past minor issues. So what do? You guessed it, to google! After many longs paranoid hours of searching I have no definitive answer on what happened to me just that if it is broken, they can't cast it so really the only course I can't take right now is pain management. And if it's not broken, essentially the same thing. First (possibly) broken bone and of course, it happens now. Every breath hurts, I never knew sneezing could cause so much pain, and guys, appreciate your normal range of movement I tried to open a window in my basement yesterday and needed to ask for help... TL;DR Local gentle giant fulfills fragile woman's request for cracked bones and exceeds expectations! More at 11."	tifu

How one character contributed to Shaun realizing that Lea makes him more	When Shaun held his monologue in 3.19 ‚ÄúHurt‚Äù of how he loves Lea because she makes him more than a *good doctor*, I wondered for some time how he came to this conclusion. So, I went back to the dialogues of past episodes and found two distinct conversations with a series regular that seem to build to the idea of the loved one making you more (besides the patients of the week, that also had their fair share in this). >2.13 ‚ÄúXin‚Äù: **Your life is better with her. You're a better person with her. Y-You need her. That's what love is.** > >3.17 ‚ÄúFixation‚Äù: **Lea's right. She is needy and selfish. Find someone who loves you the way you are.** ‚Äì People always say that, but shouldn't we be with someone who makes us a better version of ourselves? ‚Äì **Maybe. But trying not to be autistic won't make you better.** Guess which character said this? It was Morgan *twisted biatch* Reznick! Did I miss other relevant lines by other regular characters or has had Morgan more good influence on Shaun than we ever dared to believe‚Ä¶ ? ;)	thegooddoctor

36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar.

Pro-Nederlanddemonstraties aangekondigd op Facebook	"**LEEUWARDEN - Op de bekende website Facebook hebben verschillende mensen in Friesland en daarbuiten aangekondigd komend weekend grootschalige demonstraties te houden.

What are your thoughts on where Siege is at currently?	I've been playing Siege since Operation Chimera. When I first started playing the game I was god awful, couldn't win a gunfight to save my life and didn't know how the game worked. I took some time away and just learned the game, watched YouTube vids from pros and popular channels to get an idea how the game worked. I came back to the game and fell in love with it, it's all I've played. Since that time I've been ranked Plat and hover around a 1.4 w/l and a 1.5kd and from where I came from when I started I was proud of that. Lately though, I've just felt apathetic to the game, playing it has been more of a chore than something I enjoy doing. Maybe I'm just burnt out from playing or just lost the joy of meeting up with my friends and getting a few games together each night. Just curious what everyone else's thoughts on the game and where it currently is? TL;DR: Used to love the game, don't really anymore. How do you feel about Siege?	Rainbow6
My fianc√© is unemotional and never shows his feelings but I made him feel giddy and super flattered over this odd compliment	"So my fianc√© and I are complete opposites. I am very emotional and he is very rational. Despite we have conflicting interests, which I find sometimes annoying, I believe our differences makes us attracted to each other. Hear me out--he is the type of man who never becomes emotional over the small stuff. He is not open with his feelings. Like what I said, he is rational...almost too good to be true. STORY: My fianc√© and I were separated because of quarantine. Awhile ago, during our nightly phone calls, he mentioned to me that he recently almost drank every night since he found it enjoyable to do so while watching Netflix. Even if I was concerned about his health and weight, I told him to enjoy himself. Due to the heavy traffic he endured several months ago due to his previous work and the sudden unemployment he experienced afterwards before quarantine, I liked him to have fun for now especially that he is now working from home. Also, he works now in a respectable company. However, he said, ""what if after this we see each again and you see me have a big belly?"" And my reply, ""I still love you no matter what."" And you know what? He acted so giddy like a little girl and his voice went high pitched saying, ""really? you'll still love me?"" Of course, I said yes! Gosh, out of all the cheesy confessions I told him and he did not show emotions about it, this simple comment, ""I'll still love you no matter what"" works wonders?? Can you guys explain why?"	relationship_advice
Was Lovecraft ever known to watch any movies?	I understand film was perhaps not as commonplace at that time as it is today - and I‚Äôm just *guessing* it may have been expensive for some people? But there were plenty of movies to come out within his lifetime like Nosferatu, Phantom of the Opera, and Metropolis. Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton were pretty popular then, and in his last couple of years the Three Stooges came about. It seems like there was still plenty to see. Also I *vaguely* remember him describing in a letter (or maybe it was a character in a story) that he went to a demonstration of television, so i thought maybe movies would interest him as well. Did he ever describe movies in his letters?	Lovecraft

Dagegen spricht Einiges: Nennenswert Zinsen gibt es nur im Ausland und dort ist das Risiko entsprechend gr√∂√üer. F√ºr mehr Rendite k√∂nnte man auch den Aktienanteil erh√∂hen... Daf√ºr spricht, dass das Geld sonst nur rumliegt und es ja irgendwie eine Risikostreuung ist, das Geld wo anders zu investieren als in Aktien. Wie handhabt ihr das? Seid ihr bei einem Portal wie Zinspilot? Wie verargumentiert ihr vor euch selbst, dass euer Geld nicht ""arbeitet""?"	Finanzen

I'm (almost) a straight A student. AMA	For a bit of context, I live in Romania where the grading system works with grades from 1 to 10, 1 point being given for participation. I've always learned for test and the lowest grade I got was a 4 (F in american system) at Romanian (English equivalent in my country). Next lowest grade i think was and 8 (somewhere at around C/B). I haven't gotten any 4's after that one. My current situation is 10 over the whole year. I'm happy to respond to any questions. Sorry if I don't immediately respond.	AMA

I hate my family	"So basically my brother asked for help when i was sound asleep, being sleepy asf i said no. And so my idiot of a brother told my fucking mom and said ""kor kor told me to go die"" even though i had hardly enough energy to form a damn sentence. 2 minutes later, my bitch of a mother walks in and yells at me for ""saying a mean phrase to my brother"" then, out of nowhere, my extra of a father, that ONLY comes into my life to scold me, pops in and asks repeatedly ""what i said"" like a spoilt record. After hearing that, without even clarifying with me, he confiscates me Macbook and xbox, then my mom smacks me with a cane (long stick used for beating) and talks down to me, insulting me over and over. Im 14 and im still getting treated like this btw, I wanna run away and never see them again, i want to renounce my family name as i'm ashamed to have it. I want to murder them in cold blood. It's only a matter of when i will do it"	teenagers
Remember when the complaint was that every deck played Piloted Shredder, Sludge Belcher, and Loatheb?	Back in the GvG days we got frustrated that seemingly every deck (aggro, midrange, control) played Piloted Shredder, Sludge Belcher, and Loatheb, neutrals that dominated their mana slots. Highlander decks are beginning to give me a similar feeling. Minus a few standouts (Tempo DH, 'Pain' Warrior, Face Hunter, Priest to some extent) it seems like every class is trending towards highlander and seeing Zephyrus and DGA most games (on both sides) is getting old. They generate different cards, but the games feel like a waiting game until one deck can find some massive board swing to try to win the game. Zephyrs (as cool as he is) and DGA are so powerful, that every deck is going highlander just to have access to board clear and the 9-mana bomb turn. I'm not sure why they were made neutral cards. At least Bran summoning Krush feels Hunter'y, but hunter wiping your board with Zephrys is not really something Hunter should be doing. Rogue is not supposed to be good at board clearing either, but Zephrys lets them do it... and then they try to highroll the 0-mana DGA, which is a little salt-inducing. I've become concerned with the state of highlander decks. It seems every deck is trending towards highlander. There is almost no benefit to playing a non-highlander deck and no cost to playing a highlander deck because cards like Zephrys and DGA are so splashable and flexible. These 2 may generate different cards every time, but the games are beginning to feel too similar regardless.	hearthstone
I honestly found myself more impressed and felt more emotions watching the Mythica series than the new Star Wars films	This is not another anti-star wars rant. But I would like to point out that the Mythica series which was produced on a micro-budget kept me entertained for 7 hours. I have never seen a fantasy epic overachieve more than that series. I thought the action was crisp, the acting was solid and the world building and costume design was fantastic. Obviously special effects could have been better but this was independently financed. The first movie takes awhile to get going but I really enjoyed and I felt they got better as they went on. With the new Star Wars films I just felt like they lacked heart at sometimes. I never felt that with these	movies

Would a QoL league be badly received?	Let's except the case of GGG keeping the QoL features for PoE 2 for whatever reason. Let's say there's not enough time to develop a new league and QoL or various fixes (like performance). Would the player accept it if GGG did a league with only QoL and fixes, no new league mechanic ? It could either be a standard league ladder or a revival of a popular past league. Would you still play it?	pathofexile

Trying to save up for first home	My fiancee (25F) and I (25M) are trying to save up for our first home. If not much changes, we are hoping to have about $70K saved up by the end of the calendar year and we want to buy our first home together in the CA Bay Area shortly after (aiming to have 10% down payment). We want to live in the home but are also aiming for at least a two bath so we have the option to rent out a room. Her dad is also in construction (owns a concrete company) so we are also seriously considering buying a lot and building from scratch but I'm not sure if we'd be able to afford the needed down payment for that type of loan. Building would definitely be preferable if we could swing that. Combined we make $139,000 before taxes. Currently we have $46,000 in savings accounts ($26,000 is in a high APY Discover savings account, the rest in a normal Chase savings account). We also have $1880 invested in gold (1oz). We took all of our money out of stocks 3 and a half years ago and are trying to avoid risks. Other than meeting my employer 401k match, I don't plan on saving for retirement until we have a house as I see that as also an investment. In a few years (around 28-29) we are also going to try and start having kids. I lurk this sub a lot and I'm really just looking for a sanity check as well as any advice for achieving our goals in the quickest/least risky way. Given the current state of everything I'm also worried about high inflation but not sure if that's a valid concern. Thank you.	FinancialPlanning

Microsoft Premier Support Alternatives	By now, most if not all of you that have MS Premier Support agreements have been shown the glorious replacement for Premier called Unified Support. For those that aren't aware, Premier Support allowed you to purchase the contract sized appropriately to your org's support needs. The primary intent of these services was to provide support for your MS products. If you didn't use your hours for support incidents, you could convert those hours to use on proactive services or other 'nice to haves'. Now, with Unified Support, you are forced to pay for a service level that is based on your current MS spend. You get access to a dizzying ton of shovelware services that they present as the real reason to go with Unified and all-you-can-eat incident support included as an afterthought. For our org, the incident support was the primary reason for having the contract. The ability to convert that spend to something useful if we didn't have any significant incidents that year was an added bonus. MS still made a killing in that hourly conversion, but at least it wasn't a totally sunk cost for us. Even with this flexibility, we still struggled to use the hours completely every year. In our scenario, going from Premier to Unified is a 4-5x multiplier on cost. Graciously, MS allowed us to renew our Premier agreement for one final year. The number they want now is an absolute non-starter, especially given our current financial climate of trying to preserve cash. So, what are the alternatives if we just want a provider to help us get back up and running in a major incident that we can't solve ourselves? I've heard of US Cloud, but I haven't liked what I've read. What alternatives have you looked at or used? Our primary MS technologies are Windows Server and workstations, AD, O365 (has its own support except for on-prem integrations), and a small amount of Azure. Thanks all, stay frosty.	sysadmin

EVERYBODY is doing the Sage-Omen bug in Split. Rankeds are ruined.	I played 3 Split games today. All three of those games enemy team had Sage and Omen. They exploited the bug and even though we won the 3rd game, it was not fun. For those who dont know the bug, Omen can teleport outside the map on A site of map Split with help of Sage wall. He can see and wallbang anybody on A site, heaven and ramp. Enemy teams play 5 A all game, wait for Omen to take position and go in for a plant. Sometimes they even try to knife after the plant, because there is no way you see Omen and they know round is over. This is an absolute disaster. Please fix or intimidate with bans so we can play again. Right now I have to dodge every Split game.	VALORANT

Could use a little help while outlining (fantasy story problem, first-time author)	Greetings and thank you for checking this out, **The Charakters:** **Aldritch**: The protagonist, target of the mercenaries, son of basically the head of the magic mafia (the gus, who create and maintain magic contracts) who went on to study magic, is now on bad terms with his powerful family and is btw, a high level illusionist. Aldritch also has a fair understanding of the ins and outs of his families businesses, but there are certainly holes **Charlie**: A young pickpocket, who got teached a little bit of illusion magic by Aldritch, who fled his terrible living conditions together with him, feels indebted to Aldritch Charlie knows how to navigate the more troublesome places of society and can be helpful, when dealing with criminal activities **Josephine**: Former love-interest forr Charlie, now good friend, is a little bit cruel, manic, comes from the house of a minor noble and ran away from home to sick it to her stingy father Josephine, although she hates it, has knoweldge about the ins and outs in court and is rather talented at playing naive and innocent **Ms. Tucket**: Josephines brawny combat-maid, who protects her with her own life, out of a sense fo debt she feels towards Josephines lost mother. She is basically the badass-butler steereotype with a russian accent. She is a great survivalist and knows the ins and outs of adventuring very well, while she is also a talented maid. &#x200B; **Main Plot:** The main plot of the story is a group of charakters trying to find and infiltrate the Archives, a place where all sorts of documents regarding illegal activities are stored in a high security vault, to destory a contract, wich binds a group of undead mercenaries to their task of eliminating the party. (Aldritchs family, minus his aunt, want to rid themselves of the deserter for good this time) **The problem:** I am currently at about the first third of the outlining at the step where the group is supposed to find the rough location of the Archives, to establish a small base of operations for themselves, where most of the story will take place. My current problem, however is how they obtain the information of the location of the archives, wich are basically a myth in my world. &#x200B; **Possible solutions:** I have multiple possible options with varying dregrees of interest and charakter interaction. As a time -frame i have basically a whole chapter planned for aquiring this information: 1: Aldritch knows the location of the archives from his time in his family, as these locations where crucial to their business of trading and maintaining favors (he could also have been too young) 2: Aldritch contacts his aunt (his aunt rather crazy) per letter, to inquire about the archives. The answer will most likely be cryptic 3: Either Aldritch, or Charlie could have information regarding the transport of the contracts, to discern the rough location of the Archives. They would then track a courier, wich is identifiable via a random trait/object. This would include a nice scene, where Charlie and Aldritch could show off their skills in stealth and deception respectively. The tricky point here is how to aquire the information about the couriers, or means of transport. 4: Aldritch could use one of his 3 favors (he will need at least one later on in the story) to simply aquire the information no matter from wich source (these favors are quite powerful in my world, as Aldritch snatched a few before he left his family. These favors are basically a Get-out-of-jail-free-card, wich allow you to demand actions, wich are normally borderline impossible, like having someone place a certain item at a certain location without question. favors, of course, have their limits) 5:They could somehow get hired to conduct the transfer of the documents to the Archives through a great deal of deception and impersonation These are a few options i could think of, but i would highly welcome other suggestions too. If you have other quesitons I would be glad to answer them. I really try to keep my story logical and without any huge inconsitencies and this part really jumbled my marbles. Thank you very much for your feedback and have a wonderful day :)	writers

Lack Of PPE	I am a store manager of a store downtown and I am extremely concerned about the lack of PPE and cleaning supplies to open and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. We opened for curbside last week and were told that corporate would be sending us masks to wear while doing curbside. We still have not received them. I am down to one canister of Lysol wipes and no other cleaners. When I told my district manager, I was told to keep trying office depots website. She was going to get us gloves but has walked that back saying it isn‚Äôt required to have gloves. I called the city health department and was just told that the masks could be any face covering, that employees should wash their hands once an hour and that we should partner with other distributors to find cleaners. Overall, he just didn‚Äôt seem like he cared and gave excuses for my company which I have already heard all week. I‚Äôm genuinely concerned for the safety of my employees because I have a couple who are high risk that have to come back or I have to fire them. I‚Äôm not sure what to do to keep my customers and my team safe and I‚Äôm not sure who I should be reaching out to for a solution, the health department is no help.	cincinnati
New Legendary Hunter Idea	"My friend mentioned to me how the Bald Knobbers where a gang active in Missouri post civil war. Their look and mask is very distinctive and would fit in to Hunt: Showdown very well. Some quotes from the Wikipedia post: The **Bald Knobbers** were a group of vigilantes in the Ozark region of southwest Missouri from 1883 to 1889. They began as a group dedicated to protecting life and property, aiding law enforcement officials in the apprehension of criminals, opposing corruption in local government, and punishing those who violated the social and religious mores of their community. In some places, the vigilantes gained much political influence, occupied key offices, and became effectively the ruling faction in local politics. They made many enemies, however, with whom they had several violent, sometimes fatal, confrontations. In 1886, after gaining national notoriety from their exploits, and embarrassing state leaders, Missouri Governor John S. Marmaduke sent Adjutant General J.C. Jamison to Forsyth to investigate the situation. Upon arrival, although the representative was pleased to see the atmosphere of order that prevailed, he recommended to Kinney that an official dissolution of the Bald Knobbers would be in the best interest of the county. That next day a formal dissolution ceremony was held in the town square where the Bald Knobbers were publicly disbanded, having served their original purpose. It would make sense for the gang members that ""Lost"" their purpose in Missouri to decide to move to Louisiana and start hunting depraved evil monsters in an effort to restore order. They already have the violent tendencies of the other gangs of hunters in the game. With the perverse idea of restoring order to a lawless area. https://preview.redd.it/1jo3hfx275y41.jpg?width=575&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a35c4aaae9c0e98456ad213c5168ae81c940ab7"	HuntShowdown

I believe in you	"Hey guys! So I want to start by saying I share the same ""problem"" as all of you. My penis is small. One thing I want to pass along to you guys, is that there is a way out of the insecurities and lack of confidence. Obviously that's easier said than done. Everyone is different, and everyone's experiences are different, but for me, I have always 1.) strived to make sure that my oral (as in my speaking, not my sex) skills with women are prime, 2.) my oral (yup, sex) skills with women are prime, 3.) paying attention to what a woman's body language is telling you before/during sex, and I think most importantly 4.) just owning that shit from the get go. If penis talk comes up, I just tell it how it is ""yup, I have like a 3 inch penis"" ""I've got a small dick so"" I own that shit. And at first it's weird and embarrassing, but then you start realizing that once you have owned your insecurity. Damn does it lose that control over you. For me, I have had very positive sexual experiences using my small penis. I think the adage of ""it's not the size of the boat"" is a very true thing to an extent, and as long as you believe in yourself - AS I DO - you can break the shackles! Let's change the world, one small penis at time guys. Love you all!"	smalldickproblems

The Mother God heresy, and view of gender in Lutheranism	I saw that we are in agreement on this subreddit that the Mother God thing in ELCA is heresy. We've also had some discussion of gender here, particularly in a thread I started about a week ago, but I still have some questions. Since it's established in Scripture that God is male, Jesus is male, the disciples were all male, and the apostles/teachers are all male, I've made the controversial argument before here that women need male intermediaries. At most times, this has gotten downvoted, especially by women. But last night, it did finally get upvoted when I explained that I'd rather err on the side of reducing women's roles than ascribing to God any woman traits, in reference to the Mother God thing. It seems we need to establish more understanding and agreement on where gender should apply, and shouldn't apply, in the faith. There was also a lack of consensus on how much the wife should subscribe to the husband's denomination, such as in the recent dating thread. What takes precedence, a woman's submission to the husband, or correct doctrine? This question is very pertinent in the cases where the husband believes in symbolic communion and is in one of the non-Lutheran denominations, while the wife is in LCMS. Sure, we can always say, don't get involved in those unions, but I've seen more than a few threads here in the last few months on Lutherans who are involved with the opposite sex in other denominations, so we can't just sweep it under the rug. It exists. Finally, being female myself, I've had to accept over the years that it's better to place my trust in the hands of men than in what I think. Since God is male, it's awkward to pray to Him since I'm female. I like the liturgy, where I'm assured I'm praying something a male has established. So I rarely pray alone. I'm not even that comfortable singing hymns in church as women are supposed to be silent in the churches per Scripture, so I just whisper them. There's been debate over whether or not I used the correct word in saying women had less 'access' to God, but whatever the case, there do seem to be a number of gender distinctions in Scripture, and I'd rather err on the side of giving women a reduced role than give us too much. If that means I require male intermediaries between me and God, then I accept it.	LCMS

How do I access a China-only website from outside of China?	This time, it's not using a VPN from within China to access Western websites; it's the other way around, but I didn't find much tutorials on how to do that. Are there VPNs with servers in Mainland China? P.S. It's for someone I know. They want to access a local government's website.	China

39 [M4F] Looking for my best friend who is also my soulmate/lover....	**About Me:** Hi, I am 39 currently residing in Texas, single. I like to play board/video games as well as binge-watch shows and movies. I like to go window shopping as well as to the park and lake sometimes and enjoy getting out of the house from time to time but prefer to stay home most days. I love anything from Arts Drawings, paintings, abstracts, 3d graphics. Crafts (More of do it yourself type of crafts.) I love going to flea markets as well as yard sales, museums, fairs, and amusement parks. I love music of all types from oldies to alternative to today's pop/rock. I love history and learning about history, especially from the medieval era. I also love to go camping and fishing as well as archery and many other things. *I care more about who a person is, rather than what they look like or weigh or what health issues they have. I care more about how I click with the person and what we have in common and the persons personality.* This is important and looking for someone who is kind of the same way. **What I Am Looking For:** Someone who is single or divorced, not married, not separated, not in an open relationship or attached but is single and in the USA. Someone who I can eventually settle down with. Be romantic with. who enjoys gaming either it be card games, board games, video games, or just binge watch movies or tv shows. who enjoys the flea markets, parks, lakes, long road trips to nowhere. enjoys slow dancing and snuggling. Someone who is serious and wants to eventually live together and be a real couple. Someone to grow old with and to have a long lasting relationship with. P.S. I been playing World of Warcraft us server horde and would love to find someone who is into that as well.	cf4cf
It hurts to see your name	You pop up everywhere. In casual conversations, in notifications on my phone that I can't bring myself to block, in my thoughts every time I see/hear/experience anything even slightly related to you. I thought this would get easier with time, but it hasn't. Your name still hurts today just as much as it did when we stopped talking two months ago. Two months may not seem like much, but I've never let myself become attached enough to anyone to hurt for more than a day or two. &#x200B; Even after all of the pain you've caused, I still can't bring myself to regret you. You're still my best friend. You're still my brother. You're still someone I would move mountains to protect. I can't hate you or even be angry with you. I can only understand you. Unfortunately, understanding you doesn't make my pain or fear go away. If anything, I think it makes both feelings stronger. &#x200B; I don't know if I'll ever heal enough to talk to you again. If not, I hope you live well. I hope you find the strength and goodness I always saw in you. I hope you conquer your pain and stop doubting yourself, because you are capable of so much. I hope you find friendships as deep and meaningful as ours was once. I hope you find love and happiness and all of the good that this world has to offer. &#x200B; For myself, I only hope that someday I can smile when I see your name. &#x200B; \-M	UnsentLetters
Grade Drop Appeal	Would the current situation with COVID19 be a good reason to appeal to the school council for a delayed class drop? My mother had to go into surgery during this time so I was with her the whole time and couldn't really focus 100% on school work.	UIUC
Is my Miata cursed?	This is the third time this car has broken down on me at the worst possible time, second time that it's left me stranded on the highway. First it was harmonic balancer bolts backing out (probably my fault), then it was the pilot bearing locking up one day into a road trip, and now just when I thought I had everything good to go, a heater hose splits on me on my way to work. I love this little car, but I swear it's just trying to make my life miserable. Ok, rant over. Back to your regularly scheduled programming.	Miata

Any skinny girls with hooded lids?	So a picture of Adele popped up and I saw that she had hooded lids before the weight loss and now you can see her crease and all, she has no hood left. I knew a girl in my high school who was normal weight but on the heavier side and when she lost weight her hood was fully gone and she could apply eye makeup without any bother. I checked other weight transformation pics on Instagram and it's the same with every girl. I am 5'6 and bellow 100lbs atm, I used to be thin all my life, I turned 130lbs in high school and then went thin again. The hood is the exact same, no difference. Anyone else having this? I feel like only me and mature women have hoods when skinny.	Trufemcels
Assassin‚Äôs creed Odyssey not working	I bought in Stadia this game and all I have is a ¬´ Testing connection.... ¬ª screen. No game.. All other games are OK.

[Q] How to look at how many people have won a Pick'Em gold trophy?	"In 2017 I won the trophy: ""Gold Atlanta 2017 Pick'Em Trophy"" and I knew it was pretty rare in that time (Australis won but no one expected it because it was a new team). I won with 75 points and I saw that only 1% got 75 points or more so I knew not many people got it because the requirement for gold was 75points. The only problem is how rare? I have no idea how many people participated in the event or how you can search how many people have won the gold trophy. Do you know how?"	csgomarketforum
Haven't been taking this seriously	Joined NoFap about a week or two ago. Found the name intriguing (While watching nsfw) and clicked on it. Since then I haven't been watching any porn after seeing multiple inspiring posts. Before I found NoFap I thought I was just a bad egg. A one in a million person having 10 seconds of pleasure a day. The porn stopped. But I haven't. Please find some time to motivate me.	NoFap

League should have 2 step verification	"So basically few days ago i was writing to Riot support for unrelated reason and when i logged for the fifth time i realised that if someone will hack into my account i will lost acess to all Riot games. In my opinion to increase security we should have a two step verification. It could be classic e-mail way, sms code (bcs they already have our phone numbers for clash), code in mobile app or even using outside verificator like google authenticator. Many other companies are using these methods and most of them allow to turn off the 2 step verif so it is not irritating for people who don't like it or don't feel they need it. League already have mobile app so they don't need to create new one for it. I contacted the support to ask if they can tell me if Riot is maybe working on it but they told me that becauses Riot didn't mention anything about it they can't ""uncover"" anything."	leagueoflegends

Why isnt ranked language locked?	"In what world is a healthy match promoted by 3 people speaking one language and 2 others speaking another? I just don't get it. Solo tyr loads into lobby with atleast 4 people screaming in their mic in Spanish and build 70% cdr. Mids ""lagging"" at a slick 1 and 16 starting defense and selling completed items twice. We really need to be able to language lock or something. Ping checks are a plus."	Smite

Pandemics are one of the factors for food insecurity	Most people in Brunei have never experienced the fear of going to bed with an empty stomach. Unfortunately, many around the world do not have the same experience. A [study](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/covid-19-could-double-the-number-of-people-on-the-brink-of-starvation/) by the WE Forum estimates that the current pandemic will double the amount of people going without food to 265 million worldwide. Food insecurity does not necessarily mean just having no food, but it can also be when the availability of food is uncertain or sporadic. Shelving funding for food aid and the stay at home orders will deal a hammer blow to food production-with lack of labour- and thus impact food price. During the previous food price crisis,[prices](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/25/impending-global-food-crisis) skyrocketed from 2010 to 2012 and previously in 2006-2008. Can nations that are now in recession cope with feeding their population? With all resources being channelled to fighting the virus, countries that do not have food security will suffer the same fate as in the earlier 2010s.	nasikatok
[Activity] Mindful Monday	It‚Äôs time to set your intentions for the week! What will you do to work mindfulness into each day this week? Mindfulness is the intentional practice of slowing down and being present in the moment. It helps to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. It can include all five senses and some examples are: connecting with nature, aromatherapy, meditation, guided relaxation, yoga, gratitude journaling, relaxation music, and much more!

If the 2 days rollback can't be rollbackbacked ...	Please * Extend the PvP Season by 1 week, or make everything count double for the remaining week (matches for the season rank, wins for achievements ...) * Extend SAB by at least 2 days * Make a double-everything bonus for WvW next week (double WXP - not just the usual 100% call of the mists bonus but a real double after buffs ; double skirmish claim tickets) * Triple the returns per node in home instances tomorrow, especially paid ones. Also send the daily (paid) hunters stuff 3 times. Oh and daily login reward too. ... yes I lost all of that - and more - spent the whole weekend playing. Can't catch the pvp season anymore for example.	Guildwars2
Exercising and intermittent fasting	I‚Äôve being doing IF (16:8) for about four months now. I started running in the afternoons about two months ago. During this time, I had no problems sticking to my windows (eating from 10-6). Now that the weather is getting hot, I‚Äôve switched to running in the morning, which means I am positively ravenous by 8 am. I‚Äôd like to avoid shifting my eating window earlier (I enjoy sharing dinner with my fianc√©e, this is important to me) but man, hunger pangs! Any advice for how to deal with IF while exercising?	intermittentfasting

It's so annoying when people type like 'omgggg did you see thatttt I knnnoooowwww'.	(This is a lame one.) Maybe most adults can't relate with this, and I'm pretty sure this is a preteen-teen thing, but pretty much everyone I know texts like, 'Omggg, thankkkk youuuu Ilyyyyyyy' and it's SO annoying. Better use caps or a bunch of exclamation marks. But please, please for the love of God, don't use dragged letters. It's so pissinggggg offffff (see?). I'm not even talking about an exclamation per se. I'm talking about regular conversations. Maybe something like, 'Did you hear what Sara said about Julie?' and the response goes something like, 'dudeeeee yaaaaa I can't evennnnnnn'. Maybe I'm just weird in that sense, but I end up reading it as 'dudeyyyyyyy'. Hopefully this is a habit people grow out of, because it's frustrating.	unpopularopinion

Looking for recommendations for my sister, a soon-to-be Columbus transplant!	Hello Columbus Redditors! I hope it is ok to post this here. My sister just went through a crappy divorce and decided to take her company up on an offer to relocate to Columbus from Austin. Her move has been delayed due to COVID-19, but she is very nervous to live on her own in a brand new city and I was hoping to get together a list of things she could do when she finally arrives. I am hoping for any and all kinds of activities, food and drink spots she has to try, and any funky local things that go on, the weirder and more colloquial, the better! I‚Äôm an amateur artist and I want to put together a homemade illustrated ‚Äúguide‚Äù for her of outings, spots, activities, and attractions. I would be happy to post a link here when I‚Äôm done if anyone else would like it. I would also love to illustrate any local features/curiosities so those are welcome as well! I just want to give her a way to feel more at home. Of course, if you don‚Äôt want to give away the secrets of your city I understand, but I‚Äôm hoping to at least get some lowdown on spots that won‚Äôt come up in a Google search of ‚Äúbest things to do‚Äù. My sister is single, so she is looking for friends, lovers, and things to do beyond hitting bars (although she will definitely do that a fair amount). I really appreciate any help you can give, thank you for reading! Edit: She is 33, she is very social and will enjoy almost any activity if there are people around. She loves football and baseball and her taste in music is mostly country but if it‚Äôs live music she will enjoy almost anything. She is an incredible singer and loves karaoke. She is pretty active but not super outdoorsy. She loves food, especially Italian. She also loves animals of all kinds and has 2 large dogs.	Columbus

Lucid Sex + Flying + False Awakening	"After a serie of vivid dreams, my alarm rang. And instead of doing a technique, I just went back sleeping because I was lazy. I had a 2 long dreams before being lucid, then I found myself in my bed in darkness. I thought I was awake but I said whatever let's just do a reality check... I plugged my nose and I could breathe through it. I ""woke up"" in my old house, in my room. Then I started rubbing my hands cause my dream was fading away. Then I explored and as I was out of my house, chilling on my terrace, I told myself when I enter my house again, there will be the finest girl from ""Gooba"", you know that 6ix9ine new music vid. I went in and she was there, in my living room. You all know what I did next. No one really talks about these sex experiences, but every frequent lucid dreamer (which I'm not) had them. Well, anyway the sex didn't really seem real except for the orgasm which was so great, and in the morning, I had the sperm in my pants. Next thing I did was leave my house. I wanted to fly but I had never done it before. I also wanted to talk to my subconscious by interacting with dream characters, but no one was there. So I decided to fly. And I had it first try. I jumped, then I flew off. It was so incredible. I could see my native island. It was the same, until there was a part that my mind created. It was a Savannah. Without really controling it, I landed there. There were lots of elephants and other animals. Seconds after I landed, a Lion was trying to attack me. He was dangerously close to me. I took off just before it had me and was so amazed at all I had experienced Last thing that happened was my dad waking me up. He's not even in the same country I am but it didn't seem to surprise me. I was upset and told him he ruined my lucid dream. He told me I had things to do and he couldn't wait for me to wake up. Then, I woke up for good and still was upset, but this time for not realising I was still in a dream. Do a reality check everytime you wake up, this won't happen to you. Ps: During this dream, I had this problem with my eyes. Sometimes I could open both, but most of it, only my right eye was barely opened. It made my vision blurry, no matter how much I stabilized the dream. I still had a great time. But if someone knows anything about this, let me know thanks !"	LucidDreaming

I'm at a loss	Probably should be posting this in /r/relationships but here goes: I want to break up with my current girlfriend. For months now. While I'm happy with our relationship, the fights that we have are unbearable. It usually starts with something minor that I did (taking something I suggested as ordering her around, playful teasing, hell even the playful banters evolve into full blown fights). The thing with these fights is that she's big on amends. She wants me to make up in some way and until I do, she treats me more or less like trash. I think that over the times that this happened, i eventually lost interest in genuinely making amends and just resort to saying whatever just to appease her. Which is not me. And now, it's taking a toll with my mental health. We've been together for over a year, there's been ups and downs, and somehow during those down times I've convinced myself that things will get better. That we'll both be mature enough to deal with arguments better. But it didn't. It's always me having to patch up things with her. Sure, it's all fun when we're not fighting, but when we do, I feel less and less in love with her. But i don't know how to breakup with her. I know that if I do, she'll self-harm, or worse, kill herself. I just know she'll do it. She has issues that I don't think I can help with alone. Being the only reason for her to go on in life isn't good for her either. So yeah, I'm at a loss.	CasualPH

Within a few days they had gotten back to me asking for a shipping address, and sent out a brand new folder. Total time between first contacting them and having the new folder in hand was about a week. Really impressed with this quality of customer service."	gundealsFU

The Next Covid Crisis Could Be a Wave of Suicides	The isolation, grief and economic hardship related to Covid-19 are creating a mental health crisis in the U.S. that researchers warn could make the already-rising suicide rate worse. A study [released Friday](https://wellbeingtrust.org/) tried to quantify the toll. The paper, which was not peer-reviewed, found that over the next decade as many as 75,000 additional people could die from ‚Äúdeaths of despair‚Äù as a result of the coronavirus crisis, a term that refers to suicides and substance-abuse-related deaths. The research was done by the Well Being Trust and researchers affiliated with the American Academy of Family Physicians. ‚ÄúI hope in 10 years people look back and say, ‚ÄòWow, they way overestimated it,‚Äô‚Äù said John Westfall, director of the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care, who co-wrote the report. Even as the American economy rebounded after the last recession, suicides and overdoses cut into Americans‚Äô life expectancy. Mental health experts worry that the economic uncertainty and social isolation of the pandemic will make things worse at a time when the health care system is already overwhelmed.

Gillette Guard for head shaving (any alternatives?)	Hi all! I've been shaving my head for years, and I recently heard about the Gillette Guard razor. It sounds right up my alley, however I live in Canada and have yet to find a source for them. eBay has them of course, but they would have ran me almost 70 bucks and shipping would likely be over a month or more. Where could a Canadian go to track these down? Amazon doesn't have them either. Alternatively, is there anything out there that is a good 2nd choice in the absence of the Guard? Something of a similar nature that is more easily found on this continent?	wicked_edge
Passed SAA-CO1 (889/1000) - What Now?	Edit: Thank you Jon for the amazing practice exams :) You are a god **Materials Used:** Acloudguru, Whizlabs, Jon Bonso Practice Exams, Tutorialdojo Passed on 5/8/20; 2.5 months on-off studying (passed CCP 2 weeks in); no Computer Science background or experience **Exam Review:** The exam was definitely a bit easier than Jon's and Whizlab's practice exams. My test was heavy on EC2 & EBS (14 questions), KMS & different types of encryption (7-8), S3 (probably 8 questions), RDS (6-7),SQS (4+) and VPCs (12+ questions). Oh, and a bunch of really tricky Cloudfront & ELB questions peppered in. There were 4 nearly identical questions about VPC endpoints as well. I found that Jon's & Whizlabs question explanations were perhaps the most pragmatic way to study before sitting the exam alongside tutorial dojo. Whizlab's questions were up to par, but their explanations sometimes fell short in comparison to Jon's. I was getting mid 80s on both practice sets before sitting the exam. ACG's course did not provide anywhere near enough information and was presented as a high level overview. I found that their course wasn't well put together (many misspellings & mess ups) However, having access to their entire platform with different cloud tutorials sparked curiosity in other areas of cloud computing. **ONVUE:** How on earth have they not figured this out yet. I tried taking the exam early April and sat watching myself being recorded for nearly two hours. I felt my soul leave my body after 45 mins. I eventually gave up and my money was refunded. Second time around it was only a 30 minute self-stare. It almost feels like they are performing a social experiment which tries to see how long people will wait. Without speaking to a proctor, my exam began. I wasn't worried because I saw that this had happened to others on this subreddit. halfway through this guy named Sean abruptly chatted me up, saying that I had to refrain from speaking or miming the words which was super upsetting. I said sorry and he disappeared. Just a reminder that they are watching. **What Now?** So after all that build up for studying for the exam, I'm at a fork in the road and don't know which direction to take. I have a remote internship working with AWS for a company from June - July, and I want to get more practical skills under my belt before it commences. I've recently enrolled in Harvard's CS50 free course online to gain some foundational computer science skills, but I don't know if this is where I should be spending my time. I want to explore more of what cloud has to offer. Should I go for Sysops or devops? Is it really pertinent seeing that they overlap so much? Or should I learn a tangential skill like coding fundamentals? Or something else?	AWSCertifications

Day 1	So I've pretty much jacked off everyday since I was 12 (I'm now 18), and about a year ago I started noticing that I could only get hard from porn. I took a two week break and was able to get boners without porn again, but unfortunately I went back to using porn every day. I've taken roughly two week breaks 4 times now, and they always work for getting my boners back, but after that the temptation is too strong, and I go back to using porn and then only being able to get hard from porn. I'm writing here because I want this break to last, hopefully forever. I figure if I write this on this page I will be more likely to stick to my goal. Thanks. Also, what would you guys say is the chance of me sticking to this goal? (for at least 3 months)	NoFap

Railjack Universal Vacuum should be the standard across the game	\*With the exception of active gameplay drops (ammo pickups, orbs, etc) &#x200B; Losing out on loot because you didn't see it or you weren't fast enough to pick it up before the mission is over feels pretty bad overall. &#x200B; Stuff like Resources, Parts, Blueprints, and other such things which have value outside of a mission should be automatically picked up for every player participating in that mission, or at the very least, there should be some kind of loot preservation system (Like Destiny's Postmaster, for example) &#x200B; Imagine you have been trying to get that one last Brakk part from the G3 for months, you are doing a defense mission and they invade almost at the end of it, your squad kills one of them, doesn't mark the drop, and you aren't aware that part you wanted was in a corner of the map until you notice there's something you didn't grab, it could be the part you are looking for, it could be something else, you rush to it but the mission ends and the part was just barely outside your companion's vacuum range. Too bad, best luck next time, right? &#x200B; I don't really understand why it has to be like this, I sort of understand the affinity range in ground missions, I believe that's alright, specially with how some abilities rely on affinity range instead of their own range value, if Universal Vacuum is good for Railjack, why not for the rest of the game? &#x200B; If there really is a good argument against universal vacuum on ground missions, why not a Loot Preservation System instead? &#x200B; Imagine you go to Maroo's Bazaar and she offers to sell back to you the loot you missed out on the last few missions you ran, maybe she's been tailing you this entire time, Tenno leave lots of valuable things behind after they completely destroy everything in their path, Tenno can't just pay attention to every shiny little thing that falls on the floor, that's where Maroo comes in, she cleans up after the Tenno storms through missions and as part of her service, she can return what you missed for a small fee! (credits, endo, resources, etc), that way, you won't miss out on that one thing you needed and couldn't help but leave behind.	Warframe
I feel like this comment summarized my problems with current Beastars pretty well.	"Credit to u/that1trainsguy ‚ÄúThis has always been one of my biggest nitpicks with Paru's writing, and I guess now's a good time to bring it up: from Chapter 140 onwards, her worldbuilding went in a direction which I personally found myself trapped in when I tried to do it - I became so involved with the motifs of the narrative I was trying to paint, with all the little tidbits of it, with all the (ultimately pointless) trivia that I forgot to tell a compelling story, or even a story at all. The dialogue went from high schoolers or individuals of that age navigating an increasingly dark and hostile world to a messy pastiche of tropes and wikipedia-like soundbytes explaining the most minute and irrelevant details of the world. And as this happened, the story devolved from a believable set of circumstances which, despite their overbearingly nightmarish grimness, weighed down the protagonist in a way that wasn't utterly overwhelming to a mess of grimdark nonsense. By this point, we're so far down the hole of grimdarkness that it's hard to see any chance of happiness for either Legosi or any of the deuteragonists. Even Jack, Legosi's childhood best friend, the vehicle for fluffy and gentle moments which serve as some sort of redeeming patch of light in the unbearable darkness of the world of Beastars have vanished in favour of a narrative of obedience and servility in different types of canines. It felt absurdly shoehorned in, as if every part of warmth had been sucked out of the setting. Even the grimmest, darkest, most bleak setting has some level of comfort for the protagonists. Otherwise, we're privy to a torture story. It's as if Paru's characters are becoming less themselves as individuals, with their own quirks, behaviours, and personalities, and more vehicles for broader ideas pertaining to this vastly layered society and its structure, which is an absurdly double-edged sword. Without said characters, we can't even explain half the ideas which she throws at us because there's no vehicle to do so. It comes down to a sort of Flanderisation, only less about reducing the characters to a singular trope within themselves, and more about reducing them to the defiance of the stereotypes imposed upon them. And I want to make this absolutely clear: none of what I said is a bad thing. It is entirely possible to write an inescapably grim but compelling story where the main characters are in a state of constant, inexorable anguish, and where their ends are known. However, those stories are made great by additions of some manner of hopefulness, some manner of humanity, something relatable. Paru's writing has rendered even Legosi and Haru's relationship from an expression of ultimate gentleness in a cruel world and a triumph of deep intimacy over instinct into...this incredibly bland, flat series of arguments about the same old things: ""instinct"", ""predation"", ""fetishism"", and so on, and so forth. They no longer talk like a real couple, there's no reason for them to be together anymore because they don't interact outside of their ""do we have sex to defy our natures"" dynamic. Louis is slowly becoming the most compelling character because he's less concerned with saving the world - or rather, becoming an instrument to save the world - and more of an ego-driven individual who actually wants and needs something. And I can't believe that's the case because we've now arrived at a complete inversion of how the situation was initially. At this point, if Haru and Legosi got together and lived happily ever after, Melon finally got his shit kicked in (jesus christ god almighty what is taking so long, what are you building up to), and we could turn the story to someone actually compelling, I'd be thrilled. God, give me the story of Sebun's first interracial romance. Give me the story of Juno and Louis realising they don't owe this world shit. Give me any level of catharsis, anything beyond another thousand fucking paragraphs of wikipedia-like bullshit about whales saving the world or the Beastar being an asshole. In closing, Beastars keep going larger. And it keeps stretching itself thinner. And I don't see it ending well, frankly.‚Äù"	Beastars

Need to build a computer for the Sims.	"I've been building forever. I even have all the blinky lights. 3800x, 1080ti etc. I've overclocked, done graphite mods on processors, custom water cooled rigs, you name it. Now I need to do a ""budget build"" and have no idea where to start. The only requirement is it must play the Sims well. Will on board (I even hate saying it) graphics be enough? I'm assuming amd if using on board stuff. Building a pc for the price of my cpu seems ridiculous to me, and I end up using ""good parts"" and going over. I could use a hand finding the quality at the bottom. Can it be done under $400?"	buildapc
Pure Madra path benefits	I was thinking about different paths and it got me thinking that so far we haven't see that many benefits of a pure madra path or any particular reason Eithan would choose one. Benefits: * Easy on the channels allowing a lot of madra to be put into techniques * Has a soothing effect on Lindons channels after blackflame * Powerful for nullifying striker techniques Drawbacks: * No ruler technique/weak to ruler techniques * Doesn't have the best enforcer techniques (although Eithan says this Lindons seems pretty good) * Doesn't have much in the way of attacks (Either shatter their core with a striker technique or disrupt them a bit, no inbetween) * No defensive capabilities apart from striker attacks From Uncrowned it seems that the Aurelius clan specialises in storm and lightning based paths matched with their extraordinary sight; Eithan who gives the impression of being a long lost scion from the Aurelius main line seems to be on a weaker path. Obviously most of Lindon's focus has been on blackflame but he would be a shadow of the sacred artist he is if he only had a pure path. While Eithan is a very powerful underlord that seems to be down to his iron body, large core and excellent command over bloodline powers rather than his path at all, arguably he would be a lot more successful with a different path. So it got me thinking that pure madra might be more of a 'late game build' while BlackFlames are a deadly threat at copper maybe Pure madra paths don't start seeing their benefits until Archlord+. The counterpoint being that none of the higher advancements seem too fussed about his path or future advancement. Could be because I'm blatantly wrong or maybe there hasn't been a pure madra sage/herald so people aren't aware.	Iteration110Cradle

My father constantly controlls my life and life choices	"I'm male 17 and my father constantly controlls my life choices like what high school should I go to,what job would i work and I really can't go on like this.It destroys every ounce of respect I have for him.2 years ago when I had to choose what High School I should go to he made me go to a school I didn't want or like (car electrician),I said 2 other schools I wanted to go to but he wouldn't even listen he litteraly dragged me to go to that school,and when my mother says that he made me go to that school he gets offended and defensive saying that we are lying.But this thing happened today.I always loved learning languages and I already know a few languages (my native,English,German,a fair bit of Russian) and about a week ago I started learning Japanese (because since I can remember I always loved Japan and I always wanted to travel there and hopefully live there one day) and he called me on the phone and asked what am I doing,so I said learning Japanese for the next 30 minutes he was lecturing me how much useless I am,how I will never accomplish anything in my life,how retarded I am because I am learning that amount of Languages and when he finished his lecturing he said ""I don't care it's your life you are gonna destroy not mine"" and hanged up.That destroyed me,that litteraly destroyed me.I don't know what to do,I was thinking of running away from home but I don't have anywhere else to go.I need some help."	helpme

What is personally your favorite TOP lane match-up and why?	I can't stop smiling like an absolutely idiot while facing off against Riven players. I love the simplicity of her, the easy combo's you can follow, the mitigation of her damage when you blind her stun duration, and taking grasp to freely poke her every 4 seconds for a stack and healing. She isn't played all that much anymore due to her being pretty shit in comparison to other top laners, but she never ceases to make me happy.	TeemoTalk

Crazy neighbor thinks my dad wants to date her	Okay, she's not exactly entitled, but this story deserves to be here. Here's a little backstory first: My mom and dad have been married for at least 20 years, and my dad continually says my mom is the love of his life.My mom doesn't like to talk to this specific neighbor because she's rude, and fake. Anyways, here's the story. (I was told this story, I didn't witness it) Basically, my mom hates this neighbor. She (neighbor) was actually rude to me and my sibling (she literally closes the door in our faces, never says thank you, etc.) So, my dad recently had an encounter with her, in which he called her by the wrong name. Somehow, she turned it into him liking her?! Idk. She's weird. So, she tells this to another neighbor (he's pretty nice, and he knows why my mom doesn't talk to this lady) And he sent my mom an email about it. In her mind, she thinks that my mom doesn't talk to her because my mom is jealous. The nerve (if you could even call it that) of some people.	EntitledPeople

Well fuck. Priorities.	This is an update to [my previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/f9dzxe/13_years_keep_chickening_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Apparently pandemics have a way of putting things into perspective. Wife (LL) and I (HL) are quarantined separately, thank god. We know we would kill each other if we were in the same house. But you know what happened when we couldn‚Äôt have access to each other? Shit got sexy again. Honestly I don‚Äôt even know how this works but I‚Äôm blown away. Reading my last post is like going into a time machine. My brain Is so scrambled I cannot believe the difference a few months make. The past 50+ days have been so off the wall and also incredibly mundane at the same time, but they have provided the oddest most productive foundation for some priorities to align. First of all, let‚Äôs address the regained ‚Äúbedroom:‚Äù Due to her health issues, we are forced to stay apart for the time being. (I know in my prior post I had mentioned moving out, which is true, but I‚Äôm quarantined in yet another different place for a number of reasons) Yes, this means our sexytimes are via phone/Facetime. But even so, this is literally some of the hottest shit I have ever heard or felt. She has INITIATED, MORE THAN ONCE. Like... full blown tells me to do NSFW things to her and stuff. This has been a major confidence boost for me. I still have some confidence issues due to constantly getting refused or deflected for so long, but it‚Äôs way better now. It‚Äôs seriously a world of difference when your partner fucking *wants* you. As far as us having fundamental differences, that is still 100% true. Neither of us thinks living together is a good idea. But if this pandemic has acted as some kind of wake up call about our romantic involvement, then so be it. We both understand the deep connection we have just on a person-to-person level. I never thought it would be a problem still be attracted to each other and love each other even as a ‚Äúseparated couple,‚Äù but that was apparently her biggest road block and thus caused her to shut down sexually before. But now that we are actually forced into this situation, she must have come to some kind of understanding of not taking me for granted or some such thing. I don‚Äôt actually know what happened to be honest. All I know is that we miss each other like crazy and that from the moment she actually admitted that she wished we could hop into bed together, all bets were off. Now for the changes on my end: I have to admit that I have come into an even greater understanding of the health issues she faces now more than ever. Her illness has absolutely played a role in the previous demise of our bedroom and I don‚Äôt think I gave it enough credit before. She has a severe autoimmune disease and as of these past couple months is on heavy medications and completely immunosuppressed. These new meds she just started taking at the beginning of the pandemic and they kick her ass every week. So some of this has needed to come around to my understanding of her experience and just how exhausted she is all the time. It sucks because while I understood some of her pain before, I didn‚Äôt know it could get this bad. And now I‚Äôm just wishing I could do more for her to feel better but there‚Äôs not much that I can do besides emotionally. That being said, I am a lot more considerate of her needs, yet simultaneously we have more ‚Äúsex‚Äù now than we have had in the past year even though she feels worse in general. Btw, lest I sound like a dick, I do not push or pressure her in any way shape or form. It‚Äôs completely up to her what she is up for. The sex is specifically because she is into it. Our communication has become more focused because we aren‚Äôt distracted by other things too. So if she is too tired, she might also add that she *would* want to talk dirty if she were physically up for it. Which is great because then I at least know that she wants to be with me. But in reality she probably needs to sleep. To reciprocate on my end, that could look like me sending her a nice voice memo of some sexytimes and then she can crack it open for a listen when she is ready. Btw, I highly recommend trying that out. It‚Äôs a great way to be expressive and get your rocks off if the relationship is a little too strained for in-person contact, and if your partner is open to receiving something like that then they might find themselves even more turned on than they thought. Who knows. We have talked briefly about whether or not a divorce should be in the works. Mostly we are both way too stressed out with this pandemic for any of that to matter. And with the newly rekindled ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù there may be no use for it. Ultimately as far as the relationship itself, and on a heavy note, I can‚Äôt see myself not being the one to take care of her. As I watch her health decline it scares me. I don‚Äôt have any interest in ‚Äúfreeing‚Äù myself of this relationship just to go try and find someone and go through the work of getting to know each other. That sounds exhausting and wrong. I don‚Äôt want someone else. I want HER to continue to know me and want me. Not only that but even more importantly, I don‚Äôt think I could live with myself if something really serious happened with her health and I couldn‚Äôt be there. I want to be here. I just want it to not be a continuation of the dumb push-pull cycle (mentioned in previous post). Right now it feels pretty different and I don‚Äôt know if that is a fundamental change that the pandemic has caused or if it‚Äôs just circumstances. She has fully owned that she legit wants me, not just on the phone. We social distance visited and she told me she wanted to rip my clothes off so there‚Äôs that lol. At the end of The day if she is okay with being ‚Äúseparate together‚Äù as a bottom line then I‚Äôm okay with it. As long as we can reunite at some point, FFS who knows when that‚Äôll happen. Anyway, TL;DR: My wife (LL) and I (HL) were on the verge of divorce after a very DB and lots of conflict but then this pandemic happened, forcing us to isolate separately, and then we missed each other and she started initiating phone sex and it turned out to be insanely hot. So now sex is back on the table and maybe the divorce is off the table but who knows? Let‚Äôs hope.	DeadBedrooms

It hurts to see your name	You pop up everywhere. In casual conversations, in notifications on my phone that I can't bring myself to block, in my thoughts every time I see/hear/experience anything even slightly related to you. I thought this would get easier with time, but it hasn't. Your name still hurts today just as much as it did when we stopped talking two months ago. Two months may not seem like much, but I've never let myself become attached enough to anyone to hurt for more than a day or two. &#x200B; Even after all of the pain you've caused, I still can't bring myself to regret you. You're still my best friend. You're still my brother. You're still someone I would move mountains to protect. I can't hate you or even be angry with you. I can only understand you. Unfortunately, understanding you doesn't make my pain or fear go away. If anything, I think it makes both feelings stronger. &#x200B; I don't know if I'll ever heal enough to talk to you again. If not, I hope you live well. I hope you find the strength and goodness I always saw in you. I hope you conquer your pain and stop doubting yourself, because you are capable of so much. I hope you find friendships as deep and meaningful as ours was once. I hope you find love and happiness and all of the good that this world has to offer. &#x200B; For myself, I only hope that someday I can smile when I see your name. &#x200B; \-M	UnsentLetters
CD Projekt Red, Cyberpunk 2077 & Baldur's Gate Kazuliski	"Previously I have alluded to the fact that Baldur‚Äôs Gate essentially laid the foundations for what CDPR would become today. Without Baldur‚Äôs Gate its conceivable there would be no Witcher or Cyberpunk 2077. Baldur‚Äôs Gate would also be responsible for introducing me to CD Projekt back in the summer of 2000. So, how did a D&D game that was developed by Bioware and published in 1998 by Interplay Entertainment, help establish the RPG powerhouse that is CD Projekt Red? In the early nineties, it was almost impossible to get hold of games in Poland, legal ones that is, although Polish copyright law was non-existent. Marcin Iwi≈Ñski, Vice President and co-founder of CD PROJEKT, would fortuitously fail to qualify for a computer course he wanted to take in high school, forcing him to study mathematical physics. In this class, he would meet future business partner, Michal Kici≈Ñski, who at the time was selling bootleg Atari games. Serendipitously, CD-ROM‚Äôs were becoming ubiquitous. Being able to fit the data from hundreds of floppy discs onto one CD was a game changer, particularly in Poland. Thus in 1994, Marcin, would create CD Projekt. The business was essentially two guys in a room of a friends flat. Marcin would comment that ""Our main competition here in Poland was always pirates."" The national stadium in Warsaw, was home to Eastern Europe's largest flea market, and was Poland's largest exporter of counterfeit goods, games and music. Pirated copies of games would usually be available for ¬£3, roughly 48 hours after release. But what if CD Projekt could convince people to buy a legitimate copy instead? Marcin had an idea. ""We made the biggest bet back in the day: we wanted Baldur's Gate."" Iwinski developed a relationship with game publisher Interplay and began networking with game companies and attending events around the world. In one case, he met BioWare founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk and pitched them on localizing the popular RPG *Baldur's Gate* for Polish audiences. BioWare agreed, with one caveat, CDPR would have to do all the work. ""We said we'd take the risk,"" says Iwinski. ""Of course, the decision was very hard for us. We worked six months on the localization. I was working on it. My father was helping, because he was a producer on movies at the studios that employed famous Polish actors. This was a game that established totally new standards. He knew it would be popular in Poland because it was an awesome game. At the time, Polish gamers were more familiar with Russian, than the English language, so having a Polish localisation of a game that relied heavily on text would be a boon. It cost ¬£30,000 to licence 3000 copies from Interplay, and localisation cost the same again. Then there was marketing, physical production and hiring Polish actors. Notable talent included Krzysztof Kowalewski, Piotr Fronczewski, Wiktor Zborowski, Marian Opania and Jan Kobuszewski, amongst others. Baldur's Gate cost ¬£30 when it came out, which was expensive for Poland. Iwi≈Ñski was hoping consumers would be prepared to pay that much for something special. A regular game in Poland was selling at the time circa 1,000 or 2,000 units. On day one they sold 18,000 units of *Baldur's Gate*."" CD Projekt was subsequently forced to rent a separate warehouse just to hold copies of *Baldur's Gate* before it shipped. The game ended up selling over 100 thousand copies ‚Äì a new record, and thus CD Projekt was firmly established. The success paved the way for further distribution agreements and would convince Marcin that CD Projekt should attempt making their own IP. And thus, they turned to a relatively unknown fantasy series of novels and short stories, written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, about a Witcher called Geralt of Rivia.

[Q] How to look at how many people have won a Pick'Em gold trophy?	"In 2017 I won the trophy: ""Gold Atlanta 2017 Pick'Em Trophy"" and I knew it was pretty rare in that time (Australis won but no one expected it because it was a new team). I won with 75 points and I saw that only 1% got 75 points or more so I knew not many people got it because the requirement for gold was 75points. The only problem is how rare? I have no idea how many people participated in the event or how you can search how many people have won the gold trophy. Do you know how?"	csgomarketforum

Flare-up of chronic health condition - prayer request.	Hello all. May I please request prayer for a health condition I've got (auto-immune lichen schlerosus) as it has flared up really badly recently and now looks terrible. Painful too. I'm worried because I've had it for a long time and there is a possibility of it turning malignant as time goes on. My doctor is phoning me tomorrow morning (they are only doing phone consultations initially because of the covid-19 crisis). I just hope that she will agree to see me in person as it really does need looking at. I've been so anxious & isolated and this is the last thing I need. Thanks!	PrayerRequests

New to Apex in S4, got 10 wins with each legend (stats and hopefully new player guide)	I am not good, let‚Äôs start there. I‚Äôm 42 dad with 3 kids but I wanted to get into apex to play w some friends. Everyone talks mains but I never stick w 1 character so decided to do them all. Hopefully this helps other new players decide who is ‚Äúeasier?‚Äù To start with. Win rate from best to worst and a quick new player opinion. Wide mix of ranked/pubs, 50/50 solo or in a group. 1.Pathfinder- I got the hang of his grapple pretty quick (probably from other games I‚Äôve played) and once I did wow he is so fun and strong. Imo he‚Äôs the best and a must have on every team 2. Gibby- Perfect new player legend, brings so much to the table. 3. Crypto- I‚Äôll be upfront, I watched a bunch of videos prior to playing him. He was so fun to use but unless you wanna put in time to be good with him he‚Äôs really tough to play for new players (I definitely hurt my team when I first started) 4. Revenant (after buff)- Another really good new player legend imo. Use the totem going into every fight, pretty straight forward, if you get off a bunch of damage push if not quick heal and go again 5. Caustic - Started slow but really started hitting many wins once I got a hang of his kit. Very fun to use and great for a new player that might not have positioning down 6. Bang- Good legend for new players, speed boost to get out of trouble with smoke and ult to help you position. (Just please don‚Äôt shoot the smoke at the enemy, smoke yourself to get away and heal) 7. Watson- Being able time block out some areas and eat grenades definitely won me a few games. Wasn‚Äôt a quick learn though by any means 8. Mirage - I love the decoys man, won me so many 1v1 fights. Also really good when looting boxes or figuring out where the heck you got shot from. 9. Wraith- I know how great she is but I just didn‚Äôt pick up that style quickly, the difference between an ok and good Wraith is huge. 10. Bloodhound- Great to know where people are but the ult is just not for me, too jarring of a screen change. Also I felt like people learned to react to his tactical. 11. Lifeline (played her after nerf). I don‚Äôt like support anyways and that seems to be the only thing she brings to table. It was a struggle. 12. Octane - I put up good kill games with him but just struggled to win.

Successfully resisted urges	Yep I did it. By the time of writing this post, this is around the second or third time I genuinely resisted an urge and thought things through before anything. This habit doesn't serve me anymore. Though it feels fine in the moment, the disappointment I'd feel in myself if I were to relapse is stronger than that. It feels good knowing I choose to do the right thing even though the opportunity was right in front of me. I think this is a huge step towards my goal, and I hope that everyone works hard to achieve theirs too :) Be safe, friends.	NoFap
my parents consider me as a gifted kid, here's my story	my mom used to tell me that a doctor told her that i was a gifted child, and that was mostly true for the rest fo my life, i get very high grades in biology, physics, and math, i can solve some problems quickly and so on, im still bad at other subjects like language or history, people that i know (relatives, freinds, etc) tell me im intelligent, the only downside is that im not very social, i get bullied a lot and i dont have that many freinds irl, only some freinds on discord. if anyone shares the same experiences please let me know, goodbye.

How to get an ISTP to do stuff	(Fellow ISTPs, feel free to add things in the comments) We‚Äôre not that difficult if you understand us tbh. Stop begging/pressuring us to do things. MAKE us want to do them. We‚Äôre extremely attracted to emotionally independent people, and we love relationship confidence. The more you allow us to be ourselves and make our own decisions, the more we will love you. **EXAMPLES:** Instead of: ‚ÄúHow was your day? :)‚Äù Try: ‚ÄúCocoa puffs is the superior cereal. CMV.‚Äù Instead of: ‚ÄúI really want you to come spend time with me at my parents house :( ‚Äú Try: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go to my parents and attempt to bake this pie. It would be awesome if you could come help me, but no pressure‚Äù Instead of: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs really hurtful that you never come to my parents house with me :(‚Äú Try: ‚ÄúHey, next week can you stop by my parents house with me for an hour or two so they aren‚Äôt worried about us? When they haven‚Äôt seen you in a while, they start to ask me 20 questions about our relationship and Jr stresses me out..‚Äù Instead of: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you text me all day? Are you not happy with me? :(‚Äú Try: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never gonna believe what happened just now‚Äù **WHEN AN ISTP IS BEING DISTANT:** *Do not:* Go crazy and take it personal. PLEASE don‚Äôt pressure or guilt us into talking, being affectionate, or hanging out until we‚Äôre done recharging. *Do:* Wait patiently for our relationship-y side to recharge, and stay connected to us by showing us how you‚Äôre entertaining yourself while we‚Äôre away. Show us that you‚Äôre *okay* when we‚Äôre in our bubble, and you‚Äôre confident enough in the relationship to know that when we‚Äôre charged back up, you‚Äôre the first person we‚Äôre going to. **WHEN TO TALK TO AN ISTP:** When we‚Äôre being distant for longer than 2-3 weeks. This usually means there‚Äôs a problem in the relationship. Prepare for a breakup, or to learn that ISTP isn‚Äôt fully happy with you.	istp
What did I do wrong here?	"I've been reflecting recently on encounters I had with girls before the lockdown and what I could have done better. This one - in February - I never really understood. I was in a club and a Spanish girl approached me and said ""you're here again? I remember you - you said you work for [employer]"". I didn't remember her at all, but assume I probably briefly spoke to her on a previous night out when drunk. Anyway, we went to the bar and I bought her a drink. We danced then went and chatted outside. She started being all self-depreciating saying she just works in a low paid job and has bad English. I cheekily said ""no, no - eres... inteligente!"" and she burst out laughing. I got her number and we then went on 2 dates to bars and restaurants. She was pretty flirty and laughed a lot. She texted after the 1st date ""I loved meeting you. You are very funny"". Prior to our 2nd date sent a winky faced text. On the 2nd date got me to touch her bra and made a lot of sexual references and innuendo. Anyway, I invited her round mine for dinner on the 3rd date. All seemed to be going well - she enjoyed the meal, we had some wine, sat close to each other on the sofa, and she seemed in a very good mood. Then I went for the kiss and she was like ""what are you doing?"" Then she said, in a baffled tone, ""you want me to kiss you?!"" I asked why can't she kiss me. She replied ""Que??"" (What??) It all then went very awkward as I tried to put into google translate (my Spanish is worse than her english) that I was confused as to why she would come on several dates with me if she didn't like me. She then went home. Recently she's started texting me again this week during lockdown, asking how I'm doing. I'm doubtful as to whether keeping the conversation going will be worth it since she wasted my time so much back in February. I don't really understand her behaviour? Surely if you're a girl and you meet a guy in a club, he subsequently invites you round for dinner on the 3rd date, why would you then act baffled and reject him when he tries to kiss you?"	seduction

I caught up with this wonderful series this past week	"Men what an amazing journey! I watched the first episodes of the anime and got interested, especially because I read this was like Hunter X Hunter, but I honestly think its more similar to Tokyo Ghoul, a manga I really love and Kaneki is very similar to Baam as well. I liked the first season, but things start up getting so much better with Jue Viole Grace and the introduction of Wagnan who's a character I didn't expect I would enjoy reading about. There were many great moments: - The meeting of Rak with Baam and finding out he was really alive. - The date of Endorsi and Baam. - Khun using tactics and intelligence to carry fights is just amazing. - FInding more about the families, I absolutely LOVED MASCHENY and ASENSIO in the data world, they were so incredibly badass against Jahad. And Eduan Khun is a character I also enjoyed a lot. - Ehwa is a great character I loved seeing but sad she can't appear because her flames are hard to draw :( - Hwaryun is another great character, love how chill and smart she is, has the answers for everything and when caught up lying she's like ""Yup I lied, congrats on finding out, now can we move on?"". A small thing I really like is how she considers Baam her GOD, that line ""Who am I to question the decisions of my God? If he wants to save his master I will follow him"" or something like that, it felt badass. - Jinsung Ha is a character I didn't expect to love so much either, he also thinks of Baam as his God, I can't wait to see the look on his face when he sees Baam bursting walls in order to save him lol, especially with Karaka at his side. - I love how intimdating Karaka's eyes are, its so characteristic of him, he has a certain dangerous aura. - White is a character I went from ""Fuck Hoaquin"" to ""Wtf I love Hoaquin"", he's a real nutjob and glad he's on Baam's side. Miss Vicente though... - I wish more characters died, the cast is just WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too huge, I have to do like Rak and call them turtles. - Missing thunder kid Khun Ran and Anaak too, sad they don't appear more often, especially with Isu now doing amazing things. - I really liked how antagonists are presented and show how menacing they are, especially Kallavan, he's one of those foes that's out of anyone of the regulars league, not even Baam can fight him head on after all that training. Hoaquin, Kaiser, Hell Joe, Doom, for example. - I liked the introductions of Evankhell and Yama, at first I was like ""Fucking hell not more characters..."" but men Yama's transformation was INSANE! He looks majestic asf and Evankhell, I love how powerful she/he is and it seems those flames are related to the ancient power Rak has. - Secondary characters I enjoyed: Isu, Wagnan, Sachi, Boro, Isu, Vicente, Ehwa, Hatsu, Hockney, Jingsun Ha, Yuri. - My favorite characters are Mascheny, Endorsi, Hwaryun, Khun, Rak and Jue Viole Grace, the edgy emo version of Baam. The things I didn't enjoy were: - The cast is way too huge, we get some cool characters and BAM they dissapear... You can't get too attached because of it. - The power creep of Baam is something I don't like, I felt he should've kept the power level he used against Jahad much longer, instead he got powers ups after power ups after power ups... He left behind people like Ran, Rak, Endorsi, Anaak, Hatsu, Cassano, Horyang, Laure, etc. I hope the power ups ease up for a bit now, its getting a little silly now in Baam's case, would prefer he use his genious like intelligence in fights like he did with Kaiser. Glad I caught up with his amazing series and to be able to discuss crazy theories in this sub!"	TowerofGod

Incoming live feed falling apart	Hey guys! So we're hosting an event where our guests do streams on our channel. They are streaming directly into my vMix with SRT (via OBS 25), and we put the stream out to our channel. Last week we had 4 gameplay streams, and only one had problems I've never seen before. [https://youtu.be/Vw1Hl4o2TWg?t=1831](https://youtu.be/Vw1Hl4o2TWg?t=1831) Go to 30:30 in the video, for some reason I can't link with timestamp As you can see, the feed is falling apart. This was only a problem when there was no movement on the screen: when the guy is racing, we get a clear picture, but when he stops or goes to the menu, it gets worse. The weirdest thing is, he started shaking like a madman on his webcam, and for the most part, it fixed the issue. So movement somehow mitigates the problem, but I have no idea how or why. In this case, the streamer is using an Elgato HD60s to capture the gameplay from his Xbox, and streaming it to me with 6000kbps. The other 3 streams didn't have this problem (in 2 of them the game was played on the streamers PC, and in the last it was captured via NDI locally) So now I'm testing for tonight with another guy, completely different PC and network, but another racing game captured via Elgato. And he has THE SAME PROBLEM. They stream with their own setup directly to YouTube daily, never had this problem before. Any ideas what's causing it? Please help!	vmix

Why do you think that women have it easier than men while chads have it easier than Stacies?	The only thing that women can get easier than men is sex and nothing else. Sex is a pleasure that only last a few minutes. Stacies can only get commitment from chads if they‚Äôre lucky, heck I literally see normies cheating on their Stacy girlfriends. However a chad can get both love AND sex from women, he can literally get that from women better looking than them. A chad-lite with a great personality can get a giga-Stacy wife in a heartbeat while most giga-Stacies have to struggle to get commitment, emotional support and loyalty from their looksmatch. The emotional support they they get from men less attractive than them isn‚Äôt even that genuine cause it will be gone the moment where she loose her beauty wether it‚Äôs in an accident or by gaining weight. I am a woman, but If i reincarnated as a good looking dude then i will be extremely happier than if I woke up looking like Scarlett Johansson. A good looking tall man, just have to have a great personality, hobbies and passion, be able to pay his bills, and trust me he will have an army of Stacies and high-tier loyal beckies that will fight to get his commitment so that they will be his sweet lovable wife. A Stacy on the other hand don‚Äôt have have an army of chads and high tier normies that will fight to be chosen as her caring, sweet, protective husband. She will just be traded for another Stacy, because of how much men crave variety. Average looking men can also easily get commitment and love from women that are just 1-2 point above them and they know it, that‚Äôs why you have many videos teaching them how to get hot girls, but you don‚Äôt have YouTube videos that teaches women how to get hot men, it teaches them how to get a man to commit to them, and see them as something more than a living fleshlight	PurplePillDebate
Theoretical Quiet Title Situation - What is the outcome?	This is purely theoretical, but I'm curious as to what we think the outcome would be. Location: US (FL) * Person A buys several plots of land. * Person A goes to prison on serious federal charges. Person A has a family and needs to take care of their family. Person A also needs money for attorney fees. Person A also does not want assets siezed. * Person A gives their family member (Person B) verbal permission to sell properties on Person A's behalf while in prison. Person A may or may not be aware of this, but Person's A signature is forged onto deeds by Person B, transferring said pieces of land from Person A to Person B. Person B knows notary (Person D) that can facilitate this for Person B. * Person B facilitates homes to be built on the plots of land several years later via Person B's property company. * Person B (and Person B's property company) sells to Persons C (say 5-10 people) homes using aforementioned forged deeds as proof of ownership. * Persons C pay fair market value for homes, absolutely no knowledge of fraudulent activity. All Persons C have owner and lender title insurance. No issues come up in title search. * Person B uses profits from home sales to keep Person A's family afloat, and to pay for Person A's attorney fees while Person A in prison. Person A and Person A's family see all profit from property sales. * Person A gets out of prison several years later (like 10-15 years). Approx. 1 year after release, Person A tries selling one of the properties they wanted Person B to sell for them while they were in prison. Person B had never gotten around to it. Person A assumes the property is still in their possession, perhaps forgets about verbal agreement several years prior. Finds out Person B still owns said property due to forged signature of Person A, and has Person A has issues selling. * Person A now sues Person B's property company, along with all of Persons C via a quiet title action, stating that all properties belong to Person A because Person A was in prison at time of signature, and thus could not sign documents while in prison. Person A falsely claims that Persons C were all warned of the fraudulent activity, but Persons C (all of them) have no recollection or record of this. What happens to all Persons involved? Would Persons C be protected under boni fide purchaser? Who do the properties belong to?	legaladviceofftopic

[Q] How is pricing determined?	I've noticed that the price differences between sites like steam and 3rd party sites aren't always proportional. For example, the karambit tiger tooth FN is $630 on steam and $425 on 3rd party sites, meaning that the 3rd party site is 67% of the price. The talon knife tiger tooth FN is 71% cheaper on 3rd party sites. I have sent trade offers where I am overpaying if you calculate with 3rd party sites, but they think the offer is a lowball bc on steam I am underpaying. What platform should I primarily use when evaluating and sending trade offers?	GlobalOffensiveTrade

[Idea] I think you would all enjoy working...	**...if it wasn't so kafkaesque**. It took me a while of practical thought to get here, but I'm logically here with my train of thought. Instinctively humans love to feel resourceful, as it is a trait carried to us from our neanderthal forefathers. However given the state of affairs that exist today (between wealth inequity and the lack of communal presence related to one‚Äôs job), we have a big portion of the population (myself included) who are anti-work. However, we still have people that enjoy playing games like ‚ÄúThe SIMS‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnimal Crossing,‚Äù we have people that love slice of life shows, such as ‚Äú[The Devil is a Part Timer](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama),‚Äù a big portion of the population who are anti-work, also enjoy the idea of work from afar. But why? I recently watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhD2rmhcBFM) video discussing a theory about ‚ÄúAnimal Crossing‚Äù. In summary, the main character is dead and you are in purgatory. The theory is is partly evidenced through the ideas that life within Animal Crossing is very simple. Work is simple, bills are simple, owning a home is simple; and life within Animal Crossing is simple because it is viewed through the objective lens of a [deceased?] child. Kafka poses that through excessive bureaucratic burdens, people are left confused in paperwork. We don‚Äôt know what's going to happen next, nor where to turn [/u/blom95], and we are stuck in this jungle of complex ideas with little ideological substance. Gone are the simpler days of working communally: as the towns blacksmith, or the state‚Äôs [teacher](https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/). Instead, are the days of working as someone‚Äôs *senior insurance claims adjuster*, woo! The aforementioned ideas parallel and describe the anti-work situation today. Work no longer provides the working individual **meaning** in their pursuits (not true for all careers, but true for most). Work is no longer a simple lifestyle, but at best, complicated. The population of anti-work is not a lazy population, but rather those who desire a simpler life.

Really struggling	It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve posted on here. I was doing so so well. I honestly remember driving home from a few months ago thinking ‚Äúoh my god, I can‚Äôt believe the life I allowed myself to live, I can not imagine ever wanting to drink again!‚Äù Here I am. My (ex) SO and I had a few days where we drank together after this pandemic and his dad passing very suddenly (like dropped dead in his bathroom suddenly). He was an emotional wreck for a few days. And we were drinking heavily for a few days together. Then everything came to a head. We got very intoxicated and his mood flipped. He got very very violent with me. I was terrified. The next morning after waking up I told him it was over and I knew it was bad timing but this just could not happen again, we had to get away from each other. This is a four year relationship, we haven‚Äôt had sex in a year or so, so it‚Äôs not like it was great and I thought I was SO ready to be out. Here we are, living together and I‚Äôm dying. I feel like my heart is being ripped out of my chest and I‚Äôve been drinking (not currently). I‚Äôve been drinking with my neighbors, I‚Äôve been drinking alone, with friends who are also trying to quit but we just tell each other these are unprecedented times and we should give ourselves a pass. But here I am, I haven‚Äôt really stopped drinking since this pandemic started (save a few days here and there). I‚Äôm unemployed, lonely and depressed and feeling so worthless. My ex seems fine. He lives in the spare bedroom. He hasn‚Äôt drank since his violent outburst. And I just feel like a bandaid that needed ripped off.	stopdrinking

Homebound [Science Fantasy, Fan-Fiction, 3000 words]	"Hello! I'm looking for feedback for the first chapter of my (incomplete) science fantasy, a League of Legends fan fiction. **Summary** It follows a teenage inventor on a mission to reverse a tragedy, and an earth mage who's just recently returned to her homeland after a long exile and is now searching for her nomadic family and tribe. A mysterious power brings the inventor to Shurima, a desert continent, intertwinig his path with the mage amid the land's most tumultuous time. Here, a newly re-risen empire rules again, threatened by internal strife, foreign intervention, and restless ancient powers. The inventor and mage must find their way home, all the while uncovering dark secrets about the land, the people around them, and themselves. (This is not fluff by any means, and does not intensely focus on romance. It also shouldn't require lore or game knowledge to understand). **Chapter Info** The chapter I have linked follows the inventor's POV. It's written in first person and is about 3000 words (3200 if you count the little note in the end). The next chapter follows the mage's POV, which again alternates back to the inventor's in the chapter after that, and so on. I'm concerned about: * The opening scene. I've had this piece critiqued before and some of them have mentioned that it was a bit too difficult to read. * The hook. My hook exists as a memory, and someone commented that I should've made the hook ""in the scene."" It gave them enough reason to stop reading past the first line break. * The narrative style. This is my first attempt at a first person story, so I spent a lot of time trying to get the inventor's narrative voice right (and am in the process of tweaking the mage's). Some have commented that the narration has a bit too many declarative sentences and could use some sentence variation here and there. * Clarity. One reader suggested that the chapter gets a bit confusing later on, but that they did understand what my MC was trying to achieve. Because of this, I fear there may be parts that don't logically flow well. * Other stuff that I may not have caught. This chapter will serve as the framework for how I'll write the other chapter's of the inventor, so I'm hoping to clean it up as much as I can and find strengths I can replicate, and weaknesses I should avoid. At the very least, I want to know if it's interesting or not, and if it's worth turning to the next chapter. I've had this work critiqued many times, which have lead to massive improvements since its first version and lessons about writing in first person. I'm fairly certain I don't have to completely change the chapter, and that there's still some stuff I need to iron out. That's all. Honesty will be much appreciated, and I'm open to any questions about the chapter. Thank you very much in advance [Homebound Chapter 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16dFpyOZoII_KqmWvqWC2ai0aEkdmuYdf2Po3IgGhDf8/edit?usp=sharing)"	fantasy_workshop

36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar. If you're on the same page, hit me up."	chat

Finishing rough end of rubber(?) floor	Hello, English is not my first language so I hope I can describe our situation clearly. In february, I started working at a new bar here in the Netherlands. Since the Corona crisis, we are closed after being open for just 6 weeks. So now we try to fix little things at our place. And of course our budget is very tight right now. The floor here is made of some sort of hard rubber tiles. And the walls are very rough. There is this ugly space between the floor and the wall we'd like to finish. See here: [floor edge](https://imgur.com/gallery/JPNPfOI) I was thinking of placing a plinth on the floor and filling the gap with some sort of epoxy of concrete. Would this work? And what would be a low budget material to work with, while being strong enough to be cleaned every day? I hope you could steer us on the right track!	DIY

It feels harder because I can't be mad at her	It's day 3. Still feels like day 1. We had the healthiest relationship. Never fought, and anytime we had issues we always discussed them maturely like adults. We were always on the same team against the problem, desperately searching together for a solution that would foster a continued long term healthy relationship. Our friends always looked at us as the quintessential healthy happy couple. We were the example they looked to for what they should want in a relationship. I think in everyone's eyes we were already married and the whole proposal, ring, I do thing was just a formality to be taken care of at a later date. We were happy. And then her feelings just started to fade. Over the course of a month she started having constant anxiety attacks over her guilt and fear about how her feelings were changing. I thought it was just the stress of a hard semester and quarantine, but I guess it wasn't. She was miserable when she told me because she knew how much it would hurt me and she didn't want that because she still loves me and cares for me so much, just not like that anymore. There's no other guy, but sometimes I kind of wish there was because then I could just be angry at her and move on, but I can't. She brought me so much happiness and she didn't do anything wrong, and it just makes it so much harder because it feels like this didn't have to happen. This is really hard.	BreakUps

Bethesda, please make the ghouls at Radiation Rumble drop High Radiation Fluids!	Radiation Rumble is quite possibly a very big missed opportunity. Players can‚Äôt find enough high rad fluids and the rate at which they spawn is bizarre. Radiation Rumble should have at least 1 out of every 5 ghouls or enemy spawns drop fluid. At the event at least 10-15 ghouls flood into the room all at once and (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) more just keep coming as you accumulate more radioactive ore so that means at the start of the event you can get at least 3 and more fluids and way more of you do well. This should have been one of the best ways to farm HRF since that stuff is so rare and valuable. Most nuke zones don‚Äôt spawn tons of mobs anyway outside of the Whitesprings. Please make this event more valuable by having the enemies AT LEAST have a chance of dropping HRF.	fo76

Halfords said their rear dashcam doubles up as a reversing camera. It does not. What can I do?	I am fucking livid. I went to Halfords and asked them to install a stereo, and asked for them to install a rear dashcam that can be used as a reversing camera too.

All in all I paid like ¬£600, went to reverse and the camera didn't come on the screen. Went back to Halfords a few days later and they told me it's not a reversing camera. I am fucking livid because I've already paid for it all. Is there anything I can do? They just said it's my problem and I can buy another reversing camera and pay for installation again.	AskUK
What do I do about my (18F) uncle (43M)?	About a year ago my uncle moved in with my family, he claims his reason for moving in was because he had just sold his house and wanted to wait for the market to crash before buying a new one. My mom accepted this because she and my uncle had been through a lot growing up and she wanted to help him out. Once he moved in it was never really an issue because he worked odd hours, often only being home from 2am to 11am. Once the quarantine hit he had to keep going to work because he was in an essential service field, but he was really mentally shook by COVID and after talking to a doctor about anxiety he somehow managed to get about 6 months off of work, he hasn‚Äôt gone since the end of February and he won‚Äôt be going back until the end of July. Ever since we had the switch of him not going to work anymore and being home all the time the dynamics in the house changed drastically. Usually if my uncle had anything to say in the past it was probably going to be something negative about my older brother, but in January my older brother moved out, and the focus switched on me. It grew slowly, often being comments about me getting high (I have a medical card, and I choose to smoke weed for my ADHD and my anxiety) and he would often say that I‚Äôm not worried enough about everyone‚Äôs lives with COVID 19 and that I was putting them all in jeopardy, despite the fact that it wasn‚Äôt my fault that my school closed later than most and I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere else. Now it has gotten much worse, at this point he won‚Äôt even say hello to me in the mornings when I first wake up, the only thing out of his mouth is a complaint about something I did or even blaming me for things I didn‚Äôt do, like one cup left in the sink, or a single water bottle on the table. I‚Äôve taken to having to walk on eggshells around him in my own house, trying not to do anything to set the bomb off. My parents see this and agree with me about how annoying it is, and my dad had to sit him down and have a talk with him about his treatment of me. That was about two weeks ago and it certainly got better for a time, we were actually able to speak again without him calling me names and I even came to his defense once or twice when my mom started talking about how awful he is. This all came to a head yesterday, in one of the biggest blowout fights my family has had in awhile. It was Mother‚Äôs Day and both of my older brothers came to visit (no other family) and we were all having a really nice day. Later in the night my brother and I were hanging out in the garage talking and my uncle walks in and immediately hones in on me, saying that someone peed on his floor like an animal and asking if I knew anything about that, he also somehow managed to call me a retard during this (I‚Äôm a girl what the fuck how would I pee on his floor). My brother hears this and just immediately goes into what the fuck mode, and my brothers pretty famous for having a slightly bad anger problem, he immediately starts berating my uncle for talking to me like that. My uncle then immediately takes it to the next level, bringing up past fights and raising the volume til they‚Äôre yelling at each other, then I see my brother start to stand and I immediately realize that he‚Äôs about to make things physical so I start screaming for help and my oldest brother comes sprinting in, pushing them away from each other and my dad brings my uncle inside. Later they come back out and everyone apologizes to each other and I thought things were going to be okay again, until after my older brothers left. I was still in the garage and there were a few wrappers on the table, I was standing to start cleaning up and my uncle walks out and starts to call me homeless for the mess that my brothers had made, as I was in the process of picking it up, he starts to say how clean he keeps the garage and how I just come out there and don‚Äôt give a fuck. I just start to ignore him, because it was obvious he was seeking a reaction. I‚Äôm still picking up and he‚Äôs just standing there insulting me in different ways trying to get me riled up, he even attacked my boyfriend at one point for ‚Äúnot having a home‚Äù (his parents might be kicking him out, it‚Äôs a really bad environment and I‚Äôve been trying to help him find a place) At one point I just looked up and he was grinning ear to ear, and I just called him an asshole and left. Now it‚Äôs the morning and I don‚Äôt know what to do, after the way he treated me last night I don‚Äôt even want to see him again but he lives with me so there‚Äôs no way I can get around it. My parents know about this but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to kick him out. I don‚Äôt know what to do from here, any advice?	relationship_advice

Contracts are so broken in MyClub it amazes me that they made it past QA	To understand why contracts are so freaking bad in MyClub, you have to understand why they're there in the first place. Contracts, like stamina and team building, are micromanaging gameplay elements designed to keep you with things to do between games. The reason they work in FUT is because the player base has control of the market, they are also given out a lot more generously in packs. This combines to make contracts an element of the game you have to take into consideration while it not really being a major part of the game. In FUT it's possible to give your players contacts for 500 coins or if you were to make 2k for a game roughly 25% of game earnings. This means theoretically if you were to play a game of FUT you could renew 4 players with one game. Doing basic math, if you were to play 10 games of FUT, it would only take 2.5 games roughly to pay for your entire starting 11's contracts. Giving you 7.5 games of profit. This keeps the momentum of the game up and it means you never feel like you can't use certain players or team's because of contracts. **Good game design.** Now for PES, if you have a black ball player you could pay up to 3.5k for a 10 game renewal, you receive between 1-3k for a game depending on you winning or losing plus other elements. Can you see the problem? Let's use the same math as last time with 10 game sample. If I was to play 10 games of PES and in that time 11 starters run out of contract I could pay 30-35k to renew their contracts. Now, if I was to win every single game comfortably, I would be lucky to make a profit, all reality I'm more likely to break even. If I lose a single game then most likely I'm making a loss, if I was to go 7-3 over 10 ranked games, I should come out with a profit right? What makes it even worse, is that, if I was to create a team of crappy, white, bronze and silver players, play them against crappy CPU until their contracts run out then discard them I end up making a 20-30k profit. I played a game against the legend CPU today, just 1 game, I lost, received 1000 GP before being met with 18k of player renewals (6 players) and a 7k manager one. This has completely ruined any momentum I had, I feel like I've been punished for playing the game. The whole system goes against the point of a card collecting football game, your supposed to build your team and upgrade players, in this game I feel it's better to use the worse players. It gets worse, it also goes against their own design philosophy, you encouraged to rank players up, so the fact that it is much more viable source of GP to just play with players and thrown them away makes very little sense. **Bad game design.** The thing is this, it could be fixed so easily. **1st:** Just take them out the game, doesn't really change the core game at all but improves the experience drastically. **2nd:** Make it like 90% cheaper, getting an 18k bill to renew just over half of the team is too much. **3rd:** Every game you receive a contract plus a scout, this means you can stack them and it's not as costly when multiple players run out. I apologise for the rant, this has been annoying me for a while and the 18k just topped it for me, I actually have been really enjoying my time with MyClub as a whole, but the fact that nobody in the design or quality assurance part of the company saw this and flagged it is unbelievable to me.

I looked up a British Youtuber who was busted for sexually coercing/abusing/harassing multiple underage girls a few years ago...	"And he holds a job as a recruitment consultant now. It got me thinking about how men are able to bounce back from their ""indiscretions"", no matter how grave, without so much as a peep from anyone, despite the fact that this guy was on record for having coerced and harassed multiple girls (some as young as 14) into doing sexually inappropriate things when he was a grown man in his 20s. Searching his name alongside his old YouTube handle brings up multiple posts on Tumblr (for some reason, that was the preferred platform for expos√©s back in the day). And yet this guy has faced zero tangible, real world consequences for messing with the lives of these girls/children. He simply deleted his online presence and got himself a job *the same year he was outed*. It's incredible what they get away with."	GenderCritical

Special Ammo Economy needs a tune up, Special weapons don't need nerfs.	I have been seeing a lot of posts asking for nerfs to various special weapons like Bastion, MindBenders, Revoker, Erentils, Joutuun(for some reason) and ofcourse MountainTop. But IMO, special weapons aren't that broken now(Revoker is an exception), sure snipers could use a tune up in AimAssist and Flinch and mountainTop Sticky could be tuned too. But none of these things would stand out this much if Special Ammo wasn't so abundant in this game, hell in most Survival and 6v6 you can pretty much run nothing but you Special the entire round because of how much ammo you get and I have done similar things in Trials too, Special Ammo Economy needs to be toned down, I have a few ideas.. Tweaks to the existing system. *. Instead of 2 ammo, starting ammo should be turned to 1. *. Allied Guardian Deaths shouldn't drop Special Ammo, this way special starvation would be thing If the enemy don't run Specials. *. Max Scavenger pickup should be limited to 2 rounds, not more than that. *. Special Ammo shouldn't carry over to rounds....i don't understand this decision ? Why would you help snowballing in competitive modes ? *. Reviving allies should give them special Ammo.	DestinyTheGame

Why is there no interest on damage deposits?	I alway thought there would be interested added to damage deposits, since I believed they went into the landlord's bank account for holding until being returned to the tenant. I checked out this handy NS gov [calculator](https://novascotia.ca/sns/access/land/residential-tenancies/security-deposit-interest-calculator.asp#calculator) to find out that there is in fact 0% interest since 2013. Does the money go somewhere else, not to the landlord, when you pay it? I thought we email-transferred ours directly to our landlord a few years ago when we moved in. Looking for some clarification, and hoping to learn something new here :)	halifax

Second plot idea. This time about subverting expectations	No overdone revenge plot anymore. - it turns out elli isn't immun against the spore virus. - it just works much slower on her and she is becoming a new form of clicker - she will keep her mind and get the ability to control clickers - she becomes something like the borg queen - she knows instinctively that she needs to go to a specific place - she convinces joel and a few others from tommies settlement that she needs to do this - They go with her to help and protect her - on the way they get into conflict with the seraphites that see every clicker as evil and everyone that isn't them to just as evil because sooner or later everyone will become a clicker - when elli gets to her destination she gets rooted into the ground and becomes the cure for the spore virus - she dies in the process - she wasn't the cure we expected but she was still the cure	TheLastOfUs2

Jagex - can we get a serious response on the poor server performance and your plans on addressing it?	"Between COVID-19, Archaeology, DXP, Mobile/iOS beta, Mod Warden's promises (which are actually coming true) and VERY successful Ninja updates, we might be in a resurgence for RS3. The servers have been choking and I've personally noticed an increased amount of ""dead clicks"" and lack of character responsiveness due to this. Can we hear what the company plans to do to address the poor performance of the servers so they can handle a better load of players? This is not meant to be viewed as any kind of ""got-cha question"" or sarcasm. I'd like to see RS3 become as successful as our friends at OSRS. (I legitimately DO have friends over there)"	runescape

PhD in ML lost on what to do after defending with new disability.	I was planning on going to a FAANG research lab/postdoc, but a severe injury has left me unable to work at the level required for these positions (full research + paper writing + consistent paper reading). I'm shooting for a data science/applied ml job as those concepts are very easy for me to use and apply even in my current state. The issue is my entire CV/experience has been geared towards research with zero production or non-experimental work (my research did make it into FAANG systems by software engineers though). I would really appreciate any input on what type of jobs to look for and any other advice on how to make a transition from a PhD level career -> low end BS/MS positions. I've applied to a number of places these past couple of weeks and I've only had responses/interviews for research level positions which I've had to turn down after finding out.	cscareerquestions

I am not in love with you.	We just fill each other‚Äôs void. I will always accept you. We can only do this together right? I just wish you were happier of a person. I‚Äôm so fun, you‚Äôre so quiet. Opposites attract but I can‚Äôt even talk to you unless you‚Äôve had a drink. I wish we were in love. I wish we could be best friends. It makes me wonder if there‚Äôs someone out there who could take care of me and let me take care of them that I got along with but I know it‚Äôs not worth hurting you over. You‚Äôve already been so hurt. I hope you sleep well. I don‚Äôt hate you. I‚Äôm just not in love with you.	offmychest

If Lebron and Jordan traded careers (e.g., Lebron won 6 rings, 5 MVPs, DPOY, etc., would there even be a GOAT debate?	Everyone in sports media has a recency bias, and we want to believe that the person that we are witnessing is the greatest ever, and the the accomplishments are unparalleled and legendary - greater than previous eras. A lot of people claim Lebron is the GOAT over Jordan despite knowing both sides of accomplishments. But if MJ had Lebron's accomplishments (4x MVP, 3-6 in the Finals) and Lebron had Jordan's (5x MVP, 6-6, DPOY), we wouldn't hesitate a second to call Lebron the GOAT. Just an observation.	nba
To the man who broke my heart	You told me I was too attached to you. I guess I am, but isn‚Äôt it normal to be pretty attached to your husband? Am I supposed to just go about my days as if nothing is different after you leave like you did without even telling me? When you refuse to speak to me or even tell me what you‚Äôre wanting to do? It seems like you‚Äôre capable of just turning off your ‚Äúlove‚Äù for me whenever it‚Äôs convenient and you expect me to just stay on pause until you feel better or decide you‚Äôre ready to come back or whatever or whoever it is you‚Äôre trying to figure out this time. I can‚Äôt force you to care about me but it‚Äôs amazing how you really made me believe that you did care. How I convinced myself what you have showed me is love. It‚Äôs unreasonable for you to expect me not to be emotional or to stop being ‚Äútoo much‚Äù or crazy and whatever else you said to me about how I should be handling your abrupt abandonment of our family. I don‚Äôt want to be more like you with your indifference and your coldness. You‚Äôre off doing whatever you want with no responsibilities in a different place with different people. It‚Äôs so easy for you to forget. I‚Äôm here surrounded by reminders of the life you walked away from. Our family pictures are on the walls and your stuff is still here and I‚Äôve had to look at it every day wondering what the hell you are planning to do. So fuck you. I supported you financially for years and helped you through so much and this is how I‚Äôm treated in the end? I‚Äôm done. I packed all your clothes into boxes and I‚Äôm taking the pictures down today. Apparently you wanted me to detach so now I am. Each day that passes I care a little less and one day soon I won‚Äôt even think of you at all. You‚Äôre always so arrogant about your ability to make me fall back in love with you whenever you want. I know in the past I‚Äôve shown you how easily I fall for your words and I give in to the smallest advances letting you back into my life. This time you‚Äôve finally pushed me away too hard. You‚Äôve been a pretty awful husband when I actually recount all the BS you‚Äôve put me through. But I forgive you and I appreciate the lessons learned from this latest dumping. I will never look to your words again. Your words are vacuous and meaningless. ‚ÄúThe immediate influence of behavior is always more effective than that of words.‚Äù Viktor E. Frankl	UnsentLetters
Why is this a thing?	I bought a ps4 slim earlier this year because all my friends sold their ps3 and it was boring when playing alone... But, after some time when i decided to buy some games, i noticed that i was technically scammed. I need the ps+ thing to play online in the non-free games . Anybody else thinks that this is kinda a scam? I need to pay for a game and then pay for a stupid licence to be able to play the game online? On ps3 when i bought an online-based game i was able to play it right away without the ps+ licence. Why?	PS4

ELI5: How does cosmic inflation increase distances and not just the size of objects?	I don't understand why cosmic inflation results in increasing distances between celestial bodies. If it's a phenomenon that affects all space, because *space itself* is being blown up, shouldn't it also mean that for example the distance between the atoms that make up our bodies, and our telescopes, and the entire earth, would increase too? And if everything gets inflated equally, why would we even notice a difference? Like, if I zoom in on a picture, the *relative* distances between objects doesn't change because everything is magnified equally. But cosmic inflation is explained as *just* the distances increasing while the objects themselves remain unaffected, apparently? Like, where is the limit drawn? Does the distance between earth and moon increase? Earth and sun? Our solar system to others?	explainlikeimfive

I drank again	After being sober for about 8 months I drank again and I didn't like it. There was no desire to keep drinking, I forced myself to keep going to find the joy I used to feel, but I just didn't have it in me to keep drinking. I woke up the next morning feeling like shit and hated that even more. I haven't told my sponsor or any of my friends nor do I intend to and I have no desire to drink again. I also feel like title of alolcohic that I have been using is false now.	stopdrinking

(Repost, looking for a bit more advice) A bit traumatised from an nitrous induced loop on acid, advice or comments?	Had a bad experience with lsd and nitrous and now I‚Äôm finding it hard to stop thinking about it pls help But of a lengthy one sorry, but please help me :( I‚Äôve posted about this before but didn‚Äôt really get the answers I felt I needed and also it was on bicycle day so got a bit lost, so thought I should try again. I did about sorta 120ug my first time doing acid. It was pretty intense for me and I was going a bit insane all night while at this small party. My boyf did a nang (nitrous oxide, whippets and whatever for people who aren‚Äôt Aussie) but yeah he suggested I try it after he had a really good experience where he saw colours but the other he saw demons. I‚Äôll explain the experience but even writing about it is hard and makes me scared. I did the nang and everything was okay in the beginning, but after I stopped breathing into the balloon I was sent into an insanely intense thought loop or just infinite loop in itself. Because the loop I was experiencing was over the realisation that the loop itself is realisation that the loop itself is realisation, it just kept going. As you can see even the sentence is like a loop. The best way I can describe the feeling is with two mirrors facing each other, reflecting each other forever. I know that might be hard to understand but basically I was realising that the loop was me realising... that the loop was me realising that the loop was me realising. Can u see how it can get repetitive???? It was so intense that I couldn‚Äôt see, I forgot I existed, I thought that I was the universe and I was everything. I was terrified because I felt like all there was in the universe was this loop forever and I had to just be this never ending loop. I heard a sound that was like my voice but it didn‚Äôt speak words, and it repeated and looped. I could see myself screaming with my hands on my head, but it was twisted and infinite and my eye was this white star with many points and it sort of twisted into the centre of my vision. My vision just continually twisted and would keep going. Eventually the twisting loops got shorter and shorter and my inside consciousness that was able to be somewhat there during the experience could sense it was building up to something. I felt like the Big Bang was coming and I needed to break free. As it tightened to break free I screamed. I began to come back and I was holding my boyfriends face and he was staring at me terrified. Everyone was so confused and worried because my scream was just unholy. I was sent into something similar to bloody insanity for the rest of the night. Tripped for 15 hours. Kept repeating the understanding of the understanding and realisation of the realisation. Everything is everything and that‚Äôs the loop. Later learned that after I did the nang I also stood up and screamed solidly for about 5 seconds. Then fell to the floor on my knees and screamed again. I also was able to figure out that maybe the screaming face I saw imprinted in my brain because of me screaming during this. I can remember this because of one night where I did mdma. I decided to do some nangs too. When I did the nang, after I came out I realised the same thing happened, obviously less intense. I thought maybe I should do another one, as this is my opportunity to understand the loop. I did a total of 3 nangs, and each time I came out of it with a new piece of information that I could speak and unpack and figure out. Coming out of those nangs was scary. My boyfriend filmed one and the look of fear on my face is unsettling. When I come out I don‚Äôt know where I am, sometimes even who I am. I don‚Äôt know how long it had been. I have to try remember how I got to where I was and what o was doing before. I make assumptions as I come out to try and understand where I am. The intense one I did when I came out, I thought I was my friend (who has some mental health issues) and I had just had a psychotic breakdown. One other time after on md, I thought my boyfriend was telling me I had to come back and we were gonna get in trouble and something happened as when I was coming out I heard ‚Äúare you getting it?‚Äù And didn‚Äôt know what came before. The last time I did it he could see I was scared so he held me and cradled me and said things like please (my name) I love you it‚Äôs okay, and I thought that he was my mum holding me and I just had done something fucked up with drugs at a party and my mum was crying holding me begging me to come back to her while I was curled up on a couch screaming and crying. I wasn‚Äôt. I was lying down on grass in the middle of a field at night. Coming out of those experiences are fucking terrifying. Words like scarred trigger me a little, and when people say oh my god or repeat words escalating in pitch. It just takes me back and scares me. I have a video of when I first did the nang. It‚Äôs so unsettling as you can see where u lose myself. The image I see when on the nang of me screaming in that loop is forever stuck in my brain and I get so unsettled every time I think about it. Also I get the exact same visuals, sounds and thought every time I did those nangs, just to be clear. Or at least I think they were all the same? I don‚Äôt know if I can ever do nangs again. I‚Äôm so much more just scared and on edge. My boyfriend scared me in the car as a joke and I had a scream crying panic attack. I never do that. I‚Äôm scared to sleep. I don‚Äôt know how to stop being so scared all the time. Can anyone please help me unpack this and learn something from it maybe? I just want to stop being so scared of everything and so anxious. I‚Äôm mostly scared when in the dark and by myself though. I still get it around other people. If anyone has had similar experiences, how did you get over it? What did you learn??? Or someone just tell me what they think is happening to me or advice? I‚Äôm getting a bit desperate and trying to overcome the fear I get.	LSD
I dreamt about child pornography and I am absolutely disgusted with myself.	"I play fucking ROBLOX quite often, and in my dream I was doing just that. I saw a new game that seemed interesting, so I played it. The opening screen was this mother forcing her daughter to do unspeakable things to her. I'm not exactly sure if I could've closed out of it or not, but in my dream, this seemed completely normal. I watched and suddenly, a new screen popped up and it was the same mother but the girl was older, maybe in her teens. This time, she actually seemed to enjoy doing these things to her mother. I felt really weirded out watching this, and suddenly, the actual game starts and theres people around me that I know. I ask them like, ""did you guys see the pornography in the beginning?"" and they just laughed and smiled it off, joking about it. But me, I felt guilty and disgusted with myself, and the feeling followed me to real-life. I guess I should tell you guys, but I've seen child porn before. Obviously, not fucking looking for it. But it came to a surprise to me and it was hard to register that kind of stuff. It traumatized me and it really sucks having a dream about this kind of stuff. Anyways, can anyone just tell me what does this mean? tl;dr: dreamt about incest and child porn and i feel very disgusted w myself plz help me"	Dreams
[Spoilers]Is 90 Day Fianc√® like No Sleep? Are we just supposed to pretend it's real?	I like this show, but I just don't know how to approach it. So, we go through this whole thing with David and Lana. We're supposed to believe Lana isn't real: she doesn't talk to him off the pay to chat site, they never speak on the phone (I think?), she never shows up, her picture is on a million websites, etc. Much like with Cesar. And then **WHOOP* there she is!! Did TLC find her and hire her? It makes no sense. But it makes sense if you think about this as a fiction. Was it all made up? Cesar has an acting career and his catfish showed up at the tell all, lots of shock and awe when she showed up at the tell all. What a plot twist! Then the same woman shows up with 90 Day's resident villian, Jesse. And by now it's obvious Jesse is purposefully a bad guy, or a foil, or a heal, whatever. He knows we all (?) hate him, or love to hate him if you're me. But now we have Tom. Two bad guys? Or will Jesse have a character arch and see what happened with Tom and Darcy and come to Darcy's aid? And then Tom will become our new heal. I'm calling it, Williams in some form is going to show up. Maybe the show will dig up the model to tell whatshername that she's being catfished. Is any of it real? Are we just supposed to pretend it's real? What do you do? Am I being pandantic?	90DayFiance
How to remove Ghosting?	Good morning! I have a Rocketbook Everlast (core? whatever) that I absolutely adore, but I'm noticing that it's starting to leave some ghosting behind when I erase. It's about 5 months old and I use it pretty regularly during the work week - I don't often leave notes on the pages for longer than a weeks time, I can say for certain it's never been longer than 2 weeks, so I wouldn't think I should have ghosting issues. It's super faint and not enough to interfere, but enough to annoy me. Does anyone know how to help remove the ghosting? When I clean, I use warm water, microfiber cloth, and clean in circular motions. I also clean the microfiber cloth 1x/week typically (more if I'm erasing a ton of text).	rocketbook
Did teams come to a gentleman's agreement not to stagger babies?	I have no empirical evidence for this, it's just that lately in OWL games, when baby D.Vas are the only ones left alive, instead of stalling them and delaying their deaths as per usual, teams would just finish her off quickly. Just wondering if they reached an agreement not to stagger, or teams just don't find it worthwhile to do so anymore.	Competitiveoverwatch

Why dont AFP and SPA work together or if Olson wins, why doesnt he work with the three	So, an odd thing ive always thought about is why wouldnt AFP and SPA work together on some things, or why wouldnt Olson work with both. Let me explain, so lets say we got Huey boi as President and AFP writes a share our wealth bill which would cap incomes and redistribute wealth, why would SPA vote against it?. Vice versa if Reed boi and SPA propose a bill creating a housing program which gives poor people housing. Why would AFP vote against it, when thats literally a plank in Huey Longs program. Now Olson, an ex wobbly radical progressive, why cant he compromise with both, he probably agrees a lot with Long and a lot with Reed. All three hate Wallstreet. I dont get why the three cant work together.	Kaiserreich

I have the feeling BotW won't age well at all.	A new direction for the series, a beloved game of its time and innovative ideas but its sequel will be able to fix all the rough edges, build upon its foundation, has got more opportunity to focus on its content and flesh out the game-mechanics. The situation reminds me of GTA3. Such a beloved game in its time with a respectable metacritic score of 97. But when Vice City and especially San Andreas released and build upon its foundation there is no reason besides nostalgia to revisit this game. Nearly everything was done better now. Even the fans of this game realized it. Noone is talking about it anymore. I'm so hyped for BotW2. Because I see the *potential* in BotW.	truezelda

My work just got a lot of Matilda Jane in...	So I work at a consignment shop and we get a lot of MLM clothing in (Lularoe, Agnes & Dora, Matilda Jane). Recently, we had this lady who was a trunk keeper for Matilda Jane come and drop off at least two car-fulls of that junk, tags still on it & everything. My boss has mentioned that after we go through it we should live stream all of the pieces we got in. I‚Äôm pretty sure she got this idea from the lady who dropped it all off. On one hand I understand that she would want to do that in order to try to make money & to let people know we have, but on the other hand I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll ask me to do it since I‚Äôm in charge of all our social media pages. Does anyone have any advice on how I should talk to her about this in case she does ask me to do it? We have posted some MJ stuff on our page in the past, but I feel like live streaming all the pieces we have is different.	antiMLM

Putting grip	So I have played now for about 7 years and I feel quite comfortable with my backhand and forehand techniques. I can most often hit the lines I'm looking for and feel quite confident on the teepad. I throw around 400ft RHBH and 320ft FH. My score is still dragging because of a thing that has bugged me almost the whole time. I miss right of the basket while putting. I have re-checked many of the good putting clinics out there in youtube (feldberg, wysocki, Discraft). Sometimes I feel like I have figured out something big and start making the putts, but over time I return to my bad habits and start making the same mistake. Some days I really make the putts and feel confident, but usually I lose somewhere around 5 strokes a round because of misputts. I have tried to narrow down the reason of my misputts. My technique is kind of a mixture of push and spin putts. If I would think of a reference player, maybe Koling.. Some resemblance to McBeth's putting style. I draw my arm in a straight line down to my right knee and then use my left leg to generate power to my putt. Then comes the mysterious problem. I might just randomly miss right for now reason that I would be aware of. I have come to a conclution that I have probably a problem with the timing of the release and I also noticed that my grip is kind of funny. I have most of the pressure between my thumb and index fingers as they are squeezing the rim of my disc, and the other fingers are in a fan position. Do you have some advice on how to grip the putter in a different manner. Where do you have most of the pressure and what do you think about your release timing. What fingers are doing the work, or is it more about opening your wrist? Thank you!	discgolf
Political parties should be disbanded in the US. They literally only serve to divide the people.	First off, I understand that politics are not to be discussed on this subreddit. However, I dont see how this is an issue that regularly is discussed here or even anywhere. This seems to be more of a way of life in the US. So I'll post this and see if it actually makes it through. Im (M 22) only going off of what Ive seen growing up in the US. I have no background in politics or history. I do have a general knowledge of both, but not enough to say I'm an expert in either. With that being said, political parties should be removed in the US. I have seen time and time again where people will take a stance on something only because they pertain to a certain party. There is a herd mentality when it comes to this. Individual opinions are drowned out by the masses in each group. I wholeheartedly believe that most people have ideals that sympathize with more than their own party. I know you can choose to be an independent, and vote for whomever you choose. But thats easier said than done when the government is controlled by only two parties. And how often do you see an Independent candidate make it to the primaries? Rarely, if ever. There is too many individuals that get caught up in the ideologies of where they grew up or who they asscociated with as they created their own ideals. I realize this is easier said than done when thats all you know growing up, but parties dont make it any easier. US citizens need to learn how to genuinely voice their own opinions and not piggy back off of whats seems to be generally accepted by the whole. Stop being sheeple! Its aggravating as hell to see good causes shoved into the dirt because stubborn people want to support their own ideals and only can do so by picking a side. George Washington was worried about political parties hurting a government empowered by the consent of the governed. And now I understand why... There is a divide between us Americans that cannot so easily be mended. United we stand, and divided we fall. And boy we sure have fell. Edit: I dont think Ive thought about this long enough. I still dont think parties work, but ive found a few flaws in my argument. This is obviously ideal and lacks some reality, but the system we have now with two parties controlling the government is not working. Feel free to post how you feel about this.	unpopularopinion

Can Symkevi cause anxiety/depression? (M20)	I started taking Symkevi a few weeks ago, I‚Äôm on 1 twice a week and I feel it‚Äôs made my anxiety, depression, and overall motivation worse. I‚Äôve had mental issues like these for years and got therapy which helped a bit but they feel amplified since I‚Äôve been on Symkevi but it could just be a coincidence, I don‚Äôt know. Also unrelated slightly but I used to have a pretty high libido and now I hardly ever feel like doing anything sexual, I even struggle to get erections and if I do I lose them pretty fast. I was going to make an appointment with the doctors but they are only phone appointments because of Coronavirus. I have a clinic appointment in a couple of weeks with my CF team but I feel to embarrassed to bring it up with them as I see them regularly, I‚Äôd rather see a doctor about it who I won‚Äôt know for the rest of my life.

The Evil of Intellectual Monopoly	"""Economists and decent citizens alike are suspicious of monopoly. There are many good reasons for this. The traditional economic analysis of monopoly emphasizes the ‚Äúwelfare triangle‚Äù‚Äì the loss of efficiency due to the fact that monopolies create artificial scarcity in order to garner a higher price. More recent economic analysis emphasizes ‚Äúx-inefficiency‚Äù ‚Äì that monopolies use inefficient and excessively costly methods of production. .. *There is yet another reason to be wary of monopolies* ‚Äì *in order to transfer wealth away from the rest of society and toward themselves they must prevent entry.* The easiest way to achieve this is to stifle innovation. This blocks productivity growth thereby reducing overall prosperity. It is a different and arguably more pernicious source of social inefficiency.""

We have to talk about Linus	Whenever I search ¬´ Linus ¬ª on this subreddit, I only find people who praise him as he is the best character in video game history. I can‚Äôt understand that. Indeed, I hate Linus at a level you can‚Äôt even imagine. He is a hermit, living in a tent by choice and always playing the victim for that. He allows himself to dig in trashs, to say he will not do it again, and to do it right after. Also, Mr Linus happens to be picky af about the gifts we offer to him. Indeed, while he lives next to a lake in the mountain, he doesn‚Äôt like fish, doesn‚Äôt like some of other food, and will even complain. Like mate, you‚Äôre struggling to find food, we give some to you, and you criticize us of giving you food? Wtf? Just say thanks and that‚Äôs it. But the worst part happens during night. Every nights, Linus is spying everyone and if someone is by misfortune outside of his bed by 2 AM, he fucking knocks them out, steals their money (like 5k because that‚Äôs ok) and some of their items (and yes, of course that can be a sword costing 25k). And after that, HE WANT US TO THANK HIM FOR SAVING US. How is this even possible. And all of that happen in the street, in the mountain, in the 120th level of the mine or next to your bed. HOW? I could write a book about how bad is Linus and how much I hate him. Unlike other video game villains, he doesn‚Äôt have any talent or abilities. He is just a thief and an agressor. To conclude : Fuck you Linus. Also, please tell me why you love Linus, so I can try to understand.	StardewValley

"flight operated by ""X"" airline: which company buy from?"	Hello! I'm looking to buy a ticket from MAD-DFW. It's direct, so that seems to give me some sense of security. I've been able to find the flight through several different airlines (American, Finnair, and Iberia), yet all make a note that they are being operated by American airlines. Prices are similar for all of the flights. So I'm wondering who I should buy from? If it does get cancelled, would it be more safe to have bought the ticket through the American? Also, what does this mean when one company is operating all of the flights? thank you!	Flights

Pure Madra path benefits	I was thinking about different paths and it got me thinking that so far we haven't see that many benefits of a pure madra path or any particular reason Eithan would choose one. Benefits: * Easy on the channels allowing a lot of madra to be put into techniques * Has a soothing effect on Lindons channels after blackflame * Powerful for nullifying striker techniques Drawbacks: * No ruler technique/weak to ruler techniques * Doesn't have the best enforcer techniques (although Eithan says this Lindons seems pretty good) * Doesn't have much in the way of attacks (Either shatter their core with a striker technique or disrupt them a bit, no inbetween) * No defensive capabilities apart from striker attacks From Uncrowned it seems that the Aurelius clan specialises in storm and lightning based paths matched with their extraordinary sight; Eithan who gives the impression of being a long lost scion from the Aurelius main line seems to be on a weaker path. Obviously most of Lindon's focus has been on blackflame but he would be a shadow of the sacred artist he is if he only had a pure path. While Eithan is a very powerful underlord that seems to be down to his iron body, large core and excellent command over bloodline powers rather than his path at all, arguably he would be a lot more successful with a different path. So it got me thinking that pure madra might be more of a 'late game build' while BlackFlames are a deadly threat at copper maybe Pure madra paths don't start seeing their benefits until Archlord+. The counterpoint being that none of the higher advancements seem too fussed about his path or future advancement. Could be because I'm blatantly wrong or maybe there hasn't been a pure madra sage/herald so people aren't aware.	Iteration110Cradle
Weekly Discussion Thread (May 11th, 2020)	"Welcome to [r/Liberal\_Conservatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal_Conservatives)! what's on your mind? \----------------------------------------------------- **INTRODUCTION:** Liberal conservatism incorporates the classical liberal view of minimal government intervention in the economy. However, liberal conservatism also holds that individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions. As a user once said: ""Liberal conservatism is liberal means to conservatism. I.E. more personal freedom in society and freedom of government creates the most social stability."" We welcome all who wish to learn and share our ideology of kindness! **WHY WE DO THIS?**: To harbor discussion, boost activity, and generate awareness on the topic of Liberal Conservatism, we have decided to create weekly discussion threads to accomplish these goals.

seeking out martyrdom is not holy at all	"I used to be non-denominational and then my mom got divorced and remarried a Catholic man and we all converted. I sit on the edge of Catholicism, agreeing with some of it, but struggling with other parts. One part I am sure of though, is that seeking out your death for God isn't right. I've read and heard so many stories of saints who actively wanted to die for God, as in, they seemed to seek it out, or literally tortured themselves during life in order to die for him. but if they were really following what God had taught, wouldn't they be able to do his commandments better alive? If God wants you to serve others and spread the word, dying will just end your life and the few people that your gruesome death would inspire don't really seem like the kind of people who wouldn't just do the same as you, and die too, since it kinda screams, ""hey follow God, and you too can die in the arena!"" Of course, following any religion can be dangerous, that's a different topic. What I'm saying is that if you want your own faith to grow and inspire others, isn't it better to show them through your life? A real martyr isn't someone who seeks death for their cause, but who would be willing to lay down their life if they had to."	unpopularopinion

Advice on Rebuilding Sense of Security	My husband and I have been married for 3.5 years and from the outset, chose the Venn diagram model for finances: personal accounts and then a shared one for mutual expenses. I was never a huge fan of the idea: I thought it was fine to have personal accounts but that the majority of funds should be combined. My husband felt differently. Fast to yesterday when there was a catalyst for me to bring up my discomfort with our financial arrangement. We both make good salaries‚Äîbut my husband makes more than 2.5x what I make and contributes only a little more to our shared fund, keeping most of it private. It finally came out that he has a fear that I will leave him and doesn‚Äôt want to be left with nothing. This was devastating to me‚Äîan indictment on our trust, in addition to casting a shadow of ‚Äúself-fulfilling prophecy‚Äù on our marriage. But most of all, it was confirmation that there is deep insecurity for both of us about our marriage. So my question is this: we both recognize this insecurity and want to repair it. Have you experienced this? What did you do to improve it?	Marriage

The Ishval war arc should also be an episode longer, the Dublin arc should have an episode in plus as well , the Envy vs Ling and Lan Fan + Hohenheim scene with the robers should have been added too.

TIFU by buying super tampons	For background, I Always buy the same brand of Kotex U light tampons. Never had any issues. All was always well. And for TMI details, my period was finishing off, so lighter than usual but not quite finished. So yesterday I go to pee and realize I‚Äôm out of tampons. So I rush over to the store and buy the same package that I always buy, or so I thought. I open up the package and all of the tampons are in green wrappers, rather than the usual pink, blue and purple. ‚ÄúOdd‚Äù I think, but don‚Äôt bother to read the package. So I stand up, go to insert the tampon, and it felt like it stabbed me. (I didn‚Äôt get it in) ‚ÄúOW!‚Äù I scream. My boyfriend runs over and asked what is wrong. I told him that my tampon hurt me, he said that was weird and to try it again. So I guide the tampon in gently, and everything is fine. Or so I thought. I sit down on the couch and I can FEEL the tampon inside of me. It HURTS and is very uncomfortable. (You typically DONT really notice the tampon inside you) So now I‚Äôm thinking, WTF. I go and look at the package of tampons. There plastered on the front is the word ‚ÄúSUPER‚Äù fuck. I super fucked up, I never use super, and ESPECIALLY not when my period is barely there. So I go into the bathroom to take it out because I‚Äôm so uncomfortable and.... I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs stuck and it hurts like an absolute bitch. I run out into the living room with my pants around my ankles and a look of horror on my face. My boyfriend asks what‚Äôs wrong and I tell him I have a bloody super tampon stuck in me that hurts to take out. (Pun intended) So there I am in the living room trying to gently remove this tampon. Each little pull of movement BURNS in my vagina. It hurts SO BAD. My boyfriend tries to help and keeps asking if I want him to ‚Äújust pull it out.‚Äù ‚ÄúNO‚Äù I scream. After entirely way too long, I finally remove it from myself. And now the inside of my vagina feels like it has carpet burn. Joy. TL;DR - bought super tampons and one got stuck inside of me and now my vagina hurts	tifu

AOOs through an ally	Simple and quick question: Can I attack enemies that provoke aoo if there's an ally between them and me, if I have enough reach to hit them? I ask this because in the manual, they say that you can't hit them if they have cover: Cover and Attacks of Opportunity You can‚Äôt execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you. However, creatures give SOFT cover to other creatures: Soft Cover Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Stealth check So I need to have [Phalanx Formation](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/phalanx-formation-combat/) to attack them with an aoo?

Seriously dont stick anything up your arse (Girls and Guys)	I recently got an object stuck up my arse due to me using it as a masturbation tool. I've recently been going through a phase. So dont stick anything up your arse, seriously unless it's an actual sex toy which you know is safe. I had to tell my parents and ended up in the Emergency Department during a global fucking pandemic and now my parents think I'm retarded which is lovely (sorry if that word offends you I'm just using it in my frustration so please forgive me) Thats my moral lesson for today. Girls don't stick anything up your vagina either that you don't have a good hold on. Guys and Girls nothing up the ass except a dick or toy. Peace. Edit 1: If any bisexual or gay teens read this can I ask you some questions? Im questioning at the moment thus the object stuck up my arse.	teenagers

[Guide] Neverland Casino Slots 2020 - Level 200 or 300	*This guide is based on the format used in multiple previous guides made by* [***u/Mikazah***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mikazah/) &#x200B; **Overview** The offer 'Neverland Casino Slots 2020' is based on an app for both Android and iOS that allows users to play slots with chips. The offer required me to reach level 300 in the app. The game is as stated in it's name, slots gameplay. This offer is quite easy to automate and you spend little time actually doing something in the app. &#x200B; Be aware there's two versions of this offer, one is to reach level 200 and one is to reach level 300. I did the 300 one and it took me roughly 72 hours, I believe it's possible to complete the level 200 one in less than 24 hours. &#x200B; Also be aware this guide is based on what I did to complete the offer, there might be other and better ways to optimize it further and I also can't guarantee this method will work for you as slots offers are somewhat random, based on what rewards you receive from cases, lucky wheels and other bonuses. And of course what you win from playing the slots will also factor in. &#x200B; **Details** |Offer name|Neverland Casino Slots 2020| |:-|:-| |Offerwalls|AdGem & AdGate Media| |OS|iOS & Android| |Countries that has the offer (that I'm aware of)|US, CA, UK, DE, SE, NO, AT, AU, ES, FR, IT, ZA, NL| |Amount|Depends on the site you use, offerwall, OS & country. **I got $15.75**| |Time Limit|12 Days on AdGem| |Time Spent|Hands on \~2 hours. \~72 Hours idle.| &#x200B; **How to play & Tips** Here's the exact recipe I suggest you follow based on my own experiences. Use an iPad/Tablet or a spare phone if possible, so you can leave it running constantly without interruption. &#x200B; The first thing to do when you jump into the game is to collect all the free chips you can, Facebook login and clicking links from their social media (didn't work for me, but I've heard others say it works for them). Also check if you've received any wCases (bottom bar) that you can open. After collecting all the free chips, start playing slots. Jump into one of the slots that offers auto-spin and don't require you to hit any button when you get free spins. Examples of these are 'Great Grizzly' and 'Temple of the Jaguar' when you get to a higher level. Also if you can, try to find out which slot has the lowest re-spin time as you want to make as many spins as possible within the least time. You're gonna want to start betting with the smallest amount possible, 10K. As you bet you will start gaining rewards, this can be anything from XP boost to wCases and chips. The start will require you to monitor your rewards for a bit. If you get wCases I suggest opening them straight away as you can hold a max of 3 at the same time. &#x200B; Once you reach level 50 you will receive a 24 hour double XP boost. This will be crucial to use moving forward as it will speed up the level process a lot. You shouldn't take very long to reach level 50 even with minimum bets. After you've received the XP boost you should check how many chips you've got and scale your bets accordingly. According to the games FAQ this will make you level up faster. &#x200B; >If you want to level up faster, there are a couple of things you can do: > >Spin more frequently, or try higher bets &#x200B; Personally I didn't see a big difference in the movement of the XP bar when doing higher or lower bets, but I'll trust their word for it. Here's how I would scale my bets, I did it in a way that I didn't have to monitor it very often, you can probably put the bets higher if you want to speed it up further, but that will require you to monitor it more often to make sure you don't lose it all. &#x200B; |0-2M Chips|10K Bets| |:-|:-| |2-5M Chips|20K Bets| |5-10M Chips|50K Bets| And you can scale it further the more chips you've got. &#x200B; Now you just let it idle for a while and check back every 10 levels maybe to see if you get any case drops & to scale up or down the bets. Also remember to check back in every hour to open the hourly case you've received. &#x200B; Once you reach level 100 you're gonna want to stay around as this will give you a medium case which can gift you plenty of chips, open it and go back to spinning. From level 101-199 the rewards are really lacking when it comes to cases and the XP bar will slow down, so you don't have to check in as often. You'll also want to check in when you reach level 200 as it gives you the best wCase for you to open. Personally I have never ran out of chips, the lowest I've been is 500k with minimum bets running, which is when I decided to try 'Journey' game mode. &#x200B; If you feel that you're about to run out of chips, go ahead and go to the 'Journey' section. This is a game mode that lets you play certain slots for a certain amount before you can move on to the next one and receive rewards between. I would jump into the slot and just spam the screen with my finger to speed up the spinning process, then I'd immediately go onto the next one when it was unlocked and collect the reward between them. Rinse and repeat, only did it for like 30\~ minutes as the rewards weren't very good unless you got lucky with a wCase. I've gotten a couple of wCases from the rewards, so if you're about to run out of chips this can be a way to get back on track. &#x200B; When you're about to sleep, just leave the app running on auto-spin with the lowest bet amount possible. When you wake up in the morning, go ahead and open the 3 cases you've received while you slept and keep spinning afterwards. &#x200B; This is all I did to personally finish the offer in 72\~ hours with a total hands-on time probably less than 2 hours. My 24 hour XP boost ran out when I had reached level 210, so I think I covered a pretty good distance. &#x200B; I'd also suggest leaving notifications on for the app, so you get notified about morning or evening bonuses you can claim. Also the 2nd day of playing you get to spin the lucky wheel twice a day, this will also be a nice bonus. The bonus wheel starts automatically when you enter the app if you're eligible for it. &#x200B; I also think it's possible to complete the offer by being completely idle after level 50 or 100. This will probably require you to do minimum bets or close to minimum and it will take a bit longer. &#x200B; **How to get more chips** * You get a free case every hour that can get you more chips. * Connect your Facebook to get 1M chips. (Might not be necessary) * Open cases you get from leveling up. * Enable notifications so you can get the free lucky wheel spins twice everyday. * Play the 'Journey' game mode and collect rewards. * Their social media has tons of links you can click to get more chips (Didn't work for me, they just take me to the developers home page, but worked for some people apparently), just scroll down a bit and you'll get to the posts. &#x200B; **Should you spend real money?** With the amount of free chips out there to grab, I don't think it's necessary to spend real money. &#x200B; **Can I speed it up further?** Yes, the more you bet, the more XP you get (According to their FAQ). I went the safe route and maximized the amount of XP I got from my chips without taking too much risk. If you increase the total bet you will get XP quicker, but you might also need more chips in-case you go on a losing streak and lose it all. Safest is what I recommend, but feel free to test collecting all kinds of rewards and starting of on a higher bet amount. It's also entirely possible that I missed out on certain features in the app or didn't find other ways to earn more chips. &#x200B; Any feedback or thoughts on the guide? Any additional things I should include?	beermoney

Succesful Nebido story	Currently in the last few days of my third 1.000mg testosterone undecenoate (Nebido) shot. The protocol that my doctor has prescribed me is a 1.000mg shot every 7 weeks. That is around 142 mg of testosterone every week. Before I have used Androgel with no succes. Just a slight increase in libido but no morning wood. Fatigue was still present. The reason i started TRT in the first place is because of low libido, no morning erections, social anxiety, concentration issues (i was diagnosed with ADHD when i was 8 years old). Currently testing wether i have Klinefelters syndrome or not. Nebido works truly amazing for me. You have to be patient with it because the first shot did little to nothing for me. But right when i took the second shot i experienced the benefits for around 2/3 weeks. Now I am on my third shot and I experienced the benefits for almost fully 6 weeks. I experienced these benefits from TRT: \- I lost some bodyfat, but that is also from being in a caloric deficit. \- All my fatigue problems are gone! I dont need a nap anymore around 4 pm. That changed my lifestyle a lot! \- Everyday morning wood. Every. Day. \- Very high libido. I get horny around 4-5 times a day. \- Harder erections. My girlfriend also told me that my penis appears bigger when erect. \- Some increase in beard growth. The hair on my cheeks is also thicker. I know people have bad experiences with Nebido. That is because the standard protocol of 12 weeks. The optimal protocol for most people is around 6-7-8 weeks, though i dont recommed the 6 weeks protocol. It builds up a lot of testosterone on the long run -> long term problems. Feel free to ask my any questions regarding my TRT experience! I live in The Netherlands by the way so Sustanon, Androgel & Nebido are my only options.	Testosterone
Upgrading my bike, had a few questions	Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôve had this Diamondback Axis SE for 4 years now and I‚Äôm weighing my options between buying a new bike and upgrading this one. Had a few questions to see if I want to do is feasible and makes economic sense. Currently have a Suntour front fork, 100mm of travel. Wanted to upgrade the front fork and increase the travel. How much extra travel could I get away with? 120? 130? 140? Want to change my gearing from a 3x8 to a 1x9. Would I need a new derailleur too? Or just a new cassette on the back and use one of the front gears as well. And with that, I imagine I‚Äôd need a new shifter for the 9 gears as well? Appreciate the help!	MTB

My old friends are all addicted to drugs, in jail, or dead. So I'm super alone most of the time. my new friends recently turned out to be fake and slandered me behind my back. That's my fault because I knew the kind of people they were and I just kept giving them chances and telling myself they'd turn around. Go figure they didn't. I'm just super lonely and sad and I'm frustrated that I let myself get manipulated. I hate that I'm alone and I hate how I'm struggling over my past. I honestly wish I could just disappear. I have no one to vent too right now and I'm just experiencing so many emotions. I'm tired of being like this. üò¢üò°	Vent

New addition to the quiver, need advice	Hey guys, I want to add a new pair to the quiver.Right now I have the Atomic Vantage 95 (192cm) as my do it all ski. When it gets really deep I usually rent some powder skis. For next season I wanted to buy a new pair to shred the groomers. Like a race/carver ski. My profile: \- weight: 95kg / 210pounds \- height: 197cm / 6ft4 \- I like to go fast and charge hard at times, just cruise around and enjoy the views at others. \- Been skiing for 30 years, last few years I average 15 skiing days/year I was thinking about buying the Rossignol React R8 Ti ([https://www.snowmagazine.com/ski-gear/955-skis/rossignol-react-r8-ti-2019-20](https://www.snowmagazine.com/ski-gear/955-skis/rossignol-react-r8-ti-2019-20)) the longest 182cm version I was wondering if this is a good choice, or if I am better off buying something that requires more power and concentration like world cup rebels or something along those lines. I am afraid these ski's might be too easy/boring? Or will they keep being fun to take out, and challenge me enough? Does anyone have any experience with these? Any other suggestions I can look at are also welcome.	skiing
New watcher	Okay I liked TWD till about season 5/6 when it just got repetitive snd boring imo so decided to watch this and I love Alycia Carey as an actress so gave this a go Im on episode 3 and im just confused lol. I love Nick, he‚Äôs my favoriteüò© hope he lasts for a while. But anyways im just confused why no one tells other people whats going on in the first couple episodes?? Like alicia still doesnt know seems bad since it could effect her safety.. and weird acting here and there and also travis annoys the hell out of me for some reason lmao But does the show get better?

Why don't we go to the future?	This game is 100.1% following another version of the same game (JP) , so why the GL doesn't go directly to the future(JP). What I like this way, is that we won't know what the future is hiding. Instead of currently seeing how JP is doing and we know where GL will fall. Most games gone with the thier original JP or KR.

Is it someone new? If so, here is the perfect way to experience the Bioshock experience! + answers regarding to some games	As someone who loves the Bioshock franchise, I really want to give a helping hand to those who are relatively new to the series, so they can experience the full potential of the Bioshock franchise. I STRONGLY, STRONGLY recommend to buy the Bioshock Collection (especially when it is on sale, it is the most worth grab ever during Steam sale), as it includes all 3 bioshock games, as well as their remastered versions (Infinite does not have a remaster). It also includes Bioshock 2's DLC, as well as Infinte's 3 DLC plus the Season pass (gives you extra gear at the start of the game). Well, what's the best way to experience Bioshock? Here is the order of games you should play (isn't my opinion, most of the community agrees with this too) in order to experience it fully: 1. Bioshock 1 2. Bioshock 2 3. DLC - Bioshock 2: Minerva's Den 4. Bioshock Infinte 5. DLC - Bioshock Infinite: Burial At Sea (Episode 1 + Episode 2) 6. Replay - Bioshock 1 (you'll know why after Burial At Sea) You can play Bioshock Infinte: Clash in the Clouds any time, as it is not a story, but an arena/wave based game. You may ask: Do I need to follow this order? Well you don't really have to. You can actually play all of these games separately, because none of these games especially Bioshock Infinte will require the knowledge of an its prequel to understand the plot (except Burial At Sea, you must play Bioshock 1 in order to understand Burial At Sea). But I will whole-heartedly recommend to follow this order. What about Bioshock 2? I heard a lot of people saying that game is bad and not worth playing! Nope, the people who say that can shove it up their ass. Ok seriously why is Bioshock 2 not as good as the others? And what is the controversy surrounding it? So Bioshock 1 and Bioshock Infinte both have the same writers Ken Levine, but Bioshock 2's writer is not Ken Levine, which leads to fans speculating it is not canon with the rest of the games. Bioshock Infinite also does not acknowledge Bioshock 2's existence, which lead to even more controversy. Is Bioshock scary? To some maybe, I heard some people saying how the splicers in the first Bioshock creep them out, but personally I wasn't scared of it. Which is the best Bioshock game? There is no answer to this. For example, if you ask what is the best MCU film, you can't give an answer to which one is the best. There might be a favourite one, but there won't be the best one. Instead, I will give you the pros and cons of each game. These are not opinions made by me, but rather what the general community thinks: Bioshock 1: Best villain, best enemy design Bioshock 2: Worst story, best gameplay, best level design Bioshock Infinite: Best story (also most confusing one, it is the Inception of gaming), worst gameplay, best sidekick ever in gaming history (Elizabeth), saddest ending Are there multiple endings? Bioshock 1 has 3 endings (two bad, one good), Bioshock 2 has 6 endings (2 bad, 2 neutral, 2 good), Bioshock Infinte only has one ending. IMPORTANT: In Bioshock 1 and 2, you will get an option to either harvest or rescue the Little Sisters. Please, please don't harvest them. Do yourself, me and the community a favour. You will get a very bad ending, and you probably don't want a bad ending. Thank you for reading this post, and I hope you find this post helpful. The Bioshock franchise is argubaly the best FPS shooter franchise ever made, so I really want people to experience it at its maximum potential.	Bioshock

Survival (Day 1 : Part 2)	Walking from edge of the forest a ‚ÄúDeer‚Äù like creature moved toward us. I say ‚ÄúDeer‚Äù like creature because it at first glance resembled said animal. At first glance. Once you really looked at it then you saw the difference from a Deer and this animal. The head was similar to that of a deer but, the massive spread of antlers were far too extensive to be that of a deer. How it moved through the thick forest with that spread, I did not know. Next difference was the front legs. Thin like a deer‚Äôs, but longer. It shouldn‚Äôt be just walking towards us. Any normal animal would have run the moment it saw us. Instead it was walking calmly in our direction. It was taller than a deer, but with the same elegant stride. It reached us and continued through giving us no mind. I noted as it got closer that there were more differences to this creature and a Deer. This animal had not one, but two pairs of hind legs. It made its way through us and moved on toward the far end of the clearing. Where it stopped at the edge of the wood, looked about then leaped high in the air and disappear into the woods. For a good ten to fifteen minutes we stood there looking after the animal, that had just walked through us. Too stunned to say anything. Then Someone breathe out, ‚ÄúDid you see the rack on that deer?‚Äù With that the spell was broken and everyone turned to me. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù was the thought everyone had. For about an hour after that, myself and several others made the trip to the river. We were not sure what else to do. I had decide to just start gather my flint like rocks so that I could make tools. RJ and some of the people continued to work on the shelter. What else could we do. I had made three trips, when Sergeant Samuel and her group appeared through the hole in the bushes we had made. In her hand dangled a rabbit like animal. She waved at me. I dropped the load I was carrying, and jogged over. ‚ÄúI just walked up to it. It didn‚Äôt even try to run away? I was able to just reach down and kill it. What the hell is going on? It should have been afraid of us, but nothing. I only saw a few animals. I also noted something too.‚Äù Samuels side as I approached. She stepped to one side and let her group through. Some of them had different berries and small animals. The berries looked like some kind of Blueberries, but the wrong color of blue. ‚ÄúAre the berries good to eat?‚Äù I asked. A woman with dreadlocks spoke up, ‚ÄúI saw the rabbit animals eating them, so they should be OK to eat.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that for sure. So be careful,‚Äù I warned. ‚ÄúWell, if I get sick that should tell us something,‚Äù she replied. I groaned inwardly, but indicated the camp. ‚ÄúFind a clear spot to put the food down,‚Äù I instructed, then turned to Srg. Samuel. ‚ÄúWhat did you note?‚Äù I asked. She watched as everyone filed past her then spoke. ‚ÄúThe animals are not afraid of us, but they are afraid of something.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat did you see, to make you think that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI saw one of the local birds on our way around. I saw it before it saw us. When it heard us approaching it started to go higher into the trees, but then it saw us it stopped and moved back down to get a better look at us. I swear it was the oddest thing I've ever seen. Well how the bird acted, then again I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt see a bird like that before too. Anyhow, the behavior of the animals is strange. I can't explain, but here is something that is scaring the wildlife. It could be regular predators, but I think it‚Äôs something more. There is something else out there, I‚Äôm certain of it.‚Äù I told her about the deer animal and I thought about what she had said. A little later Tim, Rebecca, and their group exited the forest near to where Srg. Samuels had entered. They were laden down with pear like fruit. Tim had a dead bird grasped in his hand. He explained that they had discovered the ‚ÄúPear‚Äù Tree not far from the north edge of the woods, there was a small grove of the trees. Also that there were quite a few birds living in them. I told Samuel and him about the river and the strange fish. Tim wanted to go see the river and Samuel decided to go to. I took them down our rough path and showed them the river. We arrived just as Mama Fisher and Sheila pulled a big fish from the water. They had a few fishes piled behind them. Mama Fisher called to us as we approached. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had it this easy catching fish before. If I knew this place existed I would have come sooner.‚Äù Tim and Samuel looked up and down the river, inspecting the bank ‚ÄúHave you explored very far either way?‚Äù Srg. Samuel asked. Sheila spoke up, ‚ÄúI started to, but came back to help Mama F.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need to. I don‚Äôt know what resources are around here but we are going to need to find what we can.‚Äù Srg. Samuel stated. Then added, ‚ÄúIt is getting a little late.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe should take back what you have here. We‚Äôve got a good amount of food, and we need to start fires so we can cook.‚Äù I interjected. Everyone agreed and we began to gather up the fish. I had gathered up a armful of fish when I looked across the river. I was able to duck just in time as one of the Six legged deers leaped from one side of the river to the other. It Rushed over me and crashed landed six or seven feet past me. It jumped to its feet and rushed off into the forest. We looked after it for a second then looked back across the river. A group of strange bipedal three foot tall, scaly animals spilled out of the trees on the other side. All I really saw were their big head‚Äôs full of pointed teeth. They rushed down to the water‚Äôs edge and slid to a stop, seeming unwilling to go into the water. They chirped and hooted at each other, and stared across the water at us. Very quietly Tim whispered, ‚Äúeveryone back away slowly. Don‚Äôt make any sudden moves.‚Äù We slowly began to back away, the short velociraptor looking creatures watched us their long tails moving back and forth. We made it to the edge of the woods and scooted over to the hole in the brush we created. The whole time the toothy critter watched us with unblinking eyes. Slowly we retreated down the path till we were out of site. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll,‚Äù I said softly, ‚ÄúI think we found what the other animals are afraid of.‚Äù Mama F breathed out, ‚ÄúDid you see the teeth on those kani‚Äôa?‚Äù Sergeant Samuel stared back the way we came and replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what those monsters are but I think we're going to need to make slight change to our survival plans.‚Äù We gather everyone together once we arrived back at camp and explained what we had seen. Everyone asked what we were going to do about this threat? The only thing I could think of was to build a wall round our camp and hope the predators couldn‚Äôt jump. Also I was starting to feel glad I had gather some of the flint like rocks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need to build defensive's, for now wooden wall‚Äôs to keep the predators out. If anyone knows how to flint knap come help me work on some flint tools. Everyone else needs to stay close to camp. Don‚Äôt wander off alone. If you need to go out into the woods go in groups. We still need more wood and stuff for fire.‚Äù I indicated the man I had put in charge of wood gathering. ‚ÄúHow much have we gathered?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWe should have enough gathered to last all night. But if we have to start using it for other stuff it won't last long.‚Äù I thought about that for a second. ‚ÄúOK, we need to start getting fires going. Everyone who know how to start a fire need to do so. I‚Äôll start on making flint tools. We need people to keep a lookout. Four or five people need to go back down to the river and keep an eye out there. If you think you see any of the creatures get back here ASAP. We‚Äôll try and be ready for them.‚Äù Everyone went to it. Myself, Edward, and three other people sat down with our stones and began to work on them. I got the flint like stone a little longer than my hand. With harder stone began to carefully chip at the flint stone. It was harder to do then with regular flint but I seemed to get the same result. I keep the chips that came off, I could use them for other stuff later. Chip by chip I began forming my ax head. It took at least a hour to do one ax, in which time Mama F and some others had gone back to the river. Not seeing our little friends she and other gathered up the dropped fish. They brought them back and I gave them some of the flint chips so that they could cut and clean out the fish. Our firewood gatherer, Stefen, had brought us some branches so that we could make handles for our axes. While I and the others began making more ax heads, Edward took the branches and stripped them of bark. Taking two stones, one with a point and one to use to hit the pointed one, he began to chisel out a slot that our ax heads could fit in. Doc Bitterbeer had, as he had said he would, taking the bushes we had cut and began making twine with them. When he had gotten eight of them made he gave them to Edward. Edward in turn took the finished ax heads and put one into the slot he had made in a branch and use the twine to secure the ax head to the branch. All that work for just one ax. Edward gave the ax to one of the people helping RJ. That person took the ax and began chopping at a small tree for better wood, to make better shelters. For the rest of the day we made tools. RJ and his group erected shelters. Mama F and six or seven people made trips to the river, guarded by Sergeant Samuel. Tim and Rebecca cleared the brush near to were the ‚ÄòPear‚Äô trees were. Giving Doc more fiber to work with. Tim and Rebecca gathered more of the fruit. A man named Alexander, had began making fire pits and starting fires. Wisely he had lined the fire pits with stones. Mama F had started preparing the fish for eating, once Alexander had the first fire going she took over and began cooking the fish on flat stones. By that time we were sure the berries were safe to eat , the woman with the dreadlocks, Diane, had not gotten sick so we were fairly sure they were good too. All told we had enough food to barely feed all of us. Sergeant Samuel had taking a rough head count, there was about four hundred and six people. Both jet planes must have been fully loaded to take all of us. RJ would not have enough shelters make by night fall so most of us would have to sleep on the ground. With the local insect not bothering us it might not be too bad. The biggest concern was the water. Could we safely drink it? Two of the people with Mama F group had drank some water, and so far they seemed fine. But it was too soon to be sure. I was becoming very parched, and so were others. We might have to risk it, soon. As the sun began to set, my hands were cramped, I had smashed my finger multiple times, my back ached from being hunched over, but in return we had between the five of us had made 10 axes, four spear heads, and three knives. Stefan had not found branches long enough for the spears, because RJ and use so many to make shelters. We would have to wait for the morning to get one of the axes and chop some branches or small trees to make the spear shafts. Mama F gave me a flat stone with a chunk of fish, two slices of the ‚ÄòPears‚Äô (which were fairly hard and tasted like a mix of pear and peaches), also I got a hand full of light blue blueberries ( the tasted like blueberries with a tangy after flavor), and a little of the ‚Äòrabbit‚Äô meat. All in all not a filling meal, but the Fish tasted good, so not a total bummer. Mama F came by a little later with shallow rock with water in it. ‚ÄúI heated up this water, hopefully its safe to drink.‚Äù She said offering me a drink. I drank a little, the hot water tasted like cooked fish and berries, not the normal flavor I like my water. I thanked her and drank a little more, and she moved on to other people. Before trying to lie down for the night I went and found Staff Sergeant Samuel. She had appropriated one of the axes and was keeping watch on the east side of the clearing. ‚ÄúAnything to report,‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo. After first interaction, we haven‚Äôt seen tooth or scale of the little monsters. They could be just inside the treeline for all we know or they could be miles from here. We just don‚Äôt know,‚Äù She said watching the path. ‚ÄúThey seemed hesitant to cross the water. So hopefully they'll not cross over just yet.‚Äù Srg. Samuel glanced side long at me and replied, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll I‚Äôm not going to assume that their not going to cross. We‚Äôll be prepared in any case. I won't feel safe till we at least have a wall between, us and those creatures.‚Äù I nodded in agreement and watch with her till the sun set. I woke sometime in the middle of the night to something I haven't heard since I was a little kid camping with my family in Yellowstone National Park. The long howl drifted on the wind from somewhere far off. It waxed and waned for several minutes. Finally it died down, and it went quiet. I wonder if I could fall back to sleep, with my nerves so unsettled. Then just at the edge of my hearing range from the south came answering howls. Not just one voice, but many. It was too far away for me to make anything out for sure, but there were many different pitches and were held for different amounts of time. Almost everyone was up now listening to the howls. Shocked and pail faces looked at each other. The only thing I knew for sure was without a doubt those were wolf howls. I will never forget the sound of wolves howls. That night, long ago were my brother and I and our parents sat in our camper as a pack of wolves sat not far from us and howled was seared into my memory. Where ever we were there were wolves out there. It almost almost made me believe we were still somewhere at home. That is until I looked and saw many people looking up into the night sky. I looked up too. There sitting in the sky was A moon. Not our moon, this moon look smaller and at its north end an giant crater could be seen. And ridding not too far behind the first moon a smaller moon followed the first. Bright blue light shine off the small moon and a more familiar shine came from the first moon. We were not on earth for sure now. My heart shrank a little with this knowledge. I knew that we were not going home, where every home was we were out here on our own. Unable to get back to sleep, I went to relieve Sergeant Samuel. When I got there another man was waiting there. Sergeant Samuel nowhere in site. The man gave me salute. ‚ÄúPrivate First Class Francis O‚ÄôMalley, USMC. I relived the Staff Sergeant an hour ago, Sir.‚Äù I nodded back at him. I had seen the Marine at the Renaissance Festival the week before, several times in fact. He had been with several other guys at the time too. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt get back to sleep, Sir?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúNo, not after hearing those wolves, and seeing the Two moons,‚Äù I explained. O‚ÄôMalley nodded, and pointed to the horizon. ‚ÄúWell not just two moons,‚Äù he said as I followed his pointed finger. There on the horizon a curve of another moon was just peeking. ‚ÄúIt's been coming up since I‚Äôve on watch.‚Äù I marveled at that fact. The moon was just barely visible a slight sliver on the horizon. ‚ÄúThat's one slow moon,‚Äù I commented. I was slightly startled when Sergeant Samuel‚Äôs voice came from behind us. ‚ÄúIt was trying to get up an hour before O‚ÄôMalley relieved me. It feels like the first two blasted past it.‚Äù Private O‚ÄôMalley came to attention. Samuels waved him off. ‚ÄúAre there any other military folks?‚Äù I question. ‚ÄúNo one who was currently serving,‚Äù was the reply from Samuels. ‚ÄúWhat about the guys I saw you were with during the Renaissance Festival, O‚ÄôMalley?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey left two days ago. Once my little brother had been ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù from the jousting tournament, he and the guys left to go to the beach. I was going back home after the Festival. I‚Äôve got in enough trouble on the beach in the past, so I didn‚Äôt want to go.‚Äù He reminisced. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some people who retired from all branches here. Just not a whole lot. Doc Bitterbeer said he was in the Brazilian medical corp for a couple of years, but got booted out. And I‚Äôve talked to a former British Royal Engineer, Margret was in it from 18 till she was 25. She the closest to an officer we have. But she‚Äôs too gunshy from her experience in Afghanistan, so she‚Äôll be little help if it ever comes to a fight. All the rest are willing and ready to help. I‚Äôve talked to them throughout the day.‚Äù I digested this information, and watch the third moon try rise. Finally I felt tired enough to fall back to sleep. I went back to where my campfire was, and laid down near to it.	stories

idea for new druid subclass	so I had idea for a new druid subclass: circle of the swarm. it's a bug themed subclass where you pick a type of swarm from the list and gain specific perks. honeybee: create and enchant honey to give buffs and heal your party. mosquito: poison and annoy opponents while buffing yourself with their blood spider: build webs to hinder opponent movement and get to climb up walls ant: being able to swarm opponents with different ant types that have different effects dung beetle: create balls of dung that gives disadvantage on opponents this subclass is still being created and I'm looking for help on creating it. edit: I'm thinking of letting the druid turn into a swarm as a wild shape	DnD
I‚Äôm so anxious about getting older that it‚Äôs ruining my time being young. How do I stop?	I‚Äôm 23F, for context. Something changed the day I turned 23, and it was this realisation that I no longer feel obnoxiously, untouchably young. I put an immense amount of pressure on myself to overachieve, as well as an immense amount of pressure on the way I look. Every single day, I sit and stew in my anxiety about getting older, worried that I may never achieve anything truly impressive before 25. I‚Äôve started convincing myself I‚Äôm getting wrinkles, and have begun using a concoction of different anti-ageing serums. I find myself feeling bitter and jealous of anyone younger than me, and playing numbers games over and over in my head trying to convince myself I‚Äôm still young and still have my whole life ahead of me. I turn 24 in a few months and I really, really need to find a way to tackle this anxiety. It‚Äôs consumed me and ruined my year of being 23. I find myself fantasising that I stumble upon my birth certificate and find out that I‚Äôm actually a year YOUNGER than I think I am, ha. The idea soothes me, because I‚Äôd feel like I still get to be in my early twenties for a little longer, still get to be enviably young. It‚Äôs gotten to the point now where it‚Äôs really, really affecting my mental health and quality of life. How can I stop obsessing over this?	Advice

Enerveration and dmg immunities	If a warlock were to cast and succeed on enerveration (deals 4d8 necrotic and they heal half of that) or a similar spell against a creature with immunity to necrotic dmg, would they still be able to heal half the damage or would it nullify that altogether? im assuming they wouldnt be able to but wanted some other thoughts on it. EDIT: and also kinda related, if they had Resistance, would they heal for the same ammount or half of the half damage it took.	DMAcademy

My job has amassed roughly 1 million individual staples - enough to last over 20 years.	I work in a typical office and every few weeks the manager puts in an office supply order. Typical things that run out quick are paperclips, pens, post it notes, tape, printer paper, ink, etc. When he orders stuff online I think hes just got in the habit of ordering a box of staples each time. The thing is, the box comes with 5 cartons of 5,000 staples each, so 25,000 staples. We do not use nearly this many. 5,000 staples would probably last months. But he's been ordering a box each time along with the other supplies out of habit and because they're cheap. I was just looking through a 'junk drawer' we have and there are tons of these boxes of staples. 25,000 to a box, and dozens of boxes, we have I'm sure well over a million staples. We have enough staples to last this company for, not kidding, the next 25 years.	CasualConversation

Opinion - All of the Insidious movies are good	Not saying this is unpopular, just my opinion after watching The Last Key today. Some of the movies are better than others, and there are definitely things I think each one could have done better, but none of them fall completely flat or aren't worth seeing if you enjoy any of them. Have to say I was pretty impressed that we got 3 sequels that were just as worthwile. If you like any of them, or are a fan of this brand of 2010s horror, there's four movies worth adding to your list.	horror

I think BF6 will return faith to the community.	One of my biggest frustrations with Dice is when the team split for Battlefront 1. I knew resources diverted would impact the Battlefield series and 5 is proof of that, hell even the launch of Battlefront 2 shows a lot. I feel like with the whole team back together creativity will spark within them. Hopefully the upper management changes because of this too, because we know they have been a huge factor in the downfall of V. I think everyone should be cautious and have a wait and see approach to the next game but I am optimistic about 6.	BattlefieldV

Terrible ping and jitter from ISP, except for in the middle of the night	"Hi [r/HomeNetworking](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/), I have been having such terrible latency and jitter on my home network, especially compared to friends who live in the same town as me. My neighbor down the street from me also has this exact same problem. I was hoping you guys can help me understand the problem and make suggestions on how I can get this resolved. I am on the Rogers ""Ignite Internet Gigabit"" plan, offering 1Gbps down and 30Mbps up. **My Problem** The ping and jitter of the network provided by my ISP (Rogers) to my home is typically brutal, except during the middle of the night, say between 2am-7am, where my ping and jitter goes back to ideal levels. Here are some PingPlotter graphs to show what I'm talking about: [https://imgur.com/a/Yse9sjx](https://imgur.com/a/Yse9sjx) Throughout many months and probably a dozen calls to my ISP, they continuously disregarded this issue as something to do with my local setup, but I am quite positive that everything on my setup is working as intended. I have replaced coaxial cables and ethernet cables, and I have also had my CODA-4582 modem replaced. I have even purchased an expensive Asus router, flashed asuswrt-merlin firmware with FreshJR QoS, and put the modem in bridge mode, but this still did not help. It should be noted this issue persists even when plugged directly into the CODA-4582 modem that they supplied me with. About a month ago, I called them again and they FINALLY acknowledged something was wrong with their network, so they created some sort of ticket and said they will have it fixed in approximately 2 days. It's been over a month since they have opened this ticket, and there has still been no resolution, and no updates on their progress towards a resolution. I feel very pessimistic about this situation actually being resolved. My ISP is the only provider of high-speed internet to my home, and it feels like my attempts to get them to fix my internet problems are futile. **So, I have some questions:** * Is it likely that my ISP is taking my complaints seriously? * Are the PingPlotter test results I shared alarming in any way? * Is there a suggested way I can get my ISP to actually work to resolve this issue? * Does anyone have a suggestion as to what the issue on my ISP's network actually is? If there's anything else you would like to suggest or note for me, I would love to hear any and all of your input!"	HomeNetworking
Ever since his death, Kobe has been overrated.	Firstly, I think Kobe is one of the greatest players in basketball history and I don't think he is bad. Now that that is clarified, ever since Kobe's death I have seen more people than ever putting Kobe above Lebron James on GOAT lists for basketball. The popular opinion before his death was 1st Jordan, 2nd Lebron, and 3rd Kobe but now all of a sudden Kobe is almost always 2nd. I have no problem with people thinking Kobe is better than Lebron but I don't think it's fair nor would Kobe want to be considered better than another player, purely because he is dead and the other player is alive.	unpopularopinion

I Calculated How Much Steve Wrote For Each Album	A while back I did the who wrote what series, and using that info, plus adding up all the seconds of all the parts he helped write I gathered these results: Nursery Cryme: 6:12 (15.7%) Foxtrot: 7:16 (14.2%) SEBTP: 11:00 (20.4%) The Lamb: 12:00 (12.7%) there‚Äôs a big margin of error for this one ATOTT: 7:25 (14.5%) WAW: 9:42 (19.1%) Kinda strange he didn‚Äôt think he got enough on WAW, especially since he has the lead credit on three songs, plus the middle of 11th Earl of Mar. Although when you consider that One For The Vine already exceeds the length of everything Steve wrote, it‚Äôs kinda understandable.	Genesis
Starting Again	This time last year I was hovering around the 250 mark, 25 pounds down from my previous weight. While that was nowhere near my ultimate goal weight, I felt really good about myself for losing some of the weight and was experiencing some of the benefits that come with weight loss. I hovered around that weight the rest of the summer, which I was slightly annoyed about but thought at least I was maintaining and not gaining, right? Things took a turn in September when I got my first full-time job in my field after graduating a few months prior, which resulted in moving to a new city and state alone. At the same time I was broken up with out of the blue and didn‚Äôt get any closure about it. That first month was really hard for me in a lot of ways and I ate far more than I should because I knew it would at least make me feel better at the moment. For the first time I was buying all of my own groceries with no one there to have an opinion on what was in my cart and I suddenly had access to all of the restaurant delivery services in my new town, so I went crazy with all of that and created a new, unhealthy norm for myself. I was always aware I was making bad choices but just let myself sink further into it. Now I‚Äôve gained that weight back and a little more. I‚Äôm at my all-time highest weight and I really just can‚Äôt stand it. I don‚Äôt like the way I look, the way I feel, the way my clothes fit. I don‚Äôt want to spend my whole life feeling like this. This past week I did an overhaul on my groceries, deleted my food delivery apps, and logged everything that I ate. I went over my allotted calories a few days but didn‚Äôt binge. I ended up still staying under the calorie threshold for the week so it was a success. I know I‚Äôll mess up but I want to be able to fall back in line when I do. I want to change. I know I‚Äôm capable of it.	loseit
Its funny how people don't do certain things because there's already 1 other person doing it when almost all industries have thousands of competitors.	Like the title says. What should be a reason to justify what you want to do is actually something people use to hold themselves back. If 100 other people can do it, you can too. Originality is a lie, if your idea works, even if someone else did it first, do it.	Entrepreneur

Covid-19 Discussion Thread	Hello everyone, as we have been trying to figure out a way to deal with the large influx of people wanting to discuss Covid-19 on a non Calgary level, on /r/Calgary we have decided to have a daily Covid-19 thread. Please use this thread to discuss anything you want about Covid-19. This thread won't be replacing Covid-19 discussion on a local level, so if you have something Calgary specific about Covid-19 you will still be able to post about it and have a seperate discussion.

I got rolled forward /s	Damn I am furious. I was planning on playing through the HOT today, but when I logged in it was already completed. I am not sure what to do, but I want to wake some people up and schedule a meeting where I request everything that ever existed as basic compensation. I haven't read the forums,discord,prev reddit posts, I came here to vent before anything. I am already playing another game that has a support staff and magician on duty (as of yesterday) 24 hours, 0 minutes, 0,0002077 seconds / 7. Anything below that is unacceptable.

Holy fuck, everything we've done so far has just been a shot in the dark; listening for something to ring when we hit it!	"An educated guess just allows you to know the general direction to aim. Cutting edge science is basically ""well we've done this, so how about this?"" We are tickling the Universe's metaphorical belly and seeing what reactions we get out of it. We are learning more and more everyday about things our ancestors thought to be fantasy. Material has been realized to only be an illusion, and hell, touch/chemical reactions are governed by the repulsive/attractive force of little ""balls"" of electricity and their willingness/resilience to exchange themselves. I mean, shit, those little bastards are one of the main reasons we can even see. They just fuckin release light when calming down after being excited.. The *fuck?* What in the fuck is this *thing* we inhabit, and why is it so absurd!?"	Psychonaut

[Q] How is pricing determined?	I've noticed that the price differences between sites like steam and 3rd party sites aren't always proportional. For example, the karambit tiger tooth FN is $630 on steam and $425 on 3rd party sites, meaning that the 3rd party site is 67% of the price. The talon knife tiger tooth FN is 71% cheaper on 3rd party sites. I have sent trade offers where I am overpaying if you calculate with 3rd party sites, but they think the offer is a lowball bc on steam I am underpaying. What platform should I primarily use when evaluating and sending trade offers?	GlobalOffensiveTrade
CMV: Human‚Äôs worth is evaluated by what he/she can contribute to society/corporations	How can we evaluate a human‚Äôs worth? Growing up in an environment that keeps telling me I have to be useful to be acknowledged. Even though I know that mindset is partly false in moral side, I can‚Äôt get rid of it and I‚Äôm clinging on to it. Currently working in a corporate company that just cares how much money I can make for them. Even people with shittiest personalities are praised and get promotions because they do a good job. Even friendships and relationships are basically exchange-ships. We human beings are selfish creatures in the end.	changemyview

Learning ClojureScript with a Snake game	"Hello everybody! I have some free time for weeks, so I decided to learn Clojure. I went through the entire book Clojure for the Brave and True, taking notes and copying/playing with the code. I enjoyed it, it's a great book, with simple (but deep) explanations. At the same time, I developed a snake game in ClojureScript for people to train to use `hjkl` instead of the arrow key, mostly for Vim. * Here are the sources: https://github.com/Phantas0s/snake.hjkl * Here's the game: https://matthieucneude.com/snake/ I would love to have some feedback. I tried to group mutations at the same place as much as I could, trying to have mostly pure functions. My goal is really to understand the advantage of the ""functional way of thinking"". * Do you see any improvement I could make? * Do I respect the ""good practices"" of Clojure? * I don't really use namespaces. Do you think I could decompose my code with namespaces? Thank you!"	Clojure

My work just got a lot of Matilda Jane in...	So I work at a consignment shop and we get a lot of MLM clothing in (Lularoe, Agnes & Dora, Matilda Jane). Recently, we had this lady who was a trunk keeper for Matilda Jane come and drop off at least two car-fulls of that junk, tags still on it & everything. My boss has mentioned that after we go through it we should live stream all of the pieces we got in. I‚Äôm pretty sure she got this idea from the lady who dropped it all off. On one hand I understand that she would want to do that in order to try to make money & to let people know we have, but on the other hand I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll ask me to do it since I‚Äôm in charge of all our social media pages. Does anyone have any advice on how I should talk to her about this in case she does ask me to do it? We have posted some MJ stuff on our page in the past, but I feel like live streaming all the pieces we have is different.	antiMLM

Back to square 1	I haven't posted in over a week, since my last relapse. It is amazing how all consuming this addiction is, yet so easy to hide it from others. Of course they all sense that there's something off. My work performance slips, I'm less engaged with my family, and less affectionate with my wife. I PMOd just now, at work, after being in the bathroom for over an hour on my go to pic chat site. I am that much further from my goal now of being able to get and maintain an erection with my wife. I avoid being affectionate with her so that she doesn't get in the mood and then finds out I can't perform in bed. It's sad. Nothing to do now but try again. She's leaving Thursday for a long weekend to visit her parents. Pray for me that I can use that time to be strong and rebuild my resolve, willpower, and stamina. Thanks.	NoFap
How do you form Meaningful Connections with Other People?	25F. I'm hoping for some advice. I've never had lasting friendships and only one brief relationship. How do you form connections with people? What do you talk about? Any activities or actions I can take? I desperately need to learn how to let people in and get to know me personally, and I need to learn how to get to know others deeply as well. A little background: I was able to meet people at university and majored in theatre, but my friendships were all shallower than I realised and over the last few years I've lost most of the friends I used to have. My childhood/teen years were full of moving cities and starting from scratch so there's no one from back then who knows me now. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and gender dysphoria and have been transitioning for about a year now. I've always wanted relationships but I have major issues with my body and always feel like I'm years behind my peers in social experiences, career, community, and general life experience, so I've always felt too boring/naive/ugly/useless to actually meet anyone or let them into my life. I'm planning to go back into therapy after lockdown ends but I wanted to reach out now because I'm really struggling. Anyway, any help/advice would be really, really appreciated. I'm not really looking to meet anonymous/people over the internet, sorry if you're a kind soul who would offer to be friends. ‚ô•	relationship_advice
Work Fun	I just had the a great wank in the office toilet. Sifting through reddit and getting so turned on I decided to look for something to use for ass play. Behold the humble dry board marker (fresh from the packet, sanitised and cleaned with boiling water). Lubed my ass with spit, sat on the seat 180degrees as u normally would and got some dick content on screen. Managed to manoeuvre my ass over the seat and fuck myself with the pen whilst wanking. Needless to say the combo of my ass being toyed, my dick being stroked and some femboy riding a massive dick I didnt last long before cumming all over the toilet. With the office being so quiet I can be as loud or active as I want. Dicks gone hard again writing this, so......	gaysexconfessions
Nearly 5 years since I lost my sister (CW Murder)	On Thursday, it'll be 5 years since I walked in my mums door and heard my sisters life had been taken by a man she tried to help. The whole story is far more messed up than that. We are a pretty normal family, she was a great mum, with a good job, but when you say murder, people make sweeping assumptions and it breaks my heart. She left behind a daughter who was 12 and is 18 later this month, and every time I look at her at this time of year, my heart breaks. I miss my sister every single day, but for some reason this time of year with the anniversary, her birthday and my nieces birthday it sucks so much more for us. I still can't believe I lost my first best friend.	GriefSupport

Where to go after create-react-app?	"I feel like in order to learn more, I should get away from create-react-app for my next project. A quick summary of my next project is that it will be kind of a social thing, with user accounts, posting photos, filling out some parameters, etc. Mostly a learning project, but it's for a niche that might find it useful, so at least a little scalability. I'll probably use Postgres since that's kind of my go-to and I didn't love Mongo, but feel free to talk me out of it. Anyway, for my past projects, I just used create-react-app, deployed to heroku with their postgres module. I'd like to move on from Heroku perhaps, since I've had some issues with downtime and my server needing to be manually restarted every once in a while. Could be my own problem, but either way I'm trying to kind of spread out and understand more, so wanted to switch that up. But the bulk of what I want to accomplish is to kind of be as ""up to date"" in this project as I can, using some of the new stuff, learning about hooks, and mainly not using create-react-app. I want to be more hire-able so I'm trying to get with the times. I'm not an expert by any means (as you can see by me saying I've never used hooks), so I'm just curious what you all would say is the next step. Next.js? Parcel? Manually doing webpack? And any opinions on hosting would be great too. I'm not expecting a million users, and of course I don't want to pay a ton, but something on the professional end would be nice. Thanks."	reactjs
Quit smoking and bought a Venu with the money I've saved - I love it.	First I got the vivoactive 4s. It was great but too small. I sold it to my girlfriend and got vivoactive 4. It was a too big and ugly for my taste and hand size. I returned it and got a Venu on the same trip - and It's perfect. It does everything I expected and more. I use it for tracking my health and mental health, running, playing football and doing other cardio. Sleep algorythm could be better, but I'd say it has been pretty accurate for me. Stress and body battery seem to correlate with how I feel. Also, [it looks great.](https://imgur.com/a/Qxj8hwU) I can wear it as a part of my outfit almost anywhere, which can't be said about the other garmin watches.

Did your mental health get better after coming out?	I know all the coming out basics. Don't do it until you're safe...etc For the past year/year and a half I have been feeling more anxious and more vulnerable to anxiety and stress. I think being closeted in a religious household makes it normal to feel that way. Did you mental health got better after completely coming out or am I just overthinking things?	askgaybros
[Help] Puppy blues.	Hey, all. I guess I‚Äôm in need of some emotional support. Maybe a lot of emotional support. I had an anxiety attack last night, and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm making the right choice. Tomorrow I‚Äôm brining home a dog I‚Äôve agreed to adopt. He‚Äôs a staff favorite at the shelter, and has just somehow managed to be overlooked for about 2 months now, when most of their dogs are moved within 2 weeks. And I‚Äôm already freaking out. When we adopted our last dog back in 2012 or so, I was a mess for the first week or two. I needed my own two week shut down. It was constant feelings of having made a mistake, being unable to handle a dog, guilt and shame because I acted impulsively...and then eventually I got over it. Then I just had a lot of anxiety about his care and safety (I‚Äôm an anxious person). Now? Similar feelings. I have a lot of guilt because my two cats are incredibly timid. They live with dogs now, but anything larger than they are scares them. This dog is about 50 pounds. I‚Äôm going to feel so bad watching them hide for a few days, and I‚Äôm concerned my old lady cat won‚Äôt ever get over it. I‚Äôm also feeling trapped. It won‚Äôt be as easy to just decide to leave the house for the day and just go do whatever I want. Part of me feels like I don‚Äôt even want a dog, but that I‚Äôm just bored and looking for something to keep me busy. I have a dog and 2 cats already, and care for my mom‚Äôs dog on top of that. And I‚Äôm not ready for the battle that‚Äôs going to come from my partner. He‚Äôs lazy, and won‚Äôt even change the cat litter or walk our current dog. The one we decided on is higher energy than our chihuahua, and I don‚Äôt think he understands/realizes that he‚Äôs going to have to at least help with walks that are much more than just a quick loop around the block a couple times a week. And I‚Äôm lazy enough that I don‚Äôt want to be the only one taking care of three dogs. And the barking. Our chihuahua is a big barker. The shelter said this new guy isn‚Äôt too vocal, but that could change. I really don‚Äôt know if I have the patience to add more noise. When our last dog died, we both said we didn‚Äôt want any more dogs. For my fianc√©, his reasoning was because he didn‚Äôt want to deal with death anymore. For me, it was because, as much as I love dogs, I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the inconveniences again. I also still hold a ton of guilt from our dog‚Äôs death. He had cancer, and we didn‚Äôt do absolutely everything we could for him, and we also euthanized before he was ready. Our last few days with him, I couldn‚Äôt even look at him. I‚Äôll never get that back. And, let‚Äôs face it, dogs cost money. This is going to set us back just slightly in terms of saving for the house we want, or the other things we want to buy. Not a ton, but enough. But at the same time I think this could be good for me? My health has suffered since our dog died a year ago, and I‚Äôve gained weight and pretty much stopped moving since our chihuahua requires so little. I do love dogs, and I do see a future with more dogs. And up until I verbally agreed to adopt this dog, I felt I was ready. It was once I hung up from the call that I started to feel anxious and regretful.	dogs

GoT Winners and Losers Pt 5	"You know the drill. I take GoT show characters and sort them neatly into the winner or loser category. Sort of like the Sorting Hat but not having anything to do with entry-level nerd shit for children. Jon Snow: Loser It's simple. Jon Snow is a loser because he died and came back. You're dead. that's it. you made it out. you did it. you're done. jon snow had that opportunity and he wasted it. that's not just my jealousy talking, either. think about it. come back for what? more wars? more incest? more cold weather, shitty food and atrocities? come on, snow. stay down. on the other hand, no offense to jamie lannister, i almost ruled him a winner for not wanting the throne. he knows he'd suck as a ruler. he knows he's weak on immigration. The Hound: Winner Winner winner chicken dinner. you ever heard someone say ""i would kill for a drink?"" that's the hounds life motto. all this man wanted to do was booze. but here comes a position as guard for King Joffrey ""Giga Chad"" Baratheon. fine he does it. here comes a war. so fine he fights in it. everything the world has to throw at him he takes like a man so he can get back to drinking. the hound is also the only one in the show that sorts out the supreme brat Arya Stark. all this uppity girl needed was to be yelled at, threatened, mocked and slapped. sandor teaches arya all the stuff that her parents, brothers, friends and aunt couldn't because, well. you know. he also hates rum, which is powerful and right. ale and wine only for sandor ""the mandor"" clegane. this is Westeros, not the club."	freefolk
How do you explain the brilliance of the N64 and it's games?	Hi all, I was having this discussion with a friend today, about how incredible it is that the N64 had titles like Mario 64 (with extremely fluid movement), Zelda, Super Smash Bros, Goldeneye, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Star Fox, Banjo, Conkers, Yoshi, and Paper Mario. How did this happen? Where did all these original ideas come from? How was there such expertise over a brand new dimension? I get some of these titles had 2d versions, but the leap from 2D to 3D is huge! It feels like unbelievable talent at work here, I'm in awe thinking about all the games that came out on the N64! I can't imagine being in a studio, working on new hardware, new IP, in 3D, and executing it so well. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.	truegaming
Ending of Apokolips War	I really liked this movie I‚Äôm just a little confused on the ending. Couldn‚Äôt have Barry just reset the timeline whenever he felt like it? Why did he have to wait until the end of the movie to do it? I get it was a last resort but I don‚Äôt see why because the world was shit throughout the whole movie, it‚Äôs hard to think that he went back to change reality when the Atlantans and Amazons were at war but didn‚Äôt do the same when Darkseid Knuckle Fucked Earth to shreds and only even thought about it when Constantine told him at the end? Also I guess they all die at the end? Like their timeline just fades and they‚Äôre at peace with it? Or are they going to be reincarnated onto a different life somehow? Movie was really good though.

Was the Ace of Spades made by Tex Mechanica?	The Tex Mechanica foundry has made a few hand cannons, one of which is the [Silvered Maverick Mk. 41](https://destinypedia.com/Silvered_Maverick_Mk._41), a rare D1 hand cannon. I also suspect the legendary [Red Hand IX](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Hand_IX) (D1), the rare [Azimuth DSU](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Azimuth_DSu), and the uncommon [Mos Ultima II](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Mos_Ultima_II) (D2) to also have been made by them. If you've seen these hand cannons, you can't deny that they share -almost- the same frame as the Ace. This led me to believe that Cayde-6 had it custom-made, as it is mentioned in the Ace of Spades [Grimoire card](https://ishtar-collective.net/cards/ace-of-spades?highlight=ace+of+spades). P.S: for further context, here's this [lore entry.](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/ancient-apocalypse-greaves?highlight=tex+mechanica)	DestinyLore
PFE might be about to blow this week	So I have a birdy who was telling me about these reports of Pfizer looking to outsource production of certain drugs in order to transition completely to this vaccine. This birdy told me two other NY facilities are now currently preparing to do so as Pfizer must have received some positive feedback from these trials so far. They expanded even further beyond their original outsourcing to a facility on Long Island. Keep an eye on Pfizer, and it might be worth throwing some money on end of may and end of June calls just in case they get some sort of serious hype behind their vaccine. It‚Äôs up on the news, but that news will be expanded upon here shortly. West pharma, gerresheimer, hospira, pyramid, etc. Bonus play: Agilent calls and sell before earnings.	wallstreetbets

People asking people's buying/selling advice	"Why is there post after post after post regarding ""should I buy now or wait a little to buy the dip""?

No one here is getting any kind of commission or anything off your crypto investment decisions. Not to mention, I feel like it breaks the avoid repetition rule. Same with best places to buy crypto.

The Crimson Leviathan	# TL;DR A new boss, the Crimson Leviathan, its home being at a pillar of Netherrack and Crimson greenery (reddery?), a new ranged weapon the Boomerfang, Imagine your peacefully riding your strider through the lava oceans of the Nether towards an unnatural pillar piecing the surface with Crimson vegetation taking its *roots* there. As you get closer you hear a mighty roar as the elusive Crimson Leviathan bursts out of the surface and coils around the column, you're in for one helluva fight! # What is it? The Crimson Leviathan is a massive worm-like animal, with spikes chaotically piecing from its skin and the occasional Crimson plant. It is a whopping 18 blocks long and 2 blocks wide, earning its title of Leviathan. It is said that after a colossal time hibernating, *someone* woke it up, making it very, very angry. # Where do I find it? As stated before, the strange looking pillar is said to be its 'nest' housing the only other traces of its species, yes this thing is a mother, enjoy the guilt you feel after killing it and discovering its probably unfertile eggs, now knowing that it was only defending its children and would probably stop attacking if you just left. There is only one Leviathan in a world at a time, though the pillars are as common as Strongholds, the only thing they are holding, however, is an empty nests and a few skulls. NOTE: The Crimson Leviathan will respawn at a different pillar once defeated after 2 10 in-game days. # Attacks How will this thing kill you, you ask? In many, many very painful ways. It has a few attacks it can do, it will sink under the lava, swim around for a bit, then violently emerge at the location you were about 3 seconds ago, it can also take a delicious gulp of magma then spit it at you, setting you on fire if it hits you, etc. # The Loot So, you've killed it, either legitimately or using some exploit, it's done. What is your reward? Juicy loot. The Crimson Leviathan drops 1 Boomerfang and 12 Netherite Scrap. Your probably wondering 'What the hell is a Boomerfang?' A new ranged weapon. Upon throwing it, it will leave your inventory and travel in a straight line of a max of 40 blocks, at about a sheep's running speed, then return to you at an equal speed. It will deal 6 hearts of damage, and pierce enemies but only on the return trip. Its one great flaw, however, is it cannot be enchanted, but is unbreakable, due to once being the Leviathan's tooth. I hope you liked my idea!	minecraftsuggestions
Maintaining highly sensitive files in the cloud	"Hello Community. I am new to this ""privacy conscious"" mindset and I need advice. I want to keep copies of highly sensitive files in the cloud and I want to do it as SAFELY as possible. These files are JPEGs, PDFs, Word and Excel that I already have uploaded to services like Dropbox, One Drive, Box and iCloud. Until now, I was under the impression that those cloud providers did encrypt every uploaded file... but like I said, I am new and reading some of the posts in here made me realize my sensitive files may not be safe. I've read about Cryptomator but I am under the impression that this software can only encrypt files BEFORE these are uploaded. So here are my questions: 1) Are there any tools I can use to encrypt the files already uploaded? 2) Which one of the cloud providers I use (Dropbox, One Drive, Box and iCloud) you think is the safest and most trustworthy? 3) Is there any other user-friendly cloud service provider safer than the aforementioned ones? 4) What method would you use to keep your highly sensitive files stored in the cloud? Not sure if this info is relevant but i use a combination of Mac, Windows, Ubuntu and iPhone for hardware. I really appreciate any advice you can give me and thank you for your time. Have a safe day."	privacy
Entitled Mother thinks her kid is entitled to go outside despite COVID-19	Hey everyone, and possibly Redditor ;). Long time dweller, first time poster. For context, EM: Entitled Mother (duh), P1 - Police Officer 1, P2 - Police Officer 2, C - Cadet. As you all know with the current situation with COVID-19, the lockdown in the UK has forced everyone to stay home. While this rule applies to everyone, the EM doesn't think it applies to her. It was a normal day, and I was completing some police cadet work (I'm a senior police cadet) when I receive an email from my trainer. The email read something along the lines of: volunteering to help patrol my area for people breaking the lockdown rules. Of course this would be a never again experience so I accepted! A week later, I had met at my local police station, along with another cadet (of course with PPE, e.g. face masks and social distancing). Eventually we headed out. While there were a few people about, we had told them to disperse back, and sure enough everyone listening and no-one questioned me and headed home immediately. I was having an amazing time, and felt proud of helping the country stay safe from this calamity that fell upon us. I thought the rest of the day will go well. &#x200B; BOY, was I wrong &#x200B; At \[insert park name here\] was an Entitled Mother and her Nice Kid. As usual, we told her to pack up and leave. Nothing wrong about that right? Wrong. The entitled mother *stood up and looked at P1 straight in the face* Here's how the conversation entailed: &#x200B; **Me**: Ma'am please leave this area and head home immediately. **EM**: *stands up and faces P1* **EM**: My kid is dyyyying at home, he needs to be out! **P1**: Ma'am this is not a valid reason to be out, head home or we will be forced to arrest or fine you. **EM**: Yes it is what do you know you're not an NHS worker, you're only a police officer! *At this point the EM is standing horrendously close to the officers at this point* **P2**: Step away from him now. **Me**: Ma'am step away from him, you must observe social distancing don't you understand that? **EM**: You're just kids what do you know you f\*\*\*\* c\*\*\*. **P2**: He is saying to step away from P1, so do so now, and NEVER swear at my cadets. *My fellow cadet gets involved* **C**: Ma'am unless you WANT to be prosecuted, head home now. **P2**: I will be forced to arrest you if you do not move. *All hell breaks loose after the Entitled Mother assaults P2* **EM**: That's what you get for implying i have the coronavirus! *Keep in mind that we did not say that at all* &#x200B; I get annoyed quickly, but then she PUSHES the other cadet and P1 to the point they fall on the floor. This is when my insticts kick in and I pepper spray here and detained her while some people exercising calls the police. While this is happening, I get kicked in the hand and my god, did that hurt. &#x200B; Her NK finally speaks up, around the same time backup arrives. **NK**: MUM WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DO THIS, YOU ALWAYS MAKE A SCENE AND PUSH ANYONE THAT TELLS YOU TO DO SOMETHING *This shocks us all* Upon looking at her history, she had been arrested before for charges of assault. Eventually, she gets taken away in a police van, while the kid's dad was called to pick him up. Meanwhile the kid was apologising profusely for his acts. We tell him it's not your fault. He smiles and leaves. &#x200B; PS: I broke 2 of my fingers while this happened, look below to see proof. &#x200B; I hope this gets on Redditor's video, but thanks for reading! https://preview.redd.it/mrolsc3o55y41.jpg?width=267&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=261b5f3014ade362ac2a92a27e178fe6c8f74ef8	redditoryt
Checking whether the cell above is a ‚Äòhigher‚Äô or ‚Äòlower‚Äô value in a table.	Hello, I am new to excel and am using to record my stats in a video game. I record my stats for each game and the rank I have after the game. For example, say the ranks are bronze, silver and gold, if I go from silver to gold it would be a rank up so I would like the cell to turn green, and if i deranked (i.e. silver to bronze) it should turn red. I have absolutely no idea how to do this. Thank you for the help :) Edit: There are 22 different ranks in the game, I realise this would be useful information.	excel
I (30f) visited a sleazy sex club on my lunch break last summer and had an incredible time	Last summer, I was a cooped up *housewife (committed relationship but I still work) and I was desperate for good cock. I decided to look up glory holes (sorry lol) but it felt dangerous. I saw a couple in reviews for sex shops and visited them but the vibe wasn‚Äôt right. I saw someone mention having a good time at a sex club on the west side of town. I researched it for weeks and everything seemed legit, but they were only open at night. I wanted to do everything in my power to stay safe and going at night wasn‚Äôt happening. I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck one day when I saw their daily special on the upcoming Friday was a Nooner session from 12pm - 5pm! I bought slutty panties and pasties to really get my stripper out. I made up my mind to go and told my boss I had a doctors appointment that Friday that might run long. As I drove over, my heart was pounding. I felt curious about what it would look like and about the bad reviews online, but I knew that only angry people leave reviews typically. I called ahead and asked if it was busy, and she said there were a few couples and single men still there and that it was winding down from earlier. When I saw the building and the small sign on the door, I was nervous and excited. I pulled up and parked with my heart beating through my chest, looking at the ten or so cars. While gathering courage, a guy pulled up next to me and hit his car door on my car lightly when he got out - we smiled and it was kind, and I didn‚Äôt feel judged or creeped out for being there like I thought I would. I rolled down my window to tell him it‚Äôs okay; he was a younger and slender guy with very pretty eyes and a smile. He asked me if I was going inside, and I hesitated. I had been planning on just driving away, but the friendliness and respect of this patron made me feel much more relaxed. I smiled and told him I‚Äôd be in soon after I relaxed. I wondered if that was true. I decided to just do it. I was nervous and confused at first, but the reception area was kind. They waved me in and I was flocked immediately by several men that I chose someone new from; an older guy with incredible salt and pepper hair. Introductions were made and I met Rene officially, a handsome older man who was well dressed worn a thick European accent. we made small talk about me being a first timer. He asked about my job and perked up when I said I was an engineer. He told me about the feeling he got building planes as an aviation engineer and that a plane he designed was taking off today. He asked if I‚Äôd like company - of course, I told him. We sat at the table and chairs for awhile and he told me about traveling to Boise for business, and I told him about San Francisco. We shared traveling woes and laughed. I asked him about the club and whether he came there often, and we discussed the different rooms and what they‚Äôre generally used for. I asked about the rules and etiquette, and he said anyone could take anything off and show as much as they want, gesturing to the naked man playing pool behind us. I told him it was difficult to hear him and get to know him and asked if there was a couch in another room where we could sit closer. He suggested a private room upstairs and told me that they‚Äôre cleaned vigorously and have fresh sheets down every time. I had seen on the reviews that the rooms were cute, so I told him sure - I‚Äôd love that. We were followed upstairs to the rooms by the attendant and a single man, and we walked by rooms that were being cleaned. He told me the room at the end was great; I followed. The door opened to an incredible room with a red light with mirrored walls and ceiling. The single male that followed us asked if we wanted company, and Rene answered no for us and we laughed, shutting the door slightly. He asked where I‚Äôd like to sit, the chairs or the bed, and I opted for the bed. He was a grey fox and smelled like expensive body wash and beard oil when I sat next to him. He rubbed my back and I put my things on the table while the attendant brought a condom, shutting the door after her. After chatting a bit more, I took my vest off and he smiled and said that I should take my shirt off, too. I smiled and sat back down, and he leaned in to kiss me. He tasted extremely fresh and smelled wonderful, so I had high hopes for his hygiene. I smiled and told him I‚Äôd been waiting to show off my pasties to someone and took off my shirt; with no bra, my huge tits bounced out and revealed my new lightning bolt pasties. He loved them and immediately started playing with my tits; I could see my nipples poking out hard under the pasties. After making out and kissing a bit, he removed his shirt and said he was overdressed. He still had his incredibly nice jeans, belt, and chuck Taylor‚Äôs on - so cute! We made out again and I said I was going to take my shorts off to show him something else, standing up and shimmying out of my vintage high waist shorts. I was wearing black lace panties with blue tie-up sides that were crotchless, but he couldn‚Äôt see that part yet. His eyes ate me up and he laid me back on the bed to admire me in the red light before stripping to his cute European boxer briefs. He fondled me and played with me through my panties when he discovered they were crotchless. He slid his boxers off and tossed them down while pushing me up on the bed gently and spreading my legs, still with my undies on. He spread my legs wide and ate me out gently while I watched my tits and my cute pasties in the mirror ceiling. He was incredibly skillful and had me near orgasm several times, which I kept pulling away from to save it. I told him he felt incredible and he pushed both of my legs up, exposing my pussy more and continued to eat. I asked what I could do to thank him and he gently pushed back on my legs to spread me wider and expose my freshly shaven asshole. He licked a couple of times under my pussy to gauge interest and I moaned to him that he felt amazing. His tongue dove down around my asshole and licked me slowly and deeply, gently tongueing my asshole and loosening me up. He worked his tongue inside my hole and grabbed my thick legs to pull my ass around his tongue, sliding it in to extend as far as it would go while keeping a thumb on my clit. After an incredible amount of time, I started bucking my hips and he returned to my pussy, suckling on my clit and pushing a finger in, then a second one. He fingered me deeply and slow at first, then upped the intensity to a deep vigorous finger fuck that had me squirming. I pulled away and laughed and told him he was amazing at that and that I wanted to repay him. He crawled on the bed next to me and showed me his cock, a good 7 inch thick cock that was neatly groomed and smelled like his body wash and fresh laundry. He pulled off my pasties and nibbled and sucked on my nipples gently, murmuring ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck‚Äù as he complimented my big tits and how perky and young they felt. I licked his tip and tasted him, slowly working him with my mouth until I got down to the base when he moaned loud and sent chills through me. I pushed my tongue down and licked hard for a while, working his shaft with my hand and smiling with his cock in my mouth while he watched my exposed ass and pussy through my panties in the mirror. He pulled out and told me to lick, which I did, smiling and giving him long, loving licks up and down his big cock. He groaned and told me how hot I was and kept muttering ‚Äúfuck‚Äù to himself. He gently held my head still and fucked my mouth slowly, then said he wanted to see and laid down on the bed. He spread his legs and I crawled between them smiling, locking his eyes while I started to suck on his tip. I worked him into my throat and let him rub his cock around deep past my gag reflex as he moaned. I slid him out and licked him again with eye contact and his body stared to shake gently. As I pulled my head up, he looked up at me desperately and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget my balls‚Äù and I smiled and dove back in, licking and sucking his balls while giggling at him. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I almost forgot‚Äù I said while he groaned deeply and put his head back. ‚ÄúThis is good stress relief right?‚Äù I asked him teasingly. He agreed, and I sat up on my knees. ‚ÄúI have 30 minutes before I have to get back to work, but I‚Äôm here and yours for the entire time‚Äù I whispered in his ear, making out with him and rubbing his cock. He pouted and whined and said okay, and asked me then to get on my knees and in the doggy position. He spread my ass cheeks wide and ate my pussy while smacking my big ass and grabbing onto my legs to pull me deeper onto his face and tongue. He slid his fingers into me again and moved his tongue to my exposed ass, tongue fucking me while rubbing my g-spot. I moaned and told him he was incredible as he moved his thumb to my asshole. He pushed his thumb against my hole and then inside of it, gripping me with two fingers in my pussy and his thumb deep in my ass. I couldn‚Äôt believe this is how he wanted to spend his 30 minutes, but I was in bliss. He used his other hand to rub my clit and smiled down at my body as I watched him through my hair, face down on the bed. I let him eat his fill and watched his cock get even bigger and thicker in the mirror as he took the hand on my clit and moved it to work his cock. He pulled up and got into position behind me, smacking my ass hard and asking me if I was ready for the condom. I sat up on my knees and said yes please and smiled at him. He shook his head and smiled in disbelief when I told him he was hot, and asked how old I was. When I told him, his eyebrows shot up and he said he was almost 30 years older than me and that i was younger than his daughter. I laughed and wiggled my ass at him, and he slid my panties off. He grabbed the condom and got it ready to roll on, then motioned with his cock to please suck a little more. I grinned and crawled over to him, sucking him slow and steady while he moaned every time he felt my tongue. I pulled back and he put the condom on. I asked where he wanted me and in what position, and he told me he already found his favorite and asked me to offer up to him in doggy style. I spread my legs and he got behind me, rubbing his cock on me and asking me to spread my legs more (I‚Äôm tall), plunging into me and moaning ‚Äúyes, perfect, right there‚Äù as he started fucking me. He slapped my ass hard and I pulled my hair up and held it as I was facedown, watching us in the mirror as he fucked all his stress from work into me and stretched out my pussy. I grabbed the sheets and pushed back into him, letting him grip my hips and fuck me deep while he moaned and told me how hot and perfect I was. I moaned as he grabbed my leg and pushed a finger inside my ass while fucking me, expanding it to two fingers when my moans quickened. He pulled his fingers out and gripped my hips, fucking me faster and faster until he was pounding my pussy open and gaped. I watched him in the mirror as he started arching his back, feeling his fingers dig into my hips and his grip tighten. I giggled and looked at him in the mirror and shook my ass while he fucked me and said ‚Äúgimme‚Äù to him smiling, and he lost it - he screamed and groaned so hard I knew every other room heard it, pounding into me with his face up toward the red light and his eyes closed. He took a total of 10 pumps to finish cumming, pushing into me deep and laughing and smiling with the release. I told him he felt amazing and he was so hot to watch as he bobbed the cum filled condom into me with his cock, softer but still big enough and thick enough to stay in me. He stayed there massaging my pussy with his worn out cock in me for another minute or so, rubbing my ass and back gently and squeezing my shoulders, murmuring to me how beautiful I was and how good I felt. I could tell he didn‚Äôt want to pull out; I spread my legs and rubbed his cock from the inside with a good kegel massage while he rode his bliss and came down softly. He pulled out and grabbed us two fresh towels, smiling and telling me I was crazy to keep saying how hot he was, and that he was hot thirty years ago. I laughed and told him that I had just gotten good proof that he still had it, and he laughed hard - no, still works, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm aiming for! He was incredibly shy and sweet. I got dressed and he asked me about what college was like and said he hoped I had a good time with him - I hugged him and told him it was incredible. He showed me videos of his plane taking off and the dashboards and systems that he had designed on his phone, and we chatted about Russia because it‚Äôs the only place that doesn‚Äôt have an aerial map released for the terrain software - it was fascinating. We grabbed our stuff and he got out a generous tip for the bartender as she also cleans the rooms. We headed downstairs past the other patrons smiling, and I enjoyed the looks and eyes on my big tits bouncing in my shirt without a bra, nipples hard and poking through the fabric without my pasties. We walked outside and I hugged him and he said he really hopes it was enjoyable and that he‚Äôd love to see me again - I hugged him back closely and told him definitely if I‚Äôm there again. I headed back to my car for a much needed break and a truck pulled up next to me as I was about to back up. It was a cute guy with a construction vest on that was checking me out. I rolled down my window and greeted him, feeling bold from the great time I‚Äôd just had. He smiled and asked, a lot of guys for you? And I said just one. we chatted about how it wasn‚Äôt busy anymore and he begged and joked for me to come inside, but I told him I only had 5 minutes before I leave to work. He told me he only goes to jerk off or get hand jobs and smiled at me, asking if I want him to give me something so I could spend my 5 minutes with him. I teased and said he‚Äôs fast, and he said yes very. I said no, because I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was against the rules, and offered to flash him from my car instead. I pulled out my tits and played with them for him as he unzipped his jeans and showed me his huge cock that was visibly pulsing without him working it. I smiled and played with my tits and put on a show for him through the window as he jerked his cock hard for me, letting me watch but being careful to hide from the people walking around by their cars. I jiggled and bounced them around and said I have to go, and he shook my hand and said his name was Alejandro and begged to know when I‚Äôd be back. I smiled and said it looks like Friday is my day :) I drove away wet and satisfied with how well-received and respected I was, and how incredibly attractive I felt. It felt great and was an amazing confidence boost. I have always wanted to be fucked in a mirrored room and love red light - I had a 10/10 time! Happy to answer any questions, one of the happiest days of my life	SluttyConfessions
Do you think binaural music could be the future?	I've been thinking a lot lately about the potential in binaural music. For example, if Dolby Atmos where to establish itself in the mainstream, how music producers could use this to create more interesting music. Here is an example of someone who produced a song with intention to mix it with Dolby Atmos (altough this is a binaural Re-render of the Atmos mix).	audiophile

VIP 14 or Books of Covenant to rush T5?	I'm a mid-tier spender (growth fund, monthy gem supply, recharge events, and a few daily chests).I just got VIP12 and I have the gems to go just to vip 13 (around 150k gems).I'm only spinning wheels 10 times , as I still don't know for sure my troop orientation and my target commanders, and that's why I wanted to focus on getting as many universal heads as I can.So my objective was always vip 14.But as a ch25, I just realised I will soon be out of buildings to upgrade for a long time if I don't upgrade my castle which is still level 18 ( I am missing around 163k gems worth of books) . the rate I acquire books is very low (I recently started doing forts as much as i can and get around 50 books per day, so I will need more than 320 days to gather all books for free).Plus I want the extra 7% research speed the level 25 academy will give me, as I still have a heap of research to do before T5, and more than a year of universal speedups (not enough for T5 still, but I am acquiring many speedups from alliance gifts every day, because I'm in a spenders' alliance). So I'm in a dilemma: 1. will I use a large amount of gems on books when my building comes to a halt, in order to win valuable research time and get sooner to T5? but on the same time, lose months of vip 14 (and thus a corresponding amount of gold heads), or 2. use it only on vip and just ramp up on forts. as a result, in the long run I would have a few hundreds gold heads more, but I would lose a lot of research time, and my building would be at a halt for months, and T5 would come many months or even more than a year later. My aim is to kick some asses in war, and for this I need both T5 AND expertised top tier legendaries. I know everyone thinks differently, so I'm not asking you what to do.I'm asking what would you do in my position.	RiseofKingdoms
Scotland - We are tenants and our garage roof has developed a heavy leak. Out landlady says that due to personal circumstances at the moment she cannot afford to have the leak repaired. Do we have any rights to ensure that this is repaired?	She has sent out an electrician to disconnect the light which is beside the leak but says that she cannot afford the repair work to see to the roof itself. We store things in the garage and my husband uses the space to store equipment and materials that he uses for his work, so we would lose income if any of it were damaged. Obviously we understand her position, these are tough times for everyone, but we're concerned about it getting worse and causing more substantial damage if it goes untreated. Do we have any rights to ensure that this is repaired? As it's just the garage I wasn't sure if the same rules applied to if it were in the house itself. We're in Scotland, should that make a difference. Can anyone offer any advice?	LegalAdviceUK
For some weapons, pre-Shadowkeep helmets and class items allow you to stack 3 reserve mods	Hello, As I couldn't find any information for this, I wanted to share it. So basically, pre-Shadowkeep helmets and class items with an ammo reserves perk sometimes allow you to stack a third reserve mod, in addition to the two mods on a 2.0 chest piece. This results in a sometime not negligible increase of total damages, and potentially a greater benefit from scavenger perks. Here are the datas I gathered so far : &#x200B; |Weapon|Default total ammos reserve|w/ 1 reserve mod|w/ 2 reserve mods|w/ 3 reserve mods|Total damages increase from 2 to 3 mods| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Sleeper Simulant**|9|10|11|**12**|\+9,1%| |**Sleeper Simulant w/ catalyst**|11|12|13|**14**|\+7,7%| |**Xenophage**|28|32|34|***no benefit***|\-| |**Whisper of the Worm**|18|21|23|**24**|\+4,3%| |**Heir Apparent**|500|520|540|**560**|\+3,7%| |**J√∂tunn**|17|20|22|**25**|\+13,6%| |**The Mountaintop**|19|21|23|**25**|\+8,7%| |**Wendigo**|17|19|21|**23**|\+9,5%| |**Interference VI w/ Field prep**|18|20|22|**24**|\+9,1%| &#x200B; Feel free to share and complete those datas.	destiny2

Succesful Nebido story	Currently in the last few days of my third 1.000mg testosterone undecenoate (Nebido) shot. The protocol that my doctor has prescribed me is a 1.000mg shot every 7 weeks. That is around 142 mg of testosterone every week. Before I have used Androgel with no succes. Just a slight increase in libido but no morning wood. Fatigue was still present. The reason i started TRT in the first place is because of low libido, no morning erections, social anxiety, concentration issues (i was diagnosed with ADHD when i was 8 years old). Currently testing wether i have Klinefelters syndrome or not. Nebido works truly amazing for me. You have to be patient with it because the first shot did little to nothing for me. But right when i took the second shot i experienced the benefits for around 2/3 weeks. Now I am on my third shot and I experienced the benefits for almost fully 6 weeks. I experienced these benefits from TRT: \- I lost some bodyfat, but that is also from being in a caloric deficit. \- All my fatigue problems are gone! I dont need a nap anymore around 4 pm. That changed my lifestyle a lot! \- Everyday morning wood. Every. Day. \- Very high libido. I get horny around 4-5 times a day. \- Harder erections. My girlfriend also told me that my penis appears bigger when erect. \- Some increase in beard growth. The hair on my cheeks is also thicker. I know people have bad experiences with Nebido. That is because the standard protocol of 12 weeks. The optimal protocol for most people is around 6-7-8 weeks, though i dont recommed the 6 weeks protocol. It builds up a lot of testosterone on the long run -> long term problems. Feel free to ask my any questions regarding my TRT experience! I live in The Netherlands by the way so Sustanon, Androgel & Nebido are my only options.	Testosterone

Notable box office bombs barely anyone heard of.	We all know films that are famous because of how little money they made. But there are also notable bombs that are so unknown that barely anyone discusses on this sub. For example, have you ever heard of 2008 animated movie Delgo? With its stellar cast, cliched, unoriginal plot and ugly animation this reminded few months ago by u/Saberspark on YouTube junk monstrosity failed to gross even one million dollar out of budget around forty and broke record for the worst opening ever in 2000+ theatres, only to be beaten four year later by Oogieloves...

Computer Goes to Black Screen When Trying to Install Windows 10 On New SSD	Specs: About a month ago my computer started randomly shutting down. I'd be in the middle of playing a game (didn't matter what games) and then the PC would chug pretty bad for a five or ten seconds before restarting itself. I thought it might be a heat issue but it would usually work just fine after the reboot, and while the problem was progressing (would reboot more than once before stabilizing) I never saw the temperatures go to critical levels, meaning never more than low/mid 80s. Something to note is that we got kittens right before this happened. Twice they shut down my PC while it was running, once by pushing the power button and once by stepping on the power switch on the power strip. I decided a repair or reinstall of Windows 10 might help. In trying to do a repair I would get an error saying that Windows couldn't successfully repair itself. I tried going through Windows Boot Manager and would get an error -- 0xc00000f. I found out that this relates to the Boot Configuration Data store in Windows. Trying the reinstall failed so I couldn't repair the BCD, so I thought maybe my hard drive was screwed. Ah well, I'll buy a new one. Now I've installed the new SSD and when I am trying to boot from the Windows 10 USB key that I purchased when I first put the PC together, the computer just goes to a black screen and my monitor's LED indicator goes out. I can boot into the BIOS just fine, and it recognizes the USB key as a UEFI Windows 10 USB Partition. But then when i choose to boot using the key to the black screen I go. In doing some research people were suggesting that I pare down the issue by removing peripherals. So I took out all my other hard drives, took out my GPU, took out my second stick of RAM, unplugged everything but the mouse and keyboard, but I'm still having this issue. My gut it telling me that it's the motherboard at this point. But before I buy a new mobo and rebuild the PC I wanted to reach out here in case anyone had some additional troubleshooting tips or experience that might be beneficial. Specs: * Windows 10 Home * MSI Z270 SLI * i5 7600k (overclocked to 4.2 ghz when I built it back in 2017 and never had issues) * NVidia 1070 GTX Duke (not overclocked) * 16 GB DDR4 3000mhz RAM * Samsung 860 1TB SSD	techsupport
The stress!	I really don‚Äôt want to discourage anyone reading this. I‚Äôm not a great representative of 3 months sober. Man I think I‚Äôm loosing it. I‚Äôm so unhappy in my relationship. He‚Äôs a perfect husband. He does everything right. I just don‚Äôt think we work anymore. And we are sad all the time. And when I leave work I‚Äôm stressed coming home. Which im not asking for advice on. I know where all that will lead. What is really the worst is coming home and being mad and watching me suck the happiness out of his night. And then having relapse dreams. And all I want is to drink. I don‚Äôt know how to stay sober when I‚Äôm so unhappy in life. I know everyone is going to stay staying sober will help me deal with the problems in front of me. Or wait for the miracle. Or I don‚Äôt know. I love the cliches. They usually help me. But man I‚Äôm just angry. And I don‚Äôt want to speak with my sponsor. I don‚Äôt want to do this. I want to want to do this. I‚Äôm just tired. And I‚Äôm trying to push through. I‚Äôm going to go hiking today. I‚Äôve been keeping distance from family that‚Äôs triggering. But I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep this up. Thanks for listening. I know I need to meditate and read a book and try and live in the moment and AH. I‚Äôve never been a happy go lucky person. Cue in alcoholism lol Ok that‚Äôs all. I appreciate you guys being here.

[TOMT] [Movie] [Early to mid 2000s] A weird movie I watched about a crackhead driving around in a car...	I rented this movie from the video store in the early to mid 2000s with some friends. If I remember correctly, it was a black skinny dude driving around in a car filming himself with a handycam, most of it was him trying to get crack cocaine... it was very odd. I don‚Äôt know if the guy was a crackhead in real life or just playing one. None of my friends remember it... Anyone have any idea what I‚Äôm talking about? Thank you	tipofmytongue

[MITB Spoilers] The difference between the men's and women's entrances in the main event	The men strolled into the gym all talking mad shit to each other while braced for a fight. It felt natural or as natural as a bunch of wrestlers fighting in a corporate building can feel. But the women sashay their way into the lobby, do their signature poses and form a quiet orderly line before Asuka does some wacky antics. It felt weird.	SquaredCircle

Entitled Mother thinks her kid is entitled to go outside despite COVID-19	Hey everyone, and possibly Redditor ;). Long time dweller, first time poster. For context, EM: Entitled Mother (duh), P1 - Police Officer 1, P2 - Police Officer 2, C - Cadet. As you all know with the current situation with COVID-19, the lockdown in the UK has forced everyone to stay home. While this rule applies to everyone, the EM doesn't think it applies to her. It was a normal day, and I was completing some police cadet work (I'm a senior police cadet) when I receive an email from my trainer. The email read something along the lines of: volunteering to help patrol my area for people breaking the lockdown rules. Of course this would be a never again experience so I accepted! A week later, I had met at my local police station, along with another cadet (of course with PPE, e.g. face masks and social distancing). Eventually we headed out. While there were a few people about, we had told them to disperse back, and sure enough everyone listening and no-one questioned me and headed home immediately. I was having an amazing time, and felt proud of helping the country stay safe from this calamity that fell upon us. I thought the rest of the day will go well. &#x200B; BOY, was I wrong &#x200B; At \[insert park name here\] was an Entitled Mother and her Nice Kid. As usual, we told her to pack up and leave. Nothing wrong about that right? Wrong. The entitled mother *stood up and looked at P1 straight in the face* Here's how the conversation entailed: &#x200B; **Me**: Ma'am please leave this area and head home immediately. **EM**: *stands up and faces P1* **EM**: My kid is dyyyying at home, he needs to be out! **P1**: Ma'am this is not a valid reason to be out, head home or we will be forced to arrest or fine you. **EM**: Yes it is what do you know you're not an NHS worker, you're only a police officer! *At this point the EM is standing horrendously close to the officers at this point* **P2**: Step away from him now. **Me**: Ma'am step away from him, you must observe social distancing don't you understand that? **EM**: You're just kids what do you know you f\*\*\*\* c\*\*\*. **P2**: He is saying to step away from P1, so do so now, and NEVER swear at my cadets. *My fellow cadet gets involved* **C**: Ma'am unless you WANT to be prosecuted, head home now. **P2**: I will be forced to arrest you if you do not move. *All hell breaks loose after the Entitled Mother assaults P2* **EM**: That's what you get for implying i have the coronavirus! *Keep in mind that we did not say that at all* &#x200B; I get annoyed quickly, but then she PUSHES the other cadet and P1 to the point they fall on the floor. This is when my insticts kick in and I pepper spray here and detained her while some people exercising calls the police. While this is happening, I get kicked in the hand and my god, did that hurt. &#x200B; Her NK finally speaks up, around the same time backup arrives. **NK**: MUM WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DO THIS, YOU ALWAYS MAKE A SCENE AND PUSH ANYONE THAT TELLS YOU TO DO SOMETHING *This shocks us all* Upon looking at her history, she had been arrested before for charges of assault. Eventually, she gets taken away in a police van, while the kid's dad was called to pick him up. Meanwhile the kid was apologising profusely for his acts. We tell him it's not your fault. He smiles and leaves. &#x200B; PS: I broke 2 of my fingers while this happened, look below to see proof. &#x200B; I hope this gets on Redditor's video, but thanks for reading! https://preview.redd.it/mrolsc3o55y41.jpg?width=267&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=261b5f3014ade362ac2a92a27e178fe6c8f74ef8	redditoryt

Can‚Äôt stop thinking about the past	Some days I just CAN‚ÄôT stop thinking about all of the things I did wrong when I lost all of my friends when I was 17 (senior year of high school). I‚Äôm going into my third year of college now, it‚Äôs ridiculous. I keep thinking about how it was probably all my fault because of my immaturity back then. I think it‚Äôs hard for me to accept the fact that I was in a fragile emotional state and just immature. Basically, one of my friends had a crush on me and I didn‚Äôt like him at the time that he wanted me to like him. When he got over it, he stopped being a friend to me and just started acting cruel. I thought he was just a nice person, but it seemed like he was only when he liked me. When I stood up for myself and told him I was tired of the way he had been treating me, he got angry and cut me off. After that, all of my friends left me my senior year, and the guy told everyone I was obsessed with him. My friends left me for that reason and were tired of it. I tried telling them it‚Äôs not an obsession because it was an actually abusive situation, but maybe I was wrong. They took his side, and I was seen as the girl who was obsessed with him. I was really hurt by his mind games and one day being nice to me, and the next day cutting me off and leaving me hanging. This guy got me kicked out of class groups and humiliated me in minute ways throughout my senior year. I was alone. I was overly emotional. I spent my senior year always crying and going to the school psychologist because I felt like I was crazy. Some of my friends that left me seemed to think I deserved it because I ‚Äúled him on,‚Äù or just said nothing. That‚Äôs what I feel terrible for. I couldn‚Äôt make any move with him because one day he was nice, the next he wasn‚Äôt. Nothing was consistent. But now I think back and I feel so guilty, like all of this was my fault. When this guy was being cruel to me throughout our friendship for the first time, I even went through my other friend‚Äôs phone to look at the conversations with him to see if he even cared about me. Now I realize that was so immature to go through my friend‚Äôs phone conversations with him, but I needed validation at the time that maybe he did care about me. My friends would try to comfort me the first time around of him being cruel, but would never outright defend me. I felt like I had nobody on my side, so at the time even searching for validation through their phone conversations when he was being cruel was oddly the way to do it. I feel so stupid. I can‚Äôt seem to get over my mistakes of the past. Who loses all of their friends like that if there isn‚Äôt something wrong with them? I had people-pleasing behavior, I wanted to keep this guy as my friend instead of being forced to go into a relationship with him, but I guess I couldn‚Äôt just be friends with him. But I tried. I don‚Äôt know. If anyone read through my ramblings, thank you so much. I just beat myself up over losing my friends my senior year of high school sometimes. It makes me feel like an imposter whenever I make new friends, like they don‚Äôt know the real me, the one who lost all of their friends before. It makes me feel like I don‚Äôt deserve friends.	Vent

I touched my toes for the first time in my life.	It‚Äôs a small thing I just wanted to share because I feel like I‚Äôm a little overly excited about this. I‚Äôve teetered between slightly and fairly out of shape my whole life (nothing crazy this isn‚Äôt a complete body transformation post.) BUT I remember in middle school all the ‚Äúcool,‚Äù athletic kids could touch their toes in gym class. I never could. As I found activities and sports I enjoyed such as snowboarding and hiking (turns out team sports suck and I‚Äôd rather be my own competition.) I would be healthy when I was motivated to do these things, but still generally out of shape. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to last long on the slopes and more difficult hikes would take a lot out of me. I found yoga in high school. I liked it because it wasn‚Äôt about bulking up or being a tough body builder, it was about using your body to it‚Äôs fullest potential. However I had a hard time sticking with it. Flash forward a few years, with all this free time I got back into it! Long story short I (M21) can finally touch my toes for the first time in my life without bending my knees!!! TLDR Never been able to touch my toes. Touched my toes without bending my knees today.

I'm done with this game until the next patch	i have had 0 fun playing this horrible game and hope everyone sobers up from the newness soon and notices how horrible this game is absolutely absymal deck variance, abysmal difference between games, pathetic amount of decks that can consistently win, pathetic experience for a card game overall. mark my words until a major patch is released the amount of competitive decks will shrink daily and this sub will go from happy to nothing but rage in a months time without major changes. I hope riot can make this game worth playing but for now there is nothing that makes this game fun aside from the fact its new.	LegendsOfRuneterra

A love letter to the HP 6200 Pro (SFF)	Over the past year I've been experimenting with my home setup, including running a Dell R710. However, my favourite piece of hardware on my network by a wide margin is my HP 6200 Pro (sff). These seem to have been in wide circulation in colleges and universities, and there are a ton of them out there. Mine came with an i3 and 4GB of RAM, and I bumped it fairly cheaply to an i5 and 8GB, and I've been pretty thrilled with the performance considering the price. In Canada we have significantly less choice and we pay significantly more (for example, you frequently see the R710 for sale in the US around $100 USD, the cheapest you can find it here is around $250 CAD, and you still might have to purchase caddies). But the 6200 Pro cost me $75 CAD, it holds 3 drives easily (assuming you're willing to swap out the optical drive) and it's cheap and quiet. If you can live without the redundancy provided by enterprise grade hardware, I'd recommend these boxes wholeheartedly!	homelab

How do I stop being clingy during quarantine	So hopefully I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing this but it has recently dawned upon me how needy and clingy I have become during quarantine. I realised this when my sister pointed out how I was checking my phone like every 5-10 minutes (I was checking for replies back to texts) and it sucks cause I‚Äôm not always like this but now I‚Äôm forced inside and can‚Äôt go out and socialise its kind of driving me nuts how I have no one to talk to I‚Äôve tried learning new skills and done a lot of yard work to keep my mind occupied but it still does not distract me from checking my phone or trying to talk to people . Between having to revise for exams and being locked up in here my neediness starts to show when I‚Äôm texting people back almost instantly when they take hours to get to me (which again isn‚Äôt something I normally do) and it‚Äôs putting people off from talking to me Is there anything else I can do to stop being so needy and stop looking for validation from others when they text me , help	socialskills
Question about Metro Exodus and the Metro series.	I recently downloaded Metro Exodus as its part of the Xbox games pass PC, and before playing I attempted to watch some recaps, but most were around 20 minutes long and weren‚Äôt particularly compelling, so I didn‚Äôt finish any. I got about an hour into Exodus, and while it‚Äôs interesting and fun so far, I am wondering if the game will be significantly better if I take the time to either watch long recaps or if I just replay the first two games? Or maybe someone who has a good understanding of the story could give me a short recap? If possible I would like to just continue Exodus if it‚Äôs still enjoyable with or without understanding the rest of the story completely. Thanks!	gaming

I'm curious to know what the lineup for Primavera Sound Los Angeles would have looked like.	It's the middle of May, and I doubt they will announce a lineup, but if they did, they'd likely have done so around this time, right? The mayor of Los Angeles has been vocal about not having any concerts or festivals for the remainder of the year as well, and anyone thinking rationally will have already come to the conclusion this festival isn't happening. My questions are: * I wonder what the lineup would have looked like? * Will they bother announcing the lineup before cancelling it? * How long will it be until they officially make the announcement that it is cancelled?	primaverasound
How one character contributed to Shaun realizing that Lea makes him more	When Shaun held his monologue in 3.19 ‚ÄúHurt‚Äù of how he loves Lea because she makes him more than a *good doctor*, I wondered for some time how he came to this conclusion. So, I went back to the dialogues of past episodes and found two distinct conversations with a series regular that seem to build to the idea of the loved one making you more (besides the patients of the week, that also had their fair share in this). >2.13 ‚ÄúXin‚Äù: **Your life is better with her. You're a better person with her. Y-You need her. That's what love is.** > >3.17 ‚ÄúFixation‚Äù: **Lea's right. She is needy and selfish. Find someone who loves you the way you are.** ‚Äì People always say that, but shouldn't we be with someone who makes us a better version of ourselves? ‚Äì **Maybe. But trying not to be autistic won't make you better.** Guess which character said this? It was Morgan *twisted biatch* Reznick! Did I miss other relevant lines by other regular characters or has had Morgan more good influence on Shaun than we ever dared to believe‚Ä¶ ? ;)	thegooddoctor

What do you wish you knew when training to become a trader	Hi all, After about a year in back office I got promoted to a front office role at a trading firm, working directly for 2 traders. I'm starting off on developing hedging strategies, managing PnL, and providing market updates, which I think is a solid starting point for the path to becoming a commodity trader. (Would you agree?) I'm wondering what anyone further down the path would recommend I keep in mind as I start out. My line of thinking: * **Learning Process:** I would like a smooth and consistent ride up the learning curve as much as possible, so I am trying to identify key learning objectives: * Knowing how to analyze a market (market mechanisms, trends/events, S&D, pricing) * Managing a book (PnL, hedging) * Structuring deals * Actually executing trades * *What else?* * **Trading:** Once junior trader status, it seems the key concept is to pick a single market to focus on, develop and practice strategies to build confidence, and then evolve into greater complexity. **Background info:** Having just turned 29, seems I am getting into front office on the later side. But I bring something unique to the table because I started my career off as an env. engineer at power plants. So it was quite the process to get to this point. I expected I'd end up working for a project developer but the opportunity at this trading firm was the most promising opportunity during my career change. If the potential opportunity to become a trader is there, why not take it? They're hard to come by. Also, I am bullish long-term environmental trends, such as oil majors going net zero by 2050.

Beleggen voor neefjes / nichtjes	Beste allemaal, Aangezien er zich enorm veel wijsheid op dit forum bevindt, wil ik graag de volgende vraag stellen. Ik ben woonachtig en belastingplichtig in China. Dat zal waarschijnlijk veranderen in de toekomst, maar ik zie mijzelf voorlopig niet terugkeren naar NL. Mijn zus heeft drie kinderen. Ze is sinds kort gescheiden en heeft het financieel niet gemakkelijk. Ik wil graag voor haar kinderen een rekening openen en daar iedere maand geld op storten (ongeveer 180-240 euro). Ik was aan het denken om ieder kind iedere maand een ETF (bijv. VWRL o.i.d.) te kopen en dit uit te keren wanneer de middelste 18 jaar wordt, wat ongeveer in 2027 zal zijn. Iemand enig idee waar ik dit het beste kan doen? Ik zit zelf bij De Giro, maar ik weet niet of er misschien andere en betere alternatieven zijn. Bij voorbaat dank!	DutchFIRE

"is it a bad idea to write barnard's ""pick a woman from history"" supplement about britney spears?"	"well, the title says it all. the prompt is to ""pick a woman from history or fiction that \[i'd\] like to have a one hour conversation with."" i'm most likely EDing barnard as an international applicant with ok/average stats and good ECs. britney has always been a woman i've looked up to, and how she never stopped fighting for herself and her kids as a woman that lived through some serious shit (music industry messing her up, her public meltdown, addiction, her conservatorship, etc.) always inspired me. i think i can write a pretty solid, self-reflective and humorous essay about her and how she inspired me throughout my life without glorifying and fangirling over her. i assume the AOs are tired of reading about marie curie and rosa luxemburg anyway. on the other hand, i'm afraid my choice would be seen as 'too shallow' or not academic enough, especially considering how britney's public image has been suffering for the past few years. overall, i'm just wondering if it's all worth the risk. i'd be glad if you could help me out :)"	ApplyingToCollege

"flight operated by ""X"" airline: which company buy from?"	Hello! I'm looking to buy a ticket from MAD-DFW. It's direct, so that seems to give me some sense of security. I've been able to find the flight through several different airlines (American, Finnair, and Iberia), yet all make a note that they are being operated by American airlines. Prices are similar for all of the flights. So I'm wondering who I should buy from? If it does get cancelled, would it be more safe to have bought the ticket through the American? Also, what does this mean when one company is operating all of the flights? thank you!	Flights

kicking a roommate out	first year of college, i had THE shittiest roommate. i mean, she was a pathological liar, she would never clean, steal from me, leave her used tissues on my desk, and left menstrual blood stains on our walls, and the stories are endless. she eventually moved out of our room and onto the floor below me before christmas break because of my passive-aggressiveness. cut to the end of the school year, my friend who lived across the hall and i were extremely close, and decided we were gonna move off campus into a two bed apartment for the next school year. then three other girls approached us looking for a house to split, and we figured ‚Äòwhy not‚Äô, since it‚Äôd be cheaper than splitting a two bedroom. one of the girls was actually the one who took in my old roommate, and i hardly knew her aside from group interactions. eventually, us five move in together and the girl who took in my old roommate, let‚Äôs call her ‚Äòchelsea‚Äô, was just trash to live with. she would hoard dishes and silverware and would half-ass washing dishes. it wasn‚Äôt so noticeable because there were five of us so we couldn‚Äôt pinpoint who it was. so, one of our roommates leave, and we decide to move into a four bedroom for our third year, so we can have parking and move away from the immediate city. cut to now, three full years living with chelsea. our new place is bright, spacious, and we tend to keep it clean. chelsea is hoarding dishes, not cleaning up after herself, leaving things greasy and nasty, and is just inconsiderate as fuck.. my best friend and i aren‚Äôt ready to graduate so we‚Äôll be staying an extra year, meanwhile we do not know what her plans are, although she said she‚Äôd be moving out in july. we have new tenants coming in that we picked in march. now, chelsea is telling us she wants to stay, that it would be easier for us to live with someone we‚Äôre ‚Äòcomfortable‚Äô with, but she literally sucks and i honestly want to but don‚Äôt have the heart to say ‚ÄúYOU CAN‚ÄôT LIVE WITH US‚Äù any advice? üò≠ *edit: our lease with her ended in april, but she‚Äôs subletting for my best friend who went home for the summer, so she‚Äôs not on the current lease, but i guess she feels entitled since she‚Äôs already been living here and she‚Äôs too lazy to look for a new place but we REALLY don‚Äôt want to live with her again.	badroommates

My mom's boss wants her to work for free	"Hi all! My mom is a dental hygienist working in The Woodlands, Texas. She only works around 32 hours a week (Monday - Thursday), so not a full time position. Her dental office has been closed to due COVID, but they're re-opening this week. Her boss (the dentist) wants all workers to come in for this week (5/11 - 5/15) as ""volunteers"" that will not be paid. This is because they have lost money during COVID and are trying to recuperate losses. All patients seen during this week will still be paying, and the owner will still be collecting money - she just won't be paying any of her workers. The dentist did say this was ""optional"" to participate, but everyone is going in anyways in fear of repercussions of losing their jobs/retaliation. I've been trying to review Department of Labor laws and FLSA, but I'm lost in the legal jargon. Is this a case where this dental office can be reported? This seems to me to be completely illegal and immoral to me. I want to advocate for my mom, and I know she's just afraid of losing her job if she sticks up for herself and her coworkers. Any advice would be helpful!"	legaladvice

[Uni] NTU Financial Aid	Sorry for sounding ignorant but I‚Äôm genuinely confused. So if I did not misunderstand NTU‚Äôs instructions, we are supposed to apply for study loans/bursaries during the course application period, but we only have to submit supporting documents within 2 weeks of acceptance of offer. I do recall applying for it, but I did not receive any emails to indicate that I have successfully applied for it. Sorry for being paranoid, but I‚Äôm quite afraid that there might be some technical issues that resulting in my application not going through, because I kept receiving error messages when I try to navigate through NTU‚Äôs website and application portal so I did refresh my webpages quite a bit. The last thing I want would be to accept NTU‚Äôs offer and then realise that my application for study loans/bursaries was not received. So, is there a way to check if I successfully submitted my application? Or can I still apply after accepting the offer?	SGExams

It was like walking backwards at the start screen and jumping into an awesome level that was always within reach but never obvious.	LSD

Great apps for Mirroring for Android	&#x200B; I just thought of sharing since I found it useful. I am the type of user that explores a lot of things. I download apps more often to see how can I mirror my phone to a much wider screen Well lately I found out some apps that you can consider using to do so. By the way, I watch movies and play games available on mobile devices on my TV and PC. Here is the list. 1. ApowerMirror ApowerMirror is a desktop app that works across all platform devices. This includes PC, TV and of course mobile devices. What's more with the app? It can record the screen activity while you are mirroring, annotate, and even capture your screen. Also, it has the capability to control your mobile device on your PC. The only thing that won't be transferred on your PC is the sound. 2. Screen Mirror The next tool is a free web-based app. You can access this anywhere. You just have to have a browser compatible with it and scan the Qr code. That being said, you need your phone and your PC connected under the same Wi-fi network. 3. Wireless Projection (Built-in) Many Android users probably see the benefit of having a Huawei Device. The wireless projection feature along with the Huawei Share feature allows you to connect your TV and your phone without connecting to a Wi-Fi server. How do I know? I use it my self. Am I bluffing? Of course not! It is one of the great features Huawei has. However, Huawei share is only available on the latest software version.	androidapps

Threatening Jury Votes Strategy	"This is a strategy I've wondered about while rewatching RI and other seasons and I don't know of it's even allowed. After the merge in RI, Ometepe is up 7-5 and vote out one of their own. Now 6-5, Zapatera works like crazy to try and get one of them to open up their eyes and see that they are brainwashed robots. Alas, they don't and the get Pagonged. My idea for a strategy is this: After the first Zapatera member gets picked off and the numbers are 6-4, they see the writing on the wall and are pretty much sitting ducks. They know Rob is completely in control and brainwashed his fellow 5 Ometepe members. What if they go up to Rob and say, ""We know you're in control, if you don't take put a few Ometepe people before you tale all of us out, the 4 of us will vote against you at FTC."" Let's just say it's not a bluff and they will follow through with it. That would force Rob to do something, because if someone is definitely getting 4 votes at FTC, then all they need is 1 more and hes screwed. I've only seem s1-22 and s38-40. Has this strategy ever been used or thought of? Is it allowed? What are your thoughts?"	survivor

Building a PC for streaming console content	Hi recently a friend asked me for some help in regards of streaming. Because of the quarantine he aparently got money to spare an decided to splurge on streaming equipment. He got: a Streamdeck an elgato capture card (which states it needs a NVidia 10xx) usb-mic and -headset the problem now is he only got an old pc from work so no USB 3 which both the streamdeck and the capture card state the need of. Also in the Programm of the capture card states that his Radeon HD6450 is currently used or has an insufficient driver. Now since he is on the roll he decided to buy or assemble a new PC. He alloted around 1000‚Ç¨ for that since he won't need it for anything else except maybe some excel an browsing. Since i am a full on PC-Gamer i have no clue what kinda Hardware he needs to stay in the loop for a bit. My first step would have been the GPU since its the only thing i know at least a minimum and i would have recommended a GTX 16xx since the capture card doesn't specify an AMD alternative. Any help would be much appreciated. Also this is my first post on reddit so be kind guys.	buildapc

Cutom QMK macropad with encoder	Hi everyone, I have used the search function, but I couldn't find a comprehensive guide on the matter. I would like to start dipping my toes in the QMK world by making a custom macropad. The first problem that I encountered is that there is some documentation for setting up qmk for a standard macro pad, but I coulnd't find much about the implementation of a rotary encoder. I mean, I see some people have done something, but I couldn't understand the process. Another thing I cannot wrap my head around is how I start from a custom layout on the qmk configurator. Layout that I have created on the online keyboard layout editor for example. I would like to start from a layout not included in the options because in the future I might use this for a custom keyboard and would like to explore the worst case right now even if not strictly necessary. Also, how should I wire the enconder into the switch matrix?	olkb

The Joysü§òüèΩ and SetbacksüëéüèΩ with Having a Desi Roommate	"Happy Mother's Day, I was recently in the apartment market, looking to share an apartment with a responsible person. I met a really cool white guy, and we clicked, but he could only give me a commitment in 2 days. Two days later, he told me that out of the blue, his college friend wanted to move in with them, and this potential white roommate guy was going to pass on me becoming his roommate. So I found ""Kumar"" on FB. He was a very socially awkward guy whom I suspected of being on the spectrum. My GF disagrees, but one thing that we both agree on is that he's a wimp who NEVER takes the initiative to do anything positive. This got me thinking to the many times I've had roommates - many of them Desis. Here are some Setbacks that I've noticed; * They never take initiative * They're typically dirtier * When you pay for one roommate, you may often times get 2 more when they bring in a college buddy or co-worker, or parents (happened to me when one loser dude brought his damn parents to stay with us for weeks), or even 10,000 roommates, in the case of bedbugs from Mumbai. * Indians **never** buy furniture, plants, utensils, or other shareable things. Instead, they'll use your things, and degrade it, whether it's your furniture, your TV, your utensils, your baker's mitt, etc. * Indians cook pungent items that require always leaving the windows open. I had this one stupid guy who, while cooking some pungent foods and sauteeing red chili peppers that smelt like tear gas, left the main entrance opened so that the smells could diffuse **into the main hallway for the other neighbors.** * Indians can do very embarrassing things. I had a roommate who never slept in his own room. He was a fresh-off-the-~~bullock cart~~boat guy from Hyderabad who'd sleep on the floor in the living room with a thin sheet over him. He'd sleep sideways, so you could see his profile from afar. Anyways, I was dating this girl, and when we walked in to my apartment, she laughed hysterically at this site. Man, I was so embarrassed. Another roommate from Meerut was peddling some Amway pyramid scheme to my friends. * In college, I had a whole house rented out. I brought in this Marathi guy from Pune. After a few weeks, he brought in this other Marathi guy also from Pune. These guys would talk in Marathi around me, and I felt like they were ganging up on me. The second Marathi guy even asked my ex-girlfriend (who was an ABCD) out the week after we had broken up. She was, of course, playing us against each other. Now, the perks: * **They've given me a chance over and over again to be my roommate. No matter how many complaints that I have, no white dudes want to be my roommate.** * They're career-focused and a good inspiration about pursuing material goals. Thanks Desi guys for being sojourners with me."	ABCDesis

I usually get a iced green tea or chai latte with coconut milk. I'm not sure if this is appropriate but if anyone has an idea or some other drinks they order while pregnant please let me know!

Just hit a yeet	"So there was this one random old woman who came up to me and she was obviously grumpy. She said ""hey what are you listening to. Probably some kind of rap. I want to hear how bad it is. Show the world!"" BTW I only listen to classical music So I was like ""ok"" and I showed her that I was listening to Tchaikovsky Romeo and Juliet overture. She was then like ""gimme that"" so she grabbed my phone out of my hand and started searching for any rap songs. Did she find any? Nope. She then threw the phone on the floor and spat at me and walked away mumbling to herself. &#x200B; I still don't know how to react."	teenagers
I had an idea to solve the repetitive dialogue options when catching bugs/fish/clams	"If you're familiar with playing any game from the Zelda franchise, you probably know that you get a small dialogue from the first time you collect a rupee the first time you load into your save file. So, for the uninitiated, if you load into your file and collect a red rupee, it will say something like ""You collected 20 rupees, don't spend it all in one place!"" Then every time you collect one after that, it's automatically added to your wallet without the dialogue pop-up. I think this could apply pretty well to animal crossing. Say you load into your file and catch a sea bass, you would get the dialogue as usual. Then, every sea bass you catch afterwards would be automatically added after the animation of catching it. This would reset so that every time you open your game, you get a dialogue pop-up on your first catch and not again until the next time you open animal crossing. I feel it would save some time for players who've seen the prompts multiple times."	AnimalCrossing

2020 NFL Draft Review - Analysis and Career Predictions for Each Team's Draft Class - NFC West	We roll on with a division-by-division rundown of the 2020 NFL Draft with arguably the best division in football, the NFC West. Catch up on the other installments of this [2020 NFL Draft review series](https://www.rotoballer.com/tag/2020-nfl-draft-review-series-for-fantasy-football) with the [AFC South](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-afc-south/736898), [NFC South](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-nfc-south/736460), [AFC East](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-afc-east/736202), [NFC East](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-nfc-east/735919), [AFC North](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-afc-north/735564?src=cat_feat_9954), and [NFC North](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-nfc-north/734932). Every year after the draft, I write a [way-too-long review of each team‚Äôs draft](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/blb7sw/gpngcs_2019_nfl_draft_review_analysis_and_career/). The purpose of this draft review is to give predictions for the careers of each team‚Äôs drafted players. I‚Äôve watched film of each player I‚Äôm commenting on. Draft grades are overly optimistic and unrealistic. Unlike the majority of post-draft coverage out there, I will pick busts. Keep in mind that [23.4% of all first-round picks bust](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4grt3c/did_the_rams_and_eagles_give_up_too_much_to_move/). Let me preface this by saying: predicting the career of an NFL draft pick is a ridiculous exercise. There is so much unknown that goes into whether a player succeeds or fails at the next level. I can make educated guesses based on team situation, supporting cast, and research about the prospect‚Äôs character and work ethic, but there‚Äôs a reason teams make so many mistakes every year. You simply don‚Äôt know for sure how a player will react to being a pro. Injuries are also a huge factor in the fate of a player and impossible to predict accurately. Nevertheless, this is a fun exercise and gives us a chance to review how each team approached the draft. ## Overview Before we start, here are some of my general thoughts on the 2020 NFL Draft. Quickly on the broadcast - they did a great job given the circumstances. The production quality was great and they did more actual analysis than usual. My main gripe with draft coverage every year is that they don‚Äôt show incredible highlights (they somehow didn‚Äôt show [the Aaron Dobson catch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCdFFFAxLz0) in 2013). This year, they showed more footage of actual football and I appreciated that. The only two negatives for me were the constant tragic stories and Booger McFarland. Oh, and if any poor soul bet on [Justin Jefferson](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21685/Justin+Jefferson) Under 21.5 draft position, ESPN should apologize to you. They showed him on the phone celebrating right before cutting to Goodell announcing the 21st pick - [Jalen Reagor](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21686/Jalen+Reagor) to the Eagles. Jefferson was of course on the phone with the Vikings, who took him at 22. Brutal beat. As for the draft, remember [this tweet about mock drafts being ‚Äúwronger‚Äù than ever](https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1251100172228218880)? Funny, this was probably the chalkiest first-round ever in the internet age. Nothing was truly shocking to me, including the Packers trading up for [Jordan Love](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21841/Jordan+Love) (more on that [here](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-nfc-north/734932)). I had Damon Arnette in the first round in [my first mock draft this draft season](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-mock-draft-1-0/731349?src=). I wrote an [article lauding Jordyn Brooks as an undervalued commodity](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184?src=cat_feat_9954). Noah Ibinoghene going in the first was surprising, I suppose. But there was no Clelin Ferrell at No. 4 or Tyson Alualu at No. 10. It speaks to how the media and internet scouts might be catching up to, or God forbid actually influencing the teams. So here is the next installment of my annual draft review. Each player will receive their career prediction in parentheses following their name. For example: [Joe Burrow](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21693/Joe+Burrow) (5). Here's how the picks break down: **5 ‚Äì All-Pro:** Starter who has performed at an elite level at his position. **4 ‚Äì Above-Average:** Starter who has been among the best at his position. **3 ‚Äì Solid:** Starter or valuable back-up with significant positive production. **2 ‚Äì Replacement Level:** Below-average starter or back-up who made minor contributions. **1 ‚Äì Bust:** Player who didn‚Äôt amount to anything positive. Next up, the NFC West. ## Arizona Cardinals The Cardinals dealt their second-round pick for one of the best receivers in football in [DeAndre Hopkins](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/14986/DeAndre+Hopkins). When you add that acquisition into their draft haul, it‚Äôs one of the most impressive in the entire NFL. At No. 8, the Cardinals went best player available with Isaiah Simmons (4) from Clemson. There were some [rumors that Simmons would fall a bit on draft day](https://www.rotoballer.com/player-news/isaiah-simmons-could-fall-in-round-1/733665) due to teams not knowing what to do with him. Simmons is a quality football player, but not knowing what position room to put him in is somewhat of an issue. He‚Äôs not big enough to bang in the box every down and he‚Äôs not as fluid in coverage as the best free safeties. He made a lot of plays blitzing from depth and taking advantage of his absurd size-athleticism mix at the college level. Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables is an extraordinary defensive mind and played him all over the field at every position except defensive tackle. In Arizona I expect Simmons to line up mostly at the second level, doing most of his damage in coverage against tight ends and blitzing. Fitting him in might not be so easy after adding De'Vondre Campbell and Jordan Hicks as off-ball linebackers. I‚Äôll let Vance Joseph figure it out. Simmons can fly and make plays so it will be hard to screw it up. With a need at tackle, the Cardinals chose to take advantage of the depth at the position and wait until the third round to grab Josh Jones (4) of Houston. Jones was the 19th overall player on [my board](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184), so I obviously view this pick as a massive steal. Jones didn‚Äôt square off against many marquee pass-rushers, so his film was hard to evaluate in terms of translating to the next level. He won the vast majority of his matchups, showing sound technique, but few crazy displays of domination. He surely graded out well and moves well enough for me to endorse him as a quality starting left tackle in Arizona. People make a big deal about quarterbacks and wide receivers transitioning from spread offenses, but it‚Äôs also a whole new game for offensive linemen. With Kliff Kingsbury‚Äôs scheme taking a lot from the college game, Jones will be coached similar techniques to what he was taught at Houston. Great pick. A year after making the wise decision to jettison [Josh Rosen](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/19763/Josh+Rosen) and draft [Kyler Murray](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/20889/Kyler+Murray), the Cardinals put together a solid draft. They are talented enough to compete with the heavyweights in the NFC West, but maybe a year away from a playoff appearance. ## Los Angeles Rams The Rams essentially used their first-round pick on Jalen Ramsey, who probably would have gone 3rd overall in this draft class. Dealing a first for a veteran with a huge contract is always risky, especially with a highly (and possibly over) paid quarterback. They came into the draft needing help on defense. I don‚Äôt think they got much. When I originally sat down and watched [Cam Akers](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21688/Cam+Akers), I became disgusted with the Florida State offense. To say it was a mess is an understatement. Akers made mistakes as well, which made me sour on him quite a bit. I originally ranked Akers 9th in my running back rankings and was met with a fury. I had to go back and watch. You were all right. I had fallen in the same trap I warn draftniks about all the time - valuing college performance too much, and traits too little. If Cam Akers (4) has any work ethic at all, he‚Äôs going to have Pro Bowl seasons with Sean McVay. His traits are actually good enough that he can be an All-Pro if things break right. Akers‚Äô fundamentals and technique were subpar at Florida State. My coaching side also didn‚Äôt like his lack of ball security. However, it‚Äôs difficult to blame him with how poorly coached everyone else looked. Athletic and fast with decent hands, Akers has acceleration and creativity traits that translate to the NFL. He can break tackles and hit home runs. He‚Äôll overtake Darrell Henderson right away as the Rams‚Äô 1A back. I am glad I went for a second look. He is going to be a fantasy stud in the Rams zone running scheme. üì∑ [Van Jefferson](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21739/Van+Jefferson) (2) has the pedigree and route-running skills to be a quality NFL receiver. When asked to run routes with real breakpoints, he showed the body control and agility that can work in the NFL. However, the constant issue in his film is the lack of separation down the field. When schemed into shallow crosses and screens, Jefferson was productive, showing good hands. The top-end speed wasn‚Äôt there, and he doesn‚Äôt project as much of a run-after-catch threat. There is little evidence on film that he can get off press, but he has the demeanor that could work. I expect him to become a just-a-guy possession receiver. Terrell Lewis (2) has traits that play in the league, but he is going to need time to develop. The scariest thing about Lewis is his [injury history](https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2020/04/25/nfl-draft-rams-terrell-lewis-injury-analysis/). On the field, he shows dynamic athleticism and ideal twitch. However, he doesn't execute his gap assignments particularly well and will struggle to defend the run in the NFL. As a rotational edge rusher, it could work, but a lot of his sacks came on inside stunts. Lewis is a developmental project who needs to stay healthy and get stronger to make any positive impact. Straight from my Terrell Burgess (3) notes: ‚Äúquick and good.‚Äù Burgess projects as a slot corner or sub-package safety. He has hip fluidity, good feet, and covered tight ends well at Utah. I don‚Äôt expect him to be a plus in run defense. That Utah secondary was crazy. The Rams paid [Jared Goff](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/17922/Jared+Goff) and now have to live with the consequences. The 49ers have the most talent, [Russell Wilson](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/14536/Russell+Wilson) isn‚Äôt going anywhere, and the Cardinals are young with a franchise quarterback. The NFC West is probably the best division in football, and if Jared Goff doesn‚Äôt play better, the former hottest coach in the NFL will be looking at back-to-back seasons with no playoffs. ## San Francisco 49ers The defending NFC Champions traded away DeForest Buckner for the 13th-overall pick, giving them two first-rounders. They ended up trading down just one spot to No. 14 and actually using their original first to move up to No. 25. Overall they made just five picks, but with John Lynch‚Äôs body of work, fans have reason to be excited. Out goes Buckner, and in comes his replacement in Javon Kinlaw (4). Kinlaw was my No. 1 interior defensive lineman and 17th-ranked player on [my board](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184). He‚Äôs big and athletic with an inconsistent get-off. When he times up and correctly leverages his explosion off the ball, he‚Äôs very good. He can penetrate gaps, fight versus doubles, and bench press blockers off him. He showed a powerful bull rush against the Alabama right guard. The most underrated aspect of Kinlaw‚Äôs game is his ability to get his paws on passes. He can also block field goals. The 49ers' defensive line will continue to be a force. Trading up for [Brandon Aiyuk](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21747/Brandon+Aiyuk) (3) was extremely interesting considering the depth of this wide receiver class. [John Lynch admitted they considered](https://www.knbr.com/2020/04/28/john-lynch-says-49ers-had-brandon-aiyuk-ceedee-lamb-almost-dead-even-explains-what-separated-them/) [CeeDee Lamb](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21679/CeeDee+Lamb) at No. 13, but also would have been fine taking Aiyuk there. Get your guy, I guess. I do like Aiyuk, so I won‚Äôt bash the move at all. Aiyuk reminds me of Dez Bryant. He‚Äôs a competitive player with strong hands and good footwork in terms of breakpoints. My final note: he‚Äôs a stud, just needs to clean up some technique. Unfortunately, I do not believe he will unlock his full potential as the third receiving option in a run-heavy attack. He takes a while to get going, is a little clumsy, and showed some very sloppy release work at the line. A related observation: the special teams coordinator at Arizona State was excellent. The 49ers had a ten-point lead in the second half of the Super Bowl and return most of their starters. Yes, they lost Joe Staley, but they gained Trent Williams. Yes, they lost DeForest Buckner, but they gained Javon Kinlaw. John Lynch is doing a fantastic job. ## Seattle Seahawks Seahawks general manager John Schneider had an all-time great [draft class in 2012](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/2012_draft.htm) but hasn‚Äôt hit on a single first-round pick since. He has been below-average at drafting during that time, as Seahawks fans have seen a once-loaded roster deteriorate into essentially a one-man team. Just as bad, Pete Carroll continues to ignore math and put too much emphasis on running the football (ironic). Defensively, his tendency to play three linebackers on the field together too much has also hurt them. So of course with their first-round pick, they took an off-ball linebacker. I wrote [this article](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184) about ‚Äúmy guys‚Äù before the draft. Jordyn Brooks (4) was the first guy I featured. I believe he can be an impact pro, and he actually reminds me of Bobby Wagner a bit. However, it is tough to defend a Super Bowl contender taking an off-ball linebacker, likely pointing to keeping three linebackers on the field for too many snaps yet again. I do believe in the player though. Brooks plays fast, can key and diagnose, and has tremendous power on contact. When he meets a back in the hole, he drives him back. They liked to blitz him at Texas Tech, taking advantage of uncommon movement skills and acceleration. Against Oklahoma, he struggled a bit, primarily used to spy [Jalen Hurts](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21831/Jalen+Hurts). However, the fact his coaching staff gave him that assignment is telling. I predict he‚Äôll be an excellent pro. If they‚Äôre going to play three linebackers, at least one of them will be fast enough to keep up with Kyler Murray. In the second round, the Seahawks traded up for Darrell Taylor (2) of Tennessee. When I began writing the [‚Äúmy guys‚Äù article](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184), Taylor was supposed to be the second player I featured. I watched his film again simply looking for a highlight to make a gif of and became so unimpressed with Taylor that I decided to write about someone else. It was mainly Taylor‚Äôs film against Alabama that turned me off. The flip-flopping puts me in a ridiculous spot. I went back a third time and kind of liked him more again. Taylor can bend and his profile fits the Seahawks LEO position perfectly. He showed inconsistent handwork but generally was powerful on the edge with enough speed to keep tackles honest. He showed an ability to finish plays and force turnovers, something a lot of edge prospects struggle to do. There was an odd delay getting off the ball on almost every snap against BYU, but he showed a quick get-off in other games. Only one thing is for sure - he‚Äôs better than L.J. Collier. In the third, the Seahawks took my [92nd-ranked](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184) player in LSU guard Damien Lewis (2). Lewis will likely fit right in with Seattle‚Äôs underachieving offensive line. He‚Äôs good on double teams and has good enough feet to mirror but that‚Äôs about it. His functional strength and anchor is below average, getting knocked down by a blitzer and walked back by just one of Derrick Brown‚Äôs arms. Anything powerful gets him off-balance. There were better players on the board. üì∑ The Seahawks pride themselves in trading down and making picks against the consensus. It has not worked out at all in recent years. It would be a shame if their mishandling of drafts continues throughout Russell Wilson‚Äôs career. Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for the final division, the AFC West, in the coming days.

I‚Äôm 99% sure I‚Äôm straight- but my friend has a gay crush on me and I don‚Äôt know how to nicely turn her down. And I like someone else	Hey! So for some insight on this, I‚Äôm a girl. I identify as straight, I‚Äôve currently had a crush on a boy for 8 months and it‚Äôs the usual crush stuff- he makes me feel happy, I get butterflies etc. Recently I had been questioning my sexuality, and I think I got romantic attraction mixed up with admiration because my feelings aren‚Äôt the same when it‚Äôs a boy. So the other day, I found out one of my (female) friends has a crush on me. Even though I think I‚Äôm straight, I thought I had a crush on her too but I just couldn‚Äôt see it happening, (me and another female as a couple) and I kind of felt uncomfortable. I have a crush on a boy right now, but I thought I liked my friend at the same time. I‚Äôve realised it‚Äôs probably just admiration for her, I do love her a lot and I‚Äôm really glad we‚Äôre friends- she‚Äôs helped me so much- but I just don‚Äôt think I like her the way she likes me. I did experience similar feelings with her to my Male crush, except that I couldn‚Äôt see us dating/ kissing/ getting married/ etc... you know. It just didn‚Äôt feel right- because I‚Äôm not attracted to girls. I found out she liked me a few days ago, when I opened a Tellonym for my Instagram followers. I got a tell from someone saying they ‚Äúliked me but didn‚Äôt think I was gay‚Äù. I feel bad because when I found out, I was flustered because nobody had ever told me they liked me, especially a girl, and I responded in a way that might make someone think I wasn‚Äôt completely straight. I was really confused. Later, I found out it was her and it was a bit awkward, but then we became normal again. Here‚Äôs another thing: today is her birthday, and yesterday she posted something along the lines of ‚Äú tomorrow is my birthday, I have two wishes, one is the sky is clear and the stars are out and two, to be loved back. By them.‚Äù Reading this made me feel really bad because I only think of her as a friend- and I knew it was about me. She doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôve seen it. I don‚Äôt know what to do- I don‚Äôt want her to keep liking me when I don‚Äôt like her (in that way, again I love her as a friend!) and so that when she does find out I don‚Äôt like her, she can move on and find someone who will make her happy!

36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar. If you're on the same page, hit me up."	chat

Is P3 worth it despite getting spoiled?	"I got into the Persona series a couple of months ago and so far I'm loving it. Just finished P5 and now I'm about to finish P4 and after that I wanted to start playing P3 (more specifically, the Portable version for PS Vita). But just a couple of days ago, I got spoiled pretty bad by a random comment under a P4 OST video. It was about the death of the MC of P3 at the end of the game. Which leads to my question: ""Should I play P3 nonetheless?"". I know that this is a rather subjective topic but I'd like to hear your opinion. Is the story still good despite the spoiler, is this fact even only a little part of the ending or do the characters/gameplay compensate the rest?"	PERSoNA
MAGA (make Amagi great again)	Amagi got nerfed too hard. It was a great ship that took some knowledge to play well. Had her on the back burner for a long time and decided to play her today. Awful, horrible. It was bad after the initial nerf, but the current state of play is especially bad for this ship. Long range HE spam really eats her up. The armor isn‚Äôt good, the guns despite being 410s are not good, speed and handling very mediocre. Was my first T7 BB. Thinking im gonna sell her though, can‚Äôt see any reason to play her over an Iowa or JB.	WoWs_Legends

OK so I'm feeling kinda fucked.	"Last night I went out with the girl I 'm in love with, and I had told her that I had someone on my mind in a ""you know how"" way. We are friends for about 5 months now and she makes me feel happy, after a long time of me going through my life with a fake smile and getting out of bed with less and less exitement every day. Before we returned home, she hugged me for good night and I told her ""It's you"". She said ""I don't know what to say"" and I responded with ""You don't have to answer, it's just that the sooner I get it off my chest, the easier I'll move on with my life"" ( I know she has someone else in mind at the moment). Last thing she said was that she didn't want us to stop hanging out and talking, which I responded to with ""neither do I"". Lately, my mother and my brother fight quite regularly, so I can't cry at peace at home. She is the third person I have fallen in love with, and the third person who rejected me (although this time in a more mild way). I just hope I'll be able to act like normal around her from now on, so I can't lose the single thing making me smile and giving me strenght I know this is probably gonna get lost on ""new"" but what the hell. Sorry for any grammatical errors."	teenagers
Opinions for a newb	"First time poster here. I have a character concept that I was wondering how you guys would handle. This is my first M&M character, never played, and I'm excited to give it a shot! My basic idea is a guy who remotely controls a battlesuit style robot. He controls it from a sort of full body VR station that has limited range, so it is stationed on an air vehicle that is piloted by a minion. I'm probably using the control tech power from Power Profiles limited to the battlesuit. I will give it enhanced strength, flight, a strike power and a homing rockets power. (PL 10) I know this is a bit ""bathroom mentalist"", if I'm using that term correctly at all. So to negate that a bit, I am adding that the guy controlling the battlesuit/bot suffers the same fate as the battlesuit does. This might seem unnecessary but I really like the story implications of what is essentially remote control Iron Man. My question is, how would you guys roll this? Would you make the battesuit a construct? I'm VERY new to this. This might be a dumb concept but I'm curious as to how you'd roll it if you had to. Thanks for any and all insights!"	mutantsandmasterminds

Valorant review and why is csgo with powers	\[Don't hate me because this is just a review and I do like this game\] The Goal Of The Game Okay so this game is a 5v5 hero game where your main goal is to plant the spike at the enemy 3 bases or you can just kill the whole team both can be challenging for new players but not impossible but you will die quite a lot and like csgo you don't respawn which might be frustrating for some players. Gameplay: I have played about 20 hours of this game and got at least decent at it. The gameplay is fun but can be quick and slow with the rounds usually lasting me about 20-30 min each which still lasts longer then most guys. The game puts you in with both poor players and players that seem to have mastered the game and will easily punish you for any mistakes, this can be problematic for some but I kinda like it because if you started to get good you could feel it and it was a good feeling being able to have a win streak or being able to carry your team. Now lets get down team play, you are able to use the chat box but its not recommended because no will see it until the match is over because everyone else is focusing on the game. There are two other ways to chat with your team and that is to use the ping system or the best way chatting but in this game I have seen people use neither very much so far which is surprising because most other games like these have loads of people speaking. The Agents: The agents are Breach, Brimstone, Cypher, Jett, Omen, Phoenix, Raze, Sage, Sova, and Viper. So this game has a decent amount of agents that all feel different and I enjoy using pretty much all of them although I haven't mastered any of them yet but I do want to. I don't want to go into detail but I will leave a link at the end explaining what they do. Performance and Graphics: The games performance is good for my low end computer and it actually runs better then csgo, although some things look a bit worse mainly the guns which look poor but still decent enough to be passable although you won't want to look at them for long, this is a closed beta so I don't suspect every thing to look amazing. I personally think the agents look good and like how some of them look like Omen which looks cool. Everything Else: So here are just a couple of other things I want to point out and why its like csgo. So first they have skins which are stupidly expensive most would be fine if 5 maybe 8 dollars or less but instead even the most bland can be a total 25 DOLLARS, and some being $35 its stupid and needs to be priced lower especially since its closed beta. Now lets talk the famous anti-cheat, so it sucks not only do you have to restart your computer it goes to the level your operating system goes and its not okay for some random game to do and this needs to be changed also it hates drivers both my friend and me have a problem with this where it stops drivers from working which is weird. Next thing I like and hate are the twitch drops because you watch the streams that hopefully you have a streamer you like for 2 hours and then you might wait 2+ weeks to get it, I like it tho because you at least get to see the game first and it brings creators extra views and possibly new fans. And the last thing like csgo is the player base is pretty toxic with every match having someone being made fun of for not being good at this game even tho its quick play. So I give this game a 8/10 it being fun but not perfect but I do like this game more then csgo and if you like csgo I think there is a high chance of you liking this game.

Also ideally Big Law (would be open to clerking or something for a year but realize neither school has great clerkship stats).

System Security Flaw & Future Season Datamine	Good evening, My name is Dennis, and for the past two weeks I have been experimenting with an exploit inside Destiny 2's code to **gain access into a private resource archive inside Bungie's database**. As this is a security flaw, I will not dive into details; I have already contacted a Bungie representative so they may patch this flaw to avoid future datamined information. To protect my privacy, I am using a throwaway account. For some information, Destiny 2 directly connects to Bungie's authentication server which also provides headers to access local updates - these are the smaller patches that you may encounter in-game, however do require download outside of its execution (for example, through the Steam client). The software container that manages this authentication has a **serious flaw that allows anyone with a set of datamine skills to directly access private servers**. Humorously enough, this means you can access authentication servers without authentication. This allows you to view unreleased documentation and resources, including for upcoming releases. I believe this is the same exploit dataminer, Ginsor, used to leak Forsaken assets as they had explained that their source **was not an individual**. Despite contacting Bungie to warn them of the flaws exploitation, I have decided to leak a snippet of what I saw in the database - the next seasonal content, titled [**Season of Hope**](https://i.imgur.com/ZBe7Za4.jpg). This season returns players to the Dreaming City as the **curse is emitting fluctuations and the Vanguard believe that something sinister is going on**. I am unsure of how this links with the current season, however believe that the ending to this season may share some insight. The database contains what appears to be a print of a simplified work-breakdown structure (WBS), which from what I could make out leads me to believe that this season has had more employees working on it then all other seasons this year. Furthermore, this season does not rely on the grind for play, but instead revolves around exploration of the Dreaming City, and a new section of it, titled the **Conduit of Visions**. Inside this new area you will find many secrets, with new paths opening every week; In terms of atmosphere, this appears to be similar to the Corridors of Time from Season of Dawn. A low-quality document, which I was able to loosely translate from French, leads me to believe that **this season will include the infamous fifteen wish** as a device that will further the existing plot. The screenshot I found, linked above, appears to be taken from a work-in-progress trailer. Obviously, this is not all the season will offer - this is what I have found. In addition, I can conclude that the big expansion later this year will involve the darkness ships (no surprise there), however the ongoing plot that was hinted throughout next year will be based on the events of Season of Hope, and appears to **involve characters such the hinted Savathun**. The database also lists a new character named Aran-19, whose name resembling a hunter is the only information I have on them. Unfortunately, the majority of the documentation is subject to non-disclosure agreements, and leaking them would get me in serious legal trouble. The screenshot above is all I feel comfortable sharing. Furthermore, I understand if this information may cause doubt in the community of its legitimacy. Nothing I can do will influence your mindset, so I suggest waiting to see. Thank you for providing a platform to share this information.	raidsecrets

My adderall is helping me but I feel burnt out and with such busy....	I started this new job recently and the hours have gone up which is good the thing is that the schedules are hectic, they rotate too much, my sleep schedule is off and for the last week I have been sleeping 4 hours max or less. Anyway I have bipolar disorder also, so sleep disturbances really affect me as it is, however I have managed because I have to. The thing is I'm burnt out, the jobs I'm getting are also physically demanding so that's another dimension of it. I'm happy for the pay especially with the situation as it is and how I can use this hard time to make more money and save since spending is limited at the moment due to Covid. The issue is it's getting so bad I'm not functioning my best and my mind and body are taking a toll. I hardly eat, I am constantly going home doing chores then get done and only have 4 hours to sleep to start over. I'm taking my adderall daily but that adds to the physical side effects, because I'm so drained instead of skipping doses as I used to now I find myself needing them daily. I'm tired of it and need a break but between that and coffee for the time being I have no idea what I can do in such a situation. I haven't been working out, eating, sleeping, doing anything not to mention I'm getting paid less than I ever have for harder work, yet cannot do anything about it. Yet I'm grateful that while hard some self sacrifice will be worth it. Does anyone feel like this?

Special Ammo Economy needs a tune up, Special weapons don't need nerfs.	I have been seeing a lot of posts asking for nerfs to various special weapons like Bastion, MindBenders, Revoker, Erentils, Joutuun(for some reason) and ofcourse MountainTop. But IMO, special weapons aren't that broken now(Revoker is an exception), sure snipers could use a tune up in AimAssist and Flinch and mountainTop Sticky could be tuned too. But none of these things would stand out this much if Special Ammo wasn't so abundant in this game, hell in most Survival and 6v6 you can pretty much run nothing but you Special the entire round because of how much ammo you get and I have done similar things in Trials too, Special Ammo Economy needs to be toned down, I have a few ideas.. Tweaks to the existing system. *. Instead of 2 ammo, starting ammo should be turned to 1. *. Allied Guardian Deaths shouldn't drop Special Ammo, this way special starvation would be thing If the enemy don't run Specials. *. Max Scavenger pickup should be limited to 2 rounds, not more than that. *. Special Ammo shouldn't carry over to rounds....i don't understand this decision ? Why would you help snowballing in competitive modes ? *. Reviving allies should give them special Ammo.	DestinyTheGame

Extremely slow speeds (95 down/65 up) when suppose to be getting gig even with all new equipment	So starting last week I was getting extremely slow speeds. I troubleshooted my equipment (unifi) and everything was fine. I go to the router and noticed that I would still get less than 100 down when directly connected to the router. I called ATT and they ran tests and said I was getting 950 to the router so it must be my equipment. I informed them that I was getting the same 100 down with all my equipment disconnected so they said they would send a new router. The next day I lost all internet all together so they sent a tech out yesterday. &#x200B; The tech replaced the router, ONT, new ethernet connectors on the wire running from router to ONT and reprovisioned my account. When he was done I was back to my 850-950 range. &#x200B; Woke up this morning and back to 100 down. I again, tested on the router and same speeds. I power cycled everything, changed out ethernet to my equipment and tested a brand new ethernet wire on my laptop. I used a cable tester on the cable from the router to the ONT and no issues. When I run tests on ATT website it shows no issues. When I do a speedtest on the router, it gives me 950 range. However when I do a speedtest from a laptop connected to the router I am at less than 100. My setup: Motorola BGW210-700: 2g and 5g radios off, IP Passthrough to my unifi equipment. &#x200B; Any thoughts to look into? Going to try and call them again today but, while they are doing the best they can, speaking to the Lev 1 tech support gets me nowhere (The first person I spoke to was trying to explain that my slow internet was because my 2g and 5g wifi radios were off).

The only thing that kept me going during quarantine was school and now I'm done. I didn't even make the final exams cause they were cancelled. And now I graduated? There was no official moment or something we just had to figure it out ourselves. So obviously I told my parents and they werent very happy. They told me, eventhough I have no fail marks, I should try to redo a few tests to improve my marks. Isnt this good enough?? I feel like I didn't deserve this. I could never passed this year if it was a regular one. I'll probably will be stuck inside until college starts instead of travelling around Europe and visiting festivals. And next week, It's my birthday. I Always imagined my 18th birthday party as the best party of my life. Finally able to do everything and party all night with my friends. Well, that's not gonna happen either. It will just be me and my parents drinking a (1) beer together in our house.

My questions are: * I wonder what the lineup would have looked like? * Will they bother announcing the lineup before cancelling it? * How long will it be until they officially make the announcement that it is cancelled?	primaverasound

Slipped yet again	What do you know? I tried to keep from drinking on my own, and it didn't work. Nothing went according to plan yesterday, and I really pissed off my partner. I thought I would try some controlled drinking, just to be sure, and blacked out. Based on my experience, I will know not to drink for a month or so before I end up with the bottle. I would love to hear some encouraging words from anyone who failed many times before achieving long term sobriety, also, any recommendations are welcome. Thanks for being here y'all!	alcoholicsanonymous

I (M) Like To Finger My Ass	Over the weekend, the wife was gone visiting her family. I stayed home and told her I had some work to do. Once she left I turned on some porn and slowly started to stroke my cock. I've recently gotten more into edging so I took it slow. Then I put some lube on my finger and started playing with my ass. I again took it slow, only making circles around my hole. I played with my balls and taint and started to relax. Once I was relaxed enough, I stuck my finger in my ass. I continued to stroke my cock while I fucked my ass with my finger. It felt amazing. Not long after I knew I was going to cum so I shoved my whole finger in as I came. It was an amazing orgasm. Now I just need to convince the wife to do it to me and probably buy a prostate massager.	SluttyConfessions
The Next Covid Crisis Could Be a Wave of Suicides	The isolation, grief and economic hardship related to Covid-19 are creating a mental health crisis in the U.S. that researchers warn could make the already-rising suicide rate worse. A study [released Friday](https://wellbeingtrust.org/) tried to quantify the toll. The paper, which was not peer-reviewed, found that over the next decade as many as 75,000 additional people could die from ‚Äúdeaths of despair‚Äù as a result of the coronavirus crisis, a term that refers to suicides and substance-abuse-related deaths. The research was done by the Well Being Trust and researchers affiliated with the American Academy of Family Physicians. ‚ÄúI hope in 10 years people look back and say, ‚ÄòWow, they way overestimated it,‚Äô‚Äù said John Westfall, director of the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care, who co-wrote the report. Even as the American economy rebounded after the last recession, suicides and overdoses cut into Americans‚Äô life expectancy. Mental health experts worry that the economic uncertainty and social isolation of the pandemic will make things worse at a time when the health care system is already overwhelmed.

High level advice for what platform to use next	"After finishing my move to hubitat i wanted to share some advice. wanted to give a high level oversimplification of some of the options out there. i see people jumping from wink on this sub and hubitat forums and twitter and elsewhere and complaining about what wink is and how to find something that works that way still. First identify how you use wink today, and how you want to use ""automation"" if today you use wink as a universal remote control, being that you turn on and off things with voice, or the wink app. and dont use robots for anything you may want to look at simple solutions. the first simple solution is go wifi only. ditch zwave and zigbee, go with devices that work with echo or google home, and don't require a hub. And use voice and the alexa or google home app for control. you can also use those apps to build out basic automatons. This gives you the Easiest path to a universal remote. But does have lots of drawbacks. you are cloud dependent, you are depended on a bunch of small apps and integrations. but this works. The second option is to build on what is up above. you can buy a Amazon show and use some zigbee devices, you can buy into a platform like smart things and use both zwave and zigbee. amazon show option is still super easy. the smart things option you start to move away from the ""universal remote automation"" and have a device that takes a little more tech knowledge. this now gives you the ability to start customizing what you are doing, and moving from a glorified remote control, to a automation system. you can select device drivers, you still have an app you can use, you can still tie into alexa and google home. but you can also build more complicated routines. you also can use a lot more products. But you are still tied to the cloud. Leaving smart things the next step up is hubitat, you can now call this full automation. its ability to build out rules and automate your house is currently best in the game. you still have the ability to do voice assistants, but that is an after thought. everything is controlled locally at your house, you have to do everything manually. if you want a app you can have one but you have to build it, you build the dash boards that go on it, with what devices etc. the local control and flexibility, and compatibility is superior to anything else. but if you want a ""universal remote"" and not for all your lights to do something only on tuesdays between 6 and 7 and only if the front door is unlocked and its an average of 78* in your house. then avoid hubitat."	winkhub

ContraPoints‚Äô theory of cringe - what motivates us to snark?	Natalie Wynn aka ContraPoints posted a really excellent video yesterday called [‚ÄúCringe.‚Äù](https://youtu.be/vRBsaJPkt2Q) She draws a distinction between embarrassment cringe and contemptuous cringe - essentially, cringing with someone vs cringing AT them. Watching the video I couldn‚Äôt help but think of the CC snark community, and by the end I was feeling rather morally implicated myself, and was definitely left questioning what I am doing on this sub and why I follow caroline. If you have an hour and a half to spare (and let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs quarantine baby, most of us have nothing but time), I highly recommend checking the video out. There has already been a bit of discussion on the general thread, but I really think there is so much to talk about here. I‚Äôll copy/paste a bit of what I said in the general: I also felt like a lot of what she talked about could be related to caroline and the snark community, especially her idea of ‚Äúmorbid cringe‚Äù where hate following becomes an obsession. I know watching an hour and a half video of kind of a big ask for some but I would really like to hear what people here have to say about their motivations for snarking after watching CP‚Äôs cringe vid. CP makes the case that a lot of people who hate follow a cringe figure do so because that figure reminds them of something they dislike about themselves, which she calls in group cringe. Personally I think there‚Äôs a bit of truth to that last point because I do suspect most of the people in this community are also white women. (Btw has there ever been a demographics type poll on here? There should be.) But I don‚Äôt think that can neatly explain why snarkers snark. People outside the subreddit sometimes come in and say we‚Äôre basically all just jealous of her, and although I think there‚Äôs more to it than that I also think there‚Äôs a shred of truth to that statement as well. The most common sentiment I see on here is basically ‚ÄúI work so much harder than CC but I don‚Äôt have what she has, and that‚Äôs not fair.‚Äù I feel like that comes closer to what strikes a nerve with most people on here. Even though it‚Äôs a CC snark subreddit, it‚Äôs almost about more than CC - she‚Äôs almost like an avatar for the general phenomena of unearned privilege, toxic white womanhood, failing upward, etc. So the in group cringe idea is not quite right here because I don‚Äôt think most people here are reminded of themselves by CC, but I DO think that for most of us she does hit on some sort of insecurity or frustration about our own life circumstances. But let me know what y‚Äôall think. ________ As someone pointed out in the general thread, I think for most of us our initial knee jerk response is to distance ourselves from the cringe trolls Natalie references in her video, or even from the other people on this subreddit - ‚Äúwell I haven‚Äôt done x y z so I‚Äôm not as bad as them.‚Äù But the fact of the matter is we all come together here to essentially make fun of a deeply mentally ill woman, and that‚Äôs never going to be a 100% morally righteous thing. However, unlike the trolls in CP‚Äôs video, and despite what people unfamiliar with the sub would probably think, I actually believe the people here can be trusted to have an intelligent, self aware discussion about why we are actually here and what we get out of snarking on CC. So I encourage you all to share your thoughts here. üòä	SmolBeanSnark

My original plan was to hook it up and use cloud print, but since google is getting rid of cloud print, I am not entirely sure if that's even viable. What are my alternatives? Paul	chromeos

Replacement Battery for 2016 Mazda 3 (US spec, currently living in Europe)	Pretty much what it says in the subject line- I own a US spec Mazda 3 i Touring, does not have i Eloop, so far as I'm aware, and I'm currently living in France. I managed to leave the map light on the last time I drove the car, and between COVID-19 and the fact that we really only use the car for road trips and big grocery outings, it sat in the garage for a week, until I went to drive it today and found it dead. I tried jumping the battery with zero success, so I'm guessing that at this point, it's dead and needs to be replaced. I'm now looking around on Amazon and some car parts sites, trying to figure out which type of battery I need, but I'm having some trouble figuring out which batteries will be compatible with the car. If I just take the measurements of the current battery, will pretty much anything that fits in the tray work with the car, or are there other factors I should keep in mind? Am I going to run into issues using a European battery in a US car? The car is dead in our neighborhood parking garage, so ideally, I'd like to buy a new battery and do the replacement myself, rather than pay for towing, labor, having to discuss mechanical issues in French at a garage, et cetera, but I don't want to ruin the car, either. Thanks in advance for any help or advice!	mazda3
Running Man Member Injuries	I believe it is now known to most of us that RM members have suffered significant injuries while filming RM and thus, and justifiably so, they don't do the same physical activities they've done before. And I, for one, fully supports them for that. In a YouTube interview with Haha, he mentioned one episode where they got herniated disc injuries. Does anyone know what Running Man episode is that where they got the herniated disc injuries? Are there also other episodes that anyone knows where the members could have suffered major injuries?	runningman

Final Fantasy-esque book recommendations?	Hey, I posted this over in r/fantasy too but thought I would do so here as well to see if I can pick up any additional recommendations. **Specifically, what I'm looking for is a book with, like many FF games, an ensemble cast of distinct characters with strong personalities; a feeling of friendship, teamwork and fun; and a character-driven epic quest.** My favourite FFs are VI and IX so **my preferred flavour is high fantasy / steampunk, but I'm not AS interested in the flavour as those elements above.** In other words airships are optional, and only an added bonus. I'm more interested in the elements listed above. So far the books that I have read that hit this most are * The Chronicles of Prydain * The Aeronaut's Windlass (clearly inspired by FFVI and Skies of Arcadia, among other things) * A fanfiction novelisation of FFVI... * and, weirdly, Brian Bendis' New Avengers comic run: an amazing example of ensemble cast characterisation, IMO. Things already on my TBR list from research so far are: * Sufficiently Advanced Magic and stuff by Andrew Rowe * Ember in the Ashes * Kings of the Wyld (Reading this now. Absolutely excellent!) * Seven Blades in Black * Dragonlance * Rogues of the Republic * Stuff by Chris Wooding Anyone got any more?	FinalFantasy
Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2 - Most Essential Everyday Jacket Review (YouTube)	Hi all, Posted this review in the Arc'teryx sub with positive responses, and thought I share in the BIFL sub as it definitely qualifies. When people think of Arc'teryx, they usually associate the brand with Climbing, Skiing, Hiking and maybe even Trail Running or Biking. And those that are very familiar Arc'teryx know that their products are some of the most expensive outdoor apparel but built with high standards of quality and perhaps the best warranty in the business, that makes the product you've invested in truly BI4L. However, what most people do not know that Arc'teryx also sells high quality military spec'd products to Law Enforcement and Armed Forces (LEAF). And one of the most popular jackets from Arc'teryx, the Atom LT, has a LEAF version, the Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Gen 2, which can be used as an everyday BI4L spring/fall and mild winter jacket. Below is a 2 Part comprehensive YouTube Review of the Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2, outlining why it should be considered the best most essential everyday spring/fall jacket. **Part 1** \- Outlines MUST and SHOULD Criteria and Candidates for Comparison [https://youtu.be/MLVf0gC7rAs](https://youtu.be/MLVf0gC7rAs) **Part 2** \- Visual and Hands On Review \- Comparison of Product Feature Differences and Advantages over the civilian Atom LT Hoody \- Hood, Shell, Liner comparisons vs other Arc'teryx jackets \- Fit and Layering Options \- Pros and Cons Summary [https://youtu.be/H8GtwJ2uizs](https://youtu.be/H8GtwJ2uizs) Please forgive the length of each video, as I wanted to be thorough in the comparisons and provide as much detail covering all the key technical aspects and benefits for the everyday user of the LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2, as there are not too many reviews on this jacket. Feel free to comment either here or in the YouTube comments section; and whether there are other jackets that should have been considered based on the criteria or have any questions on the LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2 jacket itself. Cheers!	BuyItForLife

What are some debunked theories that you're glad were wrong?	To me, the theory that the Yonko had no bounties always made absolutely no sense at all. The only idea behind it was that the Yonko were too strong for any bounty hunters to defeat them, but that just doesn't logically follow with how the World Government operates. First of all, that's basically an admission that these people are too powerful for the World Government to defeat, and that they're more or less above the law. This completely doesn't vibe with the sense of absolute control over the world that the WG likes to front. Secondly, these people weren't *born* Yonko, they *became* Yonko. Meaning they had long careers of piracy before reaching the status, and would have accumulated a bounty. Would the world government just rescind someone's bounty because they feel like nobody can handle them? Or would they put a big price on their heads in the hopes that someone incredibly strong, or maybe a group of incredibly strong people, would go out and bring them in? The whole theory was just completely illogical, and it was a good day when the chapter came out that revealed Blackbeard's bounty. How about you guys? Any theories that you are glad didn't come true?

Hey, Comrades. I'm an Iranian Socialist and I would love to answer anyone who has a question about Iran, Islam, and the Middle-East.	So, I've encountered many left-leaning people who were really misinformed about Iran mainly because there's simply too much misinformation and bias about my country and well-educated Iranians who can communicate with the westerners aren't really helpful either. So, I thought I should do this to clarify some questions you beautiful people might have. I'm a 23-year old, pansexual man. I'm an atheist and a democratic socialist.	socialism
Integration with iTunes and/or Rythmbox	I‚Äôm currently in the process of switching from Linux, though at the moment I use a semi-broken MacBook running in a handicapped state of sorts. That‚Äôs all besides the point though. I was wondering if theres a way to use Jellyfin to listen to music through Rythmbox on Linux or iTunes on macOS. If possible, I‚Äôd prefer to have it work via a sync system where music from Jellyfin is cached locally, so I can listen offline. However, I open to any solutions or resources.	jellyfin

Women are so backwards.	"Hey, I am a 19 year old dude. I was a super late bloomer. Was Ugly all my life, now that I have 'Glowed up', my life has completely changed.

I used to be super ugly in highschool, so that was a surprise. \-Going out shopping, I can see the differences in the way women treat me. \-I went to get a Krispy Kreme doughnut, and the woman ""Chose the biggest ones out just for me"", and gave me two extra doughnuts. \-I get window seats in nice restaurants, and get discount coupons. \-I get extra sausages and mash potatoes for breakfast from the woman behind the cafe desk in the mornings. \-I get free drinks at the pub on Friday nights. \-All the girls working at my local starbucks know me somehow? And they give me like 4 free coffee stamps whenever I get a coffee. &#x200B; There is so much more that I can say. I am so disgusted that I am getting this treatment just because of the way that I look now. &#x200B; I know I shouldn't be pissed but seriously, this world is fucked up.

What age were you when you started to pursue a CRNA degree?	Hello! Just curious, at what age did everyone receive their CRNA degree? I am currently enrolled in nursing school and at the very beginning chapter of my journey into nursing. I just turned 35, that being said, by the time I graduate and hopefully gain some critical care experience, I probably would be in my early to mid 40‚Äôs, by the time I would be qualified to start applying to CRNA school (as this is the direction I am looking to pursue). Is this a common age range, or would I be on the older end of the spectrum? Just curious to hear what other people‚Äôs experiences have been. Thanks!	CRNA

Conspiracy of Kings re-read, Chapters 6-8	These chapters are short, so I decided to do three this week. Take a deep breath, we're about to approach the crossroads of fate! # CHAPTER SIX >Maybe I don‚Äôt know which Gen is real. But I know there was nothing feigned about his emotions after he had been beaten. > >Where, I wondered, was *my* wounded pride? Where was my outrage? My self-respect? Nowhere, it seemed. My back hurt. I lay there on my pallet, hoping it would improve soon and wondering, in a distant, unreproachful way, if I was any kind of man at all, and decided that I probably wasn‚Äôt. Sophos tells the story that his tutor told him of Morpos‚Äôs choice -- where a young man stumbles upon a temple in the woods, bares his throat to the wolf that guards it, and then takes the wolf away with him as the gift from the goddess of the temple. Then he intervenes to stop the beating of another slave, Dirnes, by a soldier he runs into by accident. The soldier visits the slave barracks and complains about Sophos. So Ochtos, the overseer, beats Sophos to punish him. Dirnes is upset (‚Äúslaves don‚Äôt do favors for other slaves‚Äù) but they reconcile over an iced cake. Spring comes, and one day he looks up and sees his father on the road. # CHAPTER SEVEN >What would I choose if I could have anything? Well, I wouldn‚Äôt be useless. I would be the statesman my father wanted and the prince my country needed. But that wasn‚Äôt what I was offered. I was still the same poor excuse for a prince that I had always been. Quite likely I would fail to be of any use at all--to my father or anyone. When the rebelling barons were put down, I would see my uncle marry and produce an heir far superior to me, and I would be despised as useless and unwelcome even in my own home. That was what I was choosing. > >I wonder if people always choose what will make them unhappy. Sophos considers the choice before him -- even briefly dreaming of his tutor asking him what he wants -- and then before dinner that night leaves the slave barracks. He punches a house boy and then takes his shirt in order to sneak into the megaron and beg Berrone for help. He spins her a story of woe and she helps him to misdirect the steward and get a new shirt so he can serve his father‚Äôs men at the dinner that night. Berrone‚Äôs brother comes in and reveals that the men are going to wear knives to dinner that night. # CHAPTER EIGHT >I lifted the lightweight stable boy on my own, even as I asked Ochto what in the name of all that was sacred he thought he was doing. > >‚ÄúHelping you,‚Äù said Dirnes. > >‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù > >They put the soldier down, and Ochto straightened to look me in the eye. ‚ÄúBecause I know nothing about kings and princes, but I know men.‚Äù > >‚ÄúAre you *mad*?‚Äù I asked. Sophos serves wine around the dinner table and warns his father of Hanaktos‚Äôs impending attack. Then he goes around to warn the other men to be ready when he drops the amphora. He runs quickly down to the stables to get the horses ready so they can flee, but gets interrupted by the soldier who once caused him to be beaten. Ochto and Dirnes come to the rescue. Sophos returns to the dinner, but the houseboy he punched is there now -- he‚Äôs waiting for Sophos with armed men to drag him away and keep him from dropping the amphora.They fight, the amphora drops, and then a giant brawl breaks out as they all make their escape from Hanaktos and his men. # COMMENTARY So Sophos is just about to get to a critical juncture in his story -- when he has to make a choice between staying a slave or not -- and he interrupts himself to tell the story of Morpos‚Äôs choice instead. This is a story told to him by Moira and he thinks about it a lot, so you know it‚Äôs also got to be important to the overall story and to his character. So you‚Äôve had some time to ponder since I last introduced the question: Who or what is the wolf? Sophos indicates later on that he thinks the wolf is Attolis. He surrenders his sovereignty to Attolis like Morpos offers the wolf his throat. Then, just as the wolf protected Morpos from the bandits, Attolis provides the men and resources necessary to win back his country from the rebels. And this is certainly what happens in the story, but I also think there‚Äôs another layer of thematic meaning. I think about this a lot and I go back and forth, but largely I settle on one of two ideas: The wolf is *true masculinity.* It is Sophos‚Äôs own desire for power and aggression -- the long-suppressed masculine side of his nature, if you will. He has to accept it and submit to it to survive to even get to the temple to make the choice. Then he has to choose what to take with him from the temple. He could take the sword (which represents the cultural expression of masculinity -- which will result in a life full of blood and conflict) or the gold (the intellectual path he has chosen thus far, which will ultimately leave him with nothing) but he chooses the wolf. He chooses to forge his own path, fraught with risks, but also with potential. My other theory, which contradicts the other, is that the wolf is *the risk of* *failure*. Sophos endlessly berates himself for his own failures and lives in fear of more failures. The life of a slave is the one time he is released from failure because nobody expects anything of him. But once he surrenders to it, accepts it, is willing to risk it, he can start moving on. He takes it with him and it may turn on him -- he COULD actually fail and even expects to fail -- but it‚Äôs better than his other options. I think you could also make arguments for many other concepts. Basically, the temple represents the crossroads of fate -- you get there without planning on it, without being aware of what is coming -- but the choice you make will be key to the rest of your life. Don‚Äôt be careless about making that choice! So, back to the other things that happen in these chapters: It‚Äôs very fitting that Sophos gets promoted to wall-building. It is both an intellectual and physical activity, so it‚Äôs a sign he‚Äôs coming into balance. It‚Äôs also, perhaps, a metaphor for being a king -- how an accumulation of small decisions build into something large and enduring. Oh, and for Sophos‚Äôs self-descriptions, there‚Äôs not much new in these chapters: he adds ‚Äúan unruly slave‚Äù, ‚Äúa field hand‚Äù, ‚Äúa failure as a man, a prince, and a son‚Äù, ‚Äúthe same poor excuse for a prince that I had always been‚Äù and ‚Äúa poor lost soul‚Äù (when enlisting Berrone‚Äôs help). So he‚Äôs back to being really hard on himself, especially as he makes the choice to leave the easier life as a slave. You can see my pull quotes for these chapters are all pretty woeful. He's so hard on himself! To go more into the first quote, from Chapter 6, he really beats himself up over not throwing a tantrum when he‚Äôs beaten by Ochto. It kind of makes me want to hit my head against the wall -- how does he not see that the stoicism he shows is actually *incredibly* manly? To take a beating he doesn‚Äôt deserve in order to save a friend from that same beating, to not cry about it, to be able to say, okay, my back hurts but my pride and my ego are fine -- that‚Äôs a very adult way to behave. An explosive temper is not what makes a man. (Though many of the men in his life DO have dangerous and explosive tempers, and that has contributed, in my opinion, to many of Sophos‚Äôs problems.) These chapters are short, but there‚Äôs a lot in them. What stuck out to you?	queensthief

VIP 14 or Books of Covenant to rush T5?	I'm a mid-tier spender (growth fund, monthy gem supply, recharge events, and a few daily chests).I just got VIP12 and I have the gems to go just to vip 13 (around 150k gems).I'm only spinning wheels 10 times , as I still don't know for sure my troop orientation and my target commanders, and that's why I wanted to focus on getting as many universal heads as I can.So my objective was always vip 14.But as a ch25, I just realised I will soon be out of buildings to upgrade for a long time if I don't upgrade my castle which is still level 18 ( I am missing around 163k gems worth of books) . the rate I acquire books is very low (I recently started doing forts as much as i can and get around 50 books per day, so I will need more than 320 days to gather all books for free).Plus I want the extra 7% research speed the level 25 academy will give me, as I still have a heap of research to do before T5, and more than a year of universal speedups (not enough for T5 still, but I am acquiring many speedups from alliance gifts every day, because I'm in a spenders' alliance). So I'm in a dilemma: 1. will I use a large amount of gems on books when my building comes to a halt, in order to win valuable research time and get sooner to T5? but on the same time, lose months of vip 14 (and thus a corresponding amount of gold heads), or 2. use it only on vip and just ramp up on forts. as a result, in the long run I would have a few hundreds gold heads more, but I would lose a lot of research time, and my building would be at a halt for months, and T5 would come many months or even more than a year later. My aim is to kick some asses in war, and for this I need both T5 AND expertised top tier legendaries. I know everyone thinks differently, so I'm not asking you what to do.I'm asking what would you do in my position.	RiseofKingdoms

Threatening Jury Votes Strategy	"This is a strategy I've wondered about while rewatching RI and other seasons and I don't know of it's even allowed. After the merge in RI, Ometepe is up 7-5 and vote out one of their own. Now 6-5, Zapatera works like crazy to try and get one of them to open up their eyes and see that they are brainwashed robots. Alas, they don't and the get Pagonged. My idea for a strategy is this: After the first Zapatera member gets picked off and the numbers are 6-4, they see the writing on the wall and are pretty much sitting ducks. They know Rob is completely in control and brainwashed his fellow 5 Ometepe members. What if they go up to Rob and say, ""We know you're in control, if you don't take put a few Ometepe people before you tale all of us out, the 4 of us will vote against you at FTC."" Let's just say it's not a bluff and they will follow through with it. That would force Rob to do something, because if someone is definitely getting 4 votes at FTC, then all they need is 1 more and hes screwed. I've only seem s1-22 and s38-40. Has this strategy ever been used or thought of? Is it allowed? What are your thoughts?"	survivor

So after 7+ Months of no contact and 9+ months after she broke up with me I finally texted my ex 2 days ago	"And after exchanging texts over a couple days I can honestly say I have no interest in her anymore. For full context, I reached out because I reached a point where I was healed enough so that anything she could say wouldn't hurt me. Dealing with the breakup was one of the most emotionally taxing things I've had to do so this was a big deal for me. Anyway, she was excited to hear from me initially which was good but after we talked a little bit it became clear she kind of sucks now. All she does is play animal farm, go on picnics, and work. Of course is totally fine but very much not my thing. Also she felt the need to talk down to me despite still working a minimum wage internship and a second job while I managed to advance my career pretty far since we broke up which bothered the hell out of me. I guess it was very clear she was still in a college mindset. And all of this just fed into my prior frustration with her that she calls herself an ""empath"" because she likes to present herself as super caring and what not but its all performative and self serving. Eventually the conversation just fizzled out but the conversation is not my point. My point is that we get our closure from the weirdest places. The chances are your ex is no longer the person you loved or even you're not the person they loved. I think I'll always love her but its clear we're incompatible. Now I'm not saying go and text your ex, I waited a VERY long time before reaching out. But just know that if you reached out the interaction would have gone very similar to mine. With that said, thanks for reading and feel free to DM me if you need anyone to talk to who's been through what your going through :)"	BreakUps

Next day, same thing happens, put in a glass box when he tried to play with his friend. He asked his friend why he keeps doing that, and his friend said my kid ""griefs too much"". My kid logged off again and was upset he couldn't play with this friend. He came to my wife and I, and asked what does ""griefing"" mean. I said i have no idea (in the context of the game). I tried googling it, but figured I'd take my situation to the Reddit community itself. What does ""griefing"" even mean in Minecraft terms? How can my kid stop doing this griefing? What's up with the glass box? Is that a Minecraft thing too? Sorry for all the questions that I should know the answers to. I play online too, but don't play with tons of people. I usually play solo and have no idea what this lingo is. Thanks!"	Minecraft
I don't know what to do.	"So.... With the corona virus going on in my home country and we're currently in lockdown staying at home with my family members is actually making me have depressive episodes more often. I kept thinking of all the bads that associates to this place I try to call ""home"" is really taking a toll on me. I feel like for an Asian family my household is really really abnormal here are some of the craziest shit my family did to me. My aunt forced me to smoke a puff of her cigarette when I was younger(about 6). My uncle ""disciplined"" me into learning things that's not even in school like writing Buddhism scripts that's not even in Chinese(my native language) My brother tried to force himself on me when i was 10 and I still remember it vividly 10 years later. We share a room with my grandmother and it pains me to be in her knowing it almost took place in this room. My mother is not senile yet she doesn't even remember my name and always calls me by my younger sister name. My younger sister pins all her faults on me which the adults just side with her despite me being the most excellent academically out of my siblings. I was accused of stealing money which I never did because of my ""cosplaying hobby"" I tried to open up to relatives that's close to me about all these depressive thoughts but they kept giving the excuse of ""you so young where got depression"" I'm having home based learning and since my father sets up our home pcs literally in a straight line in the living room I can't focus on the one thing that made me feel alive -my academics. I don't know if it's normal to cry and breakdown everyday having weird heart palpitations, nosebleeding puddles of blood enough to cover my bathroom occasionally but I just don't know what to do..... Why do I feel so sad so miserable. I've tried going to counsellor or rather the school called them for me and they always give the same words of ""do you want me to call your parents "" as if they know anything at all. I'm just so tired from dawn to dusk everyday.... I don't even have close friends dear to me... I have a boyfriend but honestly I feel so indifferent sometimes because of how shallow he thinks my issues are when I try to seek comfort in him. Which always somehow resulted in him crying and me comforting him. The cycle continues...what should I do to get over all of these thoughts..."	depression_help
Adding Tow Option to Existing Y Order	I have an existing Model Y order that I would like to add the Tow option on. When I tired to do it online they said the base price of the car would go up in addition to the price of the Tow. Has anyone had any luck getting that added without the price going up? Also, has anyone been given a timeline on orders with the Tow option? Lastly, has there been any confirmation that it can be added after delivery? Thanks everyone.	TeslaLounge

A tribute to a Syrian Christian who defended his people from attacks from all around. Let us pray for Christians in the Middle East	"In 2012 Syrian Defense Minister and Colonel General Dawoud Rajiha was killed by the western-backed ""rebels"" intent on destroying Syria's pluralistic nature. Dawoud Rajiha, was a member of Syria's Christian minority, and was the head of the entire Syrian military. Syria was one of the few places in the Middle East where Christians could feel safe, but the West did not care about that. The West and the Zionists could not stand an Arab nation being sovereign and putting its own interests first. The West and the Zionists also wanted to push the narrative that all Arab Muslims oppress the Christians of the Middle East, and that Middle Eastern Christians do not want to liberate Palestine. But, this is not true, and the West and the Zionists do not want the West to know about Dawoud Rajiha and how Syria really is. They do not want the West to know that Rajiha commanded a unit of the Syrian Army that defeated the Israeli Army at the Battle of Sultan Yacoub in 1982. Many of the Syrian protestors in 2011 hated Christians, and were chanting, ""Christians to Beruit, Alawites to the grave."" Rajiha was sanctioned by the US and the EU for defending his community from people who wanted them dead or out of the country, Sadly, the West empowered these ""moderate"" rebels, and they killed Rajiha, and as a result of the West empowering these ""moderate"" rebels and creating an environment for ISIS and al-Qaeda to flourish, there has been a genocide and displacement of Christians in Syria. The West and the Zionists want a ""pro-West"" Wahabi/Salafist government taking over Syria, even if it means there are not religious minorities in Syria. Let us pray for Syria's religious minorities, and let us pray for a just peace in the Middle East. Here is article about Rajiha- [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/general-dawoud-rajha-one-of-the-architects-of-the-syrian-crackdown-7966116.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/general-dawoud-rajha-one-of-the-architects-of-the-syrian-crackdown-7966116.html)"	Catholicism

You should always the respect the pronouns of other people	Its simple respect, just respect how others want to be treated as such. You don't have to agree with them even, but you should just always respect everyone. Asking for someone's pronouns should also be more common. People that disrespect pronouns because they don't agree with a gender non conforming person's ideologies is just an asshole. Just treat people nicely. &#x200B; edit: noticed i put a the before respect, but oof im to lazy to remake the entire post because of that.	unpopularopinion
How do you be yourself everywhere you go?	Everyday is a challenge for me because I can only be myself in the company of myself.

I have social anxiety so that plays a big role in it. But I‚Äôm getting drained and tired of feeling like everyday is a survival game. It‚Äôs literally causing my depression to become worse.	Advice
[Tool] If YOU don‚Äôt set your top priorities, SOMEONE ELSE will set them for you. Here‚Äôs HOW to take control.	LPT: If you don‚Äôt select your *own* priorities, then *someone else will*. Be it a boss, a friend, a child, your partner, a pet, a parent, a celebrity, or a religious leader ‚Äî you may love them, but should they be setting your priorities? No, that‚Äôs your decision to make. Start by **making a list of your top 10 PRIORITIES**. Making the list is the MOST IMPORTANT aspect of taking control. Once you‚Äôve made the list, use it as your tool to guide your activities. **Post the list** somewhere where it will be available for regular review. Then, **list your current ACTIVITIES** in which you participate: Do your *activities* match your *priorities*? **Cut out activities** that don‚Äôt match your priorities. Learn to say no. Then, **decide on new activities** that match your priorities, write them down, and figure out a way to fit them into your life. You can use the **ten-minute method**: if you find yourself with 10 extra minutes, refer to your priorities list and use those 10 minutes to participate in an activity that furthers one or more priority. **You CAN take control of your life!**	GetMotivated

20[f4M] Poland - I had an Internship at a german Company...	... far from home, so I could do some things I would've never done at home. Unfortunately it was cut short by Corona, and I'll probably not be able to go back once it's finished. That's why I'm here, to talk about my time in Germany, what I enjoyed, and what I didn't enjoy so much. As such, you can talk to me either in polish or german, I'm fluent in both, as well as english. And to make sure that I know that I'm in the right subreddit: [this was one of the outfits I actually wore to work](https://i.imgur.com/5BqBxFg.jpg). Ask me whatever you'd like!	dirtyr4r
I almost became emotionally attached to a Transsexual escort	"I was perusing the internet for TS girls like any other weekend and stumbled upon a girl I've never seen before. She was asian, very feminine looking in her pictures (almost too good to be true kind of thing). I sent her a text and told her I wanted to schedule something. She replied very quickly and asked for my race and pic, which I provided. She said I was cute and agreed to schedule with me. I was a bit skeptical if she would actually look like her pics. I went to her place later that night, buzzed up to her apartment, she slowly opened the door and there she was. Looked better in person than her pics, she was wearing lacy lingerie just like in her pics, very feminine body and cute face. She was also very nice, asked me how I was, offered me water, etc. After some small chit chat, she walked me over to the bed and we began making out. She took things very slowly which I really liked, lots of foreplay before she fucked me. As she slid it in for the first time, I grabbed the bottle of poppers I brought and asked if she wanted any (more on this later). She declined and told me it makes her head hurt. I took two big huffs and she began to slowly fuck me. As I lost control over my body, I just stared at her beautiful face as she fucked me harder and harder. After a few minutes when the poppers began to wear off, I asked her if she could cum in my mouth, which she said yes to. She fucked me some more and then said she was about to cum, she pulled out, took the condom off and jammed her medium sized cock down my throat and moaned. I felt the warm cum hit my throat, I didn't let it go down and instead left it in my mouth so I could taste it (kinda just tasted like lube and condoms). Sucked her off for a little bit and swallowed. She then 69'd me and jerked me off while I ate her ass out. Afterwards, I asked her if she was visiting cause I never saw her ad before. She said she was visiting from Thailand and would be here for another couple weeks and then going home. I told her I wanted to see her again before she left and that I'll keep in touch. I didn't know if I was imagining it or what, but I felt some sort of connection with her, I had a feeling she was into me. Ended up meeting her for a 2nd time the following week, pretty much the same experience as the above. The night before she left for Thailand, I texted her again. I asked if she wanted to see me, this time at my place, strictly for fun. I knew this was a long shot because she was visiting strictly to make money. To my surprise, she said she would love to. Later that night, she came over, we shared a bottle of wine and had a very intimate night. Made out longer than usual, we were both buzzed, foreplay under the covers, getting sweaty, etc. Before she started to fuck me, I grabbed my poppers like I usually did, and this time she told me she wanted some. At this point, I knew she had feelings for me because she told me she does not take poppers with clients, so now we are really having NSA fun. We both took a hit, and she fucked me. It was amazing. After we both finished, she told me regretted coming over because she was afraid to catch feelings. I told her it's ok, that we will remain friends and hopefully see each other later. She looked into my eyes with a sad look on her face, seemed like she was waiting for me to propose to her or something. She then cleaned up and we said goodbye and she left. I texted her the next morning telling her to have a safe flight and that I'll miss her, which she reciprocated. Fast forward a year or so later, I see her pics again online and find out shes visiting again. I immediately text her and asked if she remembered me. She did, but her responses were not as ""Friendly"" as before, seemed strictly business. I asked if she wanted to come over, which she said she did but would not be NSA. I agreed anyways, but I went to her place instead. We caught up a bit and then got down to business. It was like our other non-nsa sessions, a bit more kinky as I was not shy this time to ask her for certain fetishes I have (I sucked on her toes, asked her to spit in my mouth, etc). Afterwards, she began texting me very friendly again, asking me how my night was, what I'm doing, etc. We met a couple more times, non-NSA only, and she told me she was going back to Thailand again. This second go-around I felt less and less emotionally attached to her, I think we were both trying to emotionally distance ourselves so we didn't feel sad like the first time. Which I am fine with and is probably the best decision. I texted her one last time before her flight and she responded. I haven't seen her ads in my area since then (6 months ago ish), but if I do, I will definitely reach out to her again."	tsgonewildstories

I Calculated How Much Steve Wrote For Each Album	A while back I did the who wrote what series, and using that info, plus adding up all the seconds of all the parts he helped write I gathered these results: Nursery Cryme: 6:12 (15.7%) Foxtrot: 7:16 (14.2%) SEBTP: 11:00 (20.4%) The Lamb: 12:00 (12.7%) there‚Äôs a big margin of error for this one ATOTT: 7:25 (14.5%) WAW: 9:42 (19.1%) Kinda strange he didn‚Äôt think he got enough on WAW, especially since he has the lead credit on three songs, plus the middle of 11th Earl of Mar. Although when you consider that One For The Vine already exceeds the length of everything Steve wrote, it‚Äôs kinda understandable.	Genesis

Are evictions a thing yet?	I remembered reading that the evictions moratorium expired at the end of April and I did some digging through old news articles which confirmed that the evictions moratorium ended April 26th. Does anyone know if that got extended? Are evictions only being held up by the fact that courts are closed right now? I think the CARES act bans evictions on certain properties through June (estimated to effect about 25% of renters who have federally backed rental agreements or whose landlords used certain federal programs).	rva

Proposal of Additional Metrics	This post is meant to reach the data visualization teams that support Hex. I think it would be helpful to have a time series chart of open stakes. For example, I would like to know how many open stakes exist at 4:00PM ET each day. If we can take that time series and multiply it by the Hex price at 4:00PM each day, then we could see the USD value of all open stakes on a time series basis. Finally, it would also be helpful to see a time series graph with the number of unique addresses with open stakes as of 4:00PM ET, each day. These time series graph that I have proposed mimic some of the key metrics that are used in the insurance industry, such as policies in force and premium in force. Thanks.	HEXcrypto

Got promoted to customer today	I was going to leave early since I wasn‚Äôt feeling good (nauseous, dizzy, sweating) and was working in the meat department and I didn‚Äôt want to be around food and pose a risk to anyone. HR took the opportunity to tell me they were going to end my temporary work with them. I was just kinda in shock as I handed over my badge and vest. No warning or anything. Just ended it right there, which I can understand I guess. But their reasoning was that ‚Äúwe just don‚Äôt need that many people working right now‚Äù yet constantly understaffed and the Walmart‚Äôs in my area are supposedly going on a hiring spree. I was always given the short end of the stick since I was the newbie, and my supervisor was always so passive aggressive to me and HR never communicated with me over important matters. I always felt disrespected and under-appreciated. I went to my car and cried. Now I know that I could only do so much. I tried my very best and always worked hard and got my shit done. Not sorry that I care about my health and my coworker‚Äôs health. While I was sad at first and blamed it on myself, I‚Äôm actually kinda glad that I don‚Äôt work here anymore.

I was naked but covered my upper body with a blanket letting my lower half remain exposed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre smooth now‚Äù he reacted. I simply smiled at him and said ‚Äúwell, I figured if this is gonna be happening a lot, I may as well.‚Äù He asked,‚Äùhow often do you want it?‚Äù I said, ‚Äúanytime I ask for it. Do you agree?‚Äù He said ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù He dipped his finger inside me, tasted me. He leaned toward my face to try for a kiss, I stopped him and pushed his head down between my legs. He played with my freshly shaven, puffy outer lips. The new sensations were amazing (I had never shaved before). He kissed and teased and licked and sucked on me for a good 10 minutes before I was finished, with a few orgasms and very wet sheets. Still in my haze, I said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. He reached up and copped a feel of my breasts then returned to his room. Of course, I still laid there wondering why he hasn‚Äôt tried to fuck me yet. Maybe next time?	SluttyConfessions

Commercial Landlord Refusing to Heat Office	Hi, I'm in England I'm writing this on my parent's behalf. They own and run a domiciliary care company and as a result are very much still working through the lockdown. The place they rent as their office is a really big building with about 65 units. Since lockdown has started the landlord has ceased all cleaning, rubbish collection and heating the building. The biggest problem is the heating as the office is getting really cold we think it's below the 16 degrees minimum that I've read is the legal minimum for a workplace. When the landlord has been asked to turn the heating back on they say it would be too expensive to heat the entire building for just one unit, but we are still paying full rent and, as far as we know, all other tenants are too. Their tenant agreement states that the landlord will provide 'background heat' which they are not doing. They suggested we plug in electric heaters but this has made little difference as the unit is too big. Where do we stand? Is there any way we can get them to heat the building? I've not been able to find any regulations for commercial landlords online. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	LegalAdviceUK
36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar.

Analyzing the clone inhibitor chips	"In TCW S7E11, [the scan](https://imgur.com/50dMgxw) of Rex's brain shows that the clones' inhibitor chips are implanted in the right frontal lobe. This is a very logical place for a device that can suppress individuality and cause violent outbursts. * The right hemisphere of the human brain is responsible for creative thinking, decision making, impulse and motor control. This fits the inhibitor chips' role in suppressing the clones' free will, making them less impulsive, and forcing them to execute Order 66. * Within the right hemisphere, the [right frontal lobe](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/frontal-lobe) controls problem solving, judgment, and personality. It makes sense for the inhibitor chip to be placed here, as it needs to force a clone to abandon individuality, conform to Order 66, and view all Jedi allies as enemies. * Damage to the right frontal lobe can cause antisocial behavior, loss of personality, and dementia. When Tup's inhibitor malfunctions, he ""snaps,"" kills General Tiplar, and lashes out at General Tiplee. Though we know these are the effects of Sidious' brainwashing, his chip's malfunction also likely caused brain damage associated with antisocial behavior. * We also see Order 66 wipe most of the clones' individual personalities. Loyal friends of the Jedi turn on them in seconds; even Rex succumbs, despite trying to fight his indoctrination. If there's a region of the brain to tweak to make this possible, it's the right frontal lobe. * Another note about Rex: when Sidious triggers Order 66, Rex loses control of his left hand muscles and drops his helmet without realizing. If the inhibitor had anything to do with it, then this is medically accurate, since the [right frontal lobe controls muscles in the left side of the body](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318139). Of course, he was also overwhelmed by conflicting loyalties to both Sidious and Ahsoka at the time. * A study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry ([Benson, Cummings, Darby, and Miller, 1997](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=blumer+and+benson+1975&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D850Q_wJYFacJ)) found that patients with frontal-temporal damage were predisposed to committing assault, manslaughter, and other harmful or unlawful behaviors, the exact kind the chips are supposed to inhibit. * Also, at least one patient in that study was arrested for indecent exposure.

Urban Planning YouTube channel	Hi! I am a first year urban planning student in the UK and really want to make a youtube channel that focuses on planning issues both in the UK and globally. Would anyone watch this? And if so, do you have any ideas that could be good for videos? My knowledge isn't amazing atm because I'm still only young but it could be a great way for me to learn new things and pass them on to others! Thoughts?	urbanplanning

New Legendary Hunter Idea	"My friend mentioned to me how the Bald Knobbers where a gang active in Missouri post civil war. Their look and mask is very distinctive and would fit in to Hunt: Showdown very well. Some quotes from the Wikipedia post: The **Bald Knobbers** were a group of vigilantes in the Ozark region of southwest Missouri from 1883 to 1889. They began as a group dedicated to protecting life and property, aiding law enforcement officials in the apprehension of criminals, opposing corruption in local government, and punishing those who violated the social and religious mores of their community. In some places, the vigilantes gained much political influence, occupied key offices, and became effectively the ruling faction in local politics. They made many enemies, however, with whom they had several violent, sometimes fatal, confrontations. In 1886, after gaining national notoriety from their exploits, and embarrassing state leaders, Missouri Governor John S. Marmaduke sent Adjutant General J.C. Jamison to Forsyth to investigate the situation. Upon arrival, although the representative was pleased to see the atmosphere of order that prevailed, he recommended to Kinney that an official dissolution of the Bald Knobbers would be in the best interest of the county. That next day a formal dissolution ceremony was held in the town square where the Bald Knobbers were publicly disbanded, having served their original purpose. It would make sense for the gang members that ""Lost"" their purpose in Missouri to decide to move to Louisiana and start hunting depraved evil monsters in an effort to restore order. They already have the violent tendencies of the other gangs of hunters in the game. With the perverse idea of restoring order to a lawless area. https://preview.redd.it/1jo3hfx275y41.jpg?width=575&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a35c4aaae9c0e98456ad213c5168ae81c940ab7"	HuntShowdown

idea for new druid subclass	so I had idea for a new druid subclass: circle of the swarm. it's a bug themed subclass where you pick a type of swarm from the list and gain specific perks. honeybee: create and enchant honey to give buffs and heal your party. mosquito: poison and annoy opponents while buffing yourself with their blood spider: build webs to hinder opponent movement and get to climb up walls ant: being able to swarm opponents with different ant types that have different effects dung beetle: create balls of dung that gives disadvantage on opponents this subclass is still being created and I'm looking for help on creating it. edit: I'm thinking of letting the druid turn into a swarm as a wild shape	DnD

Pure Madra path benefits	I was thinking about different paths and it got me thinking that so far we haven't see that many benefits of a pure madra path or any particular reason Eithan would choose one. Benefits: * Easy on the channels allowing a lot of madra to be put into techniques * Has a soothing effect on Lindons channels after blackflame * Powerful for nullifying striker techniques Drawbacks: * No ruler technique/weak to ruler techniques * Doesn't have the best enforcer techniques (although Eithan says this Lindons seems pretty good) * Doesn't have much in the way of attacks (Either shatter their core with a striker technique or disrupt them a bit, no inbetween) * No defensive capabilities apart from striker attacks From Uncrowned it seems that the Aurelius clan specialises in storm and lightning based paths matched with their extraordinary sight; Eithan who gives the impression of being a long lost scion from the Aurelius main line seems to be on a weaker path. Obviously most of Lindon's focus has been on blackflame but he would be a shadow of the sacred artist he is if he only had a pure path. While Eithan is a very powerful underlord that seems to be down to his iron body, large core and excellent command over bloodline powers rather than his path at all, arguably he would be a lot more successful with a different path. So it got me thinking that pure madra might be more of a 'late game build' while BlackFlames are a deadly threat at copper maybe Pure madra paths don't start seeing their benefits until Archlord+. The counterpoint being that none of the higher advancements seem too fussed about his path or future advancement. Could be because I'm blatantly wrong or maybe there hasn't been a pure madra sage/herald so people aren't aware.	Iteration110Cradle

Each day that passes I care a little less and one day soon I won‚Äôt even think of you at all. You‚Äôre always so arrogant about your ability to make me fall back in love with you whenever you want.

Rogue Anthropologist	Hey r/3d6!

It'd be great if Blizzard came out and said Allied Races would also be getting new customization options in a patch. Frankly, some of them feel half-finished and need some love and additional options for skin, hair, etc.	For example: * Void Elves desperately need a few less-corrupted options for their skin tones and hairstyles. I'm guessing they could easily borrow some of the new Blood Elf faces coming in 9.0 as well. They'd look awesome with some makeup options s well, like eye shadow around the eyes. * Lightforged Draenei basically look like white ghosts. Their few skin tones and hair colours are so pale and there's very little variety. There might be some symbolism going on there with how the Light washes over everything in the cosmos and makes it all uniform. But they could really use a few options, even if it just comes down to some hair styles and maybe the new rumoured Draenei tails. * Nightborne are still subpar to their NPC counterparts when it should be the other way around if anything. A few Allied Races are really good, like Dark Iron Dwarves. But a lot of them need serious work.	wow
Test This Claim: Outside of the Extremes, Most of Us Write OCs	To contextualise this: my stance is that I do not read fanfic for OCs. I do read OC-centric fics and enjoy them, but this is typically when they explore some theme or aspect of canon I find engaging, or are used to illuminate different aspects of canon characters. Nevertheless, I advance this following set of claims not as something I am deeply convinced about, but as something I have thought somewhat about, and would appreciate hearing more about from others: >\[CLAIM\] Barring extreme cases, most of us, to some degree or other, write OCs. > >\[COROLLARY #1\] A number of us are simply more concerned about marketing our fics as being canon-centric, in one way or another, and not advertising the fact OCs are there. > >\[COROLLARY #2\] There is, perhaps, a fandom or generational divide in terms of advertising OCs in one's fic, which can be chalked down to general attitudes towards OCs. What are OCs? I want to rule out borderline cases, e.g. Random Smuggler in Mos Eisley who gets named exactly twice as a one-line entry in the credits and in the encyclopedia. I do think expanding on these characters is fairly close to creating your OCs, but let's be as strict as possible: an OC is any character that did not exist in any form in canon, whether major or minor. Barring people who truly use nothing more than the canon set of characters, most of us have written at least one fic: minimally, with our equivalent of Random Smuggler in Mos Eisley Who Gets Named In The Credits and Fills The Background, and maximally, as a full-fledged major OC participating in the plot. I'm more confident of the former, weaker claim, of course. But sometimes, we need the OC as a framing device, presenting us the outsider perspective, for instance, or to progress the plot, filling a role that a canon character cannot. If \[CLAIM\] is true, then I think \[COROLLARY #1\] is as well: simply because not all of the fics that meet the conditions of \[CLAIM\] tag themselves as including OCs. Most Academy fics in the Bleach fandom are this way; as are a number of young Anakin fics in Star Wars. \[COROLLARY #2\] I advance as one potential hypothesis to explain \[COROLLARY #1\]: or rather, to explain the difference between fics that do tag for OCs, and those which don't. Other variables which might make a difference - the relative freedom of character tagging on AO3 as compared to FFN, as well as authors conscious of how they want to advertise their fics, and potentially, even authors who don't actually consciously perceive themselves as writing a fic with OCs, and therefore do not tag that way. I find the last possibility the most interesting because it suggests that even this strict definition of OC is unhelpful. We mean something else - or at least, some of fandom means something else by the term 'OC fic.' I'm then interested in whether they mean the same things as the rest of fandom, with the difference in use and attitude coming from value judgements, or whether the disagreement is in part because no one means the same thing at all. Thoughts? (I blame lockdown fwiw.)	FanFiction

Also I'm 31 and female, would I struggle to get a job in such a male dominated career? My dad is an engineer, and also knows a lot about cars and I enjoy learning from him and going to vintage car shows and factories.	MechanicAdvice

Mike Lindell, My Pillow = scumbag	I knew the guy was crazy since he's friends with Trump but I just saw the most ridiculous add. He starts talking about his memoir and how he uses math to prove God is real. He goes on to talk about how coincidences just have to be the work of God and that he thinks his book will give people hope during the pandemic. It's so scummy to use the pandemic to sell merch but I shouldn't be surprised. The weirdest part was he didn't even provide any info on how to buy the book its like he just came on to say hey I wrote a book, God is great, goodbye.	atheism

[HELP] Mixing Two Different Dog Foods	"Hello! My partner and I just got an adorable Pekingese/Pomeranian dog. We have only had him for about 4 days as of today and for the past couple of days have been struggling to get him to eat small kibble. At first he ate the dry kibble mixed with the wet food. We thought, ""oh good he is eating the dry food too!"" The next day we went out and bought an additional bag of that food to have on hand. Low and behold the rest of the day and the next he did not want to eat any of the dry kibble and when we mixed the dry and wet he only ate the wet portion. We were concerned so we went and bought a small bag of another dog food which he seems to enjoy so far. This brings us to today where he ate the dry kibble just fine, but not even two hours later he threw it all up. Of course this concerns us so I have a few questions: do we feed him again after he threw up? If it's the fact that we switched dog foods so quickly is it okay to mix the old wet food with the new dry food? After we make the change to this new kibble is it okay to still give him the wet dog food on occasion? For reference: old dry dog food was Science Diet, wet dog food is Science Diet, new dry dog food is Raw Instinct."	dogs

New Rule- No snarking on abuse victims!	"Hi hi! Sorry I've been a bit out of office for a minute- I've been ill and taking some time away from my computer. I've added a new rule as its come to my attention that there's been some troublesome posts that have made some users uncomfortable- and that's not what we're about here. I'm a bit bummed this needs to be spelled out, but here is the new rule: **No Snarking On Abuse Victims** > The essence of a ""trad fem"" is a woman who posts sexist, racist, and nationalist garbage of her own volition. > Posts of ""trad fems"" in obvious abusive situations, or those in which they may not be acting or speaking out of their own volition will be removed. This can be a tricky distinction, so please use your best judgement. Reported posts will be reviewed and removed if necessary. This rule is a work in progress, so let me know if you want me to add or remove anything. I think this rule should be pretty self explanatory, but I'm always open to suggestions :) Also if you think it's chill to snark on women being abused, you can leave. Go to a different snark community please."	Tradfemsnark

How do I stop being clingy during quarantine	So hopefully I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing this but it has recently dawned upon me how needy and clingy I have become during quarantine. I realised this when my sister pointed out how I was checking my phone like every 5-10 minutes (I was checking for replies back to texts) and it sucks cause I‚Äôm not always like this but now I‚Äôm forced inside and can‚Äôt go out and socialise its kind of driving me nuts how I have no one to talk to I‚Äôve tried learning new skills and done a lot of yard work to keep my mind occupied but it still does not distract me from checking my phone or trying to talk to people . Between having to revise for exams and being locked up in here my neediness starts to show when I‚Äôm texting people back almost instantly when they take hours to get to me (which again isn‚Äôt something I normally do) and it‚Äôs putting people off from talking to me Is there anything else I can do to stop being so needy and stop looking for validation from others when they text me , help	socialskills

Was the Ace of Spades made by Tex Mechanica?	The Tex Mechanica foundry has made a few hand cannons, one of which is the [Silvered Maverick Mk. 41](https://destinypedia.com/Silvered_Maverick_Mk._41), a rare D1 hand cannon. I also suspect the legendary [Red Hand IX](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Hand_IX) (D1), the rare [Azimuth DSU](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Azimuth_DSu), and the uncommon [Mos Ultima II](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Mos_Ultima_II) (D2) to also have been made by them. If you've seen these hand cannons, you can't deny that they share -almost- the same frame as the Ace. This led me to believe that Cayde-6 had it custom-made, as it is mentioned in the Ace of Spades [Grimoire card](https://ishtar-collective.net/cards/ace-of-spades?highlight=ace+of+spades). P.S: for further context, here's this [lore entry.](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/ancient-apocalypse-greaves?highlight=tex+mechanica)	DestinyLore
John says he liked other Paul compositions (November 1973)	"All too often I see trashy articles claiming that the only McCartney number Lennon had any respect for was Here, There and Everywhere. In an interview with Chris Charlesworth (originally published in Melody Maker on 3rd November 1973) to promote Mind Games, Lennon's states; ""I have a favourite of Paul's... Of Paul's I like 'Here, There and Everywhere'... Of course I still like 'Eleanor Rigby', and another was 'For No One.'"" Bet this isn't even the only example. All I want is the truth."	beatles

Im at the highest weight Ive ever been	I hate quarantine	teenagers
She is proud of weight loss	I think she knows what she‚Äôs going for. if she promotes anorexia, then this is her long-standing dream of how to look. She does not want to see changes in her body when she is gaining weight. So she has her own ideal of thinness (thinspiration). The fact that she returned to her appearance as in a Kairi video means that she has not yet achieved her ideal. She wants to be much thinner than she is now. Maybe her family dissuaded her from this, but she ignores them. So when Jaclyn forced her into treatment, her mother reacted so sharply. Because she loves her daughter and does whatever she asks, may she be sick	EUGENIACOONEY
My UFO sighting	I along with 3 friends 1 of whom an active duty Sgt in the Marines at the time, saw a UFO approximately 10 miles north west of Kerns Texas in 1995 around midnight on Dec 26...these friends & I go hunting EVERY year at this SAME spot multiple times every year but this trip during Christmas holidays is special & we all 4 make time to get together an go ...we all grew up together and usually spent several weeks during summer break at my friends family's ranch which is just about a mile east from the land....its a 200 plus acre piece of property in the Trinity river bottoms ...the property is used for cattle grazing & bailing hay with about 50 acres of pasture an another 150 acres of hard woods & brier thickets which is GREAT hunting...it typically has around 40-45 cattle on it at any given time and is owned by 1 of the guys family...as I mentioned we have been there MANY times before and after this 'event' and NEVER seen ANYTHING like what we saw that night....there is 1 stock pond which is right on the edge of the pasture & where the woods & thicket begins....we all met up & got a late start leaving Dallas due to family holiday obligations but we arrived around 11-11:30pm and began setting up camp on the levee of the pond which is where we always camp because its the highest spot on the property and its proximity to the area we hunt \[the woods & thicket leading to the Trinity river. I was trying to start a camp fire and had the headlights of the truck on, pointed at the area where I was building the fire...the fire was hard to get lit because there was a layer of frost on everything but I managed to finally get it lit and was about to turn off the headlights when I started to notice that the light from fire & the headlights was becoming washed out by another light coming from behind me \[it gradually became bright as daytime\] ....I stood up an turned around to see WTF & my 3 friends were standing together staring at this HUGE ball of light \[VERY bright reddish/orange \] rising above the tops of the trees approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile away ....I stepped away from the fire & up to where my friends were standing \[we were looking south\] ...I asked my buddy who is a Marine \[already knowing the answer\] if that was a flare ....he said ''NO FUCKIN WAY''.....it was to bright & WAY to large and wasn't flickering or burning or MOVING like a flare.....it was a LARGE solid round ball of light ....It rose straight up so far \[around 100 feet from the tree tops\] & stopped for maybe 15-20 seconds then began moving east slowly ....after moving approx. 200-300 yards it stopped briefly and changed altitude by dropping at about a 45 degree angle, paused again briefly before an shot off like a bullet at incredible speed...we were NOT drunk \[YET\] nor were ANY of us on any kind of drugs Since then I have researched an found out that there have been MULTIPLE documented reports / sightings of \[unexplained\] lights in the sky around Kerns Tx over the years before and since even sightings of what was described as a fleet of lights ! A few moths later \[after our encounter\] I was there with my friend & his family on the same property helping with mowing and bailing hay \[like EVERY year\] and we found 2 dead cattle both were in pretty bad state of decay \[in Texas heat it doesnt tale long for something like that to go pretty fast\] but you could tell they died around the same time & there was no obvious reason for the deaths,no other cattle were unhealthy or injured ! There was NO sound or heat that I could tell...it was a REALLY cold night so I think if it were putting off any heat that we would have felt it but there was nothing ...the property is FAR from ANY big city light pollution & when there is no moon it is REALLY dark...you can see the stars & even the milky way ....that night in particular was 1 of those kinda nights ...it was clear ...no clouds at all ...it was dark AF...I remember this part distinctly because when we got there my buddies & I had to search around to get wood for the camp fire and we didnt have flashlights so we were just using the headlights from the truck !

It is just as hard for women to get a man's attention as is it for men to get a woman's attention.	"I don't know why men have this idea in their heads, seemingly across the board, that it's easy for women to get attention from men. Not every woman is conventionally attractive, especially by today's standards, and not every woman is extremely extroverted and talkative. It irks me when I see men making this statement because I have always been undesirable in the environment I grew up in, through no choice of my own, and it's really not as easy as ""put yourself out there!"" and ""you're a girl, someone will approach you eventually"" for some of us. Also, men love to say that women can be extremely rude when rejecting a man, which is true and I'm not trying to diminish those experiences. But I have had guys laugh in my face and make cruel jokes behind my back about how I looked and who I was just because I expressed the slightest bit of interest in them. Most men are literally only kind to women that they are attracted to, even on a friendship level! The women I know don't do that. We just don't. Bottom line, everyone - especially people who aren't ""attractive"" or ""talkative"" by today's standards has trouble getting a date, and maybe men shouldn't dish it out if they can't take it."	unpopularopinion

19M - I just lost my best friend (and my only friend). I'm now extremely lonely and depressed. Looking to find new people and make new friends!	"19M here! As the title says, I just lost a friend this morning and I'm completely heart broken. We both met online around 6 months ago, shared numbers and became really good friends! I don't have any other friends, he was my only friend till today and he was my best friend! Today he messaged me saying that he's staying away from social media to focus on his career and he's not gonna be able to talk to me for an entire year until he finishes his studies. I respected his choice, told him that I'll support him always and wished him luck and success and said goodbye. Although I'm really happy for him, I still feel really bad and heartbroken that I lost a friend. My friend meter went from 1Ô∏è‚É£ to 0Ô∏è‚É£. Now I'm lonely and have absolutely nobody to talk to, so I made this new account on reddit in hope of finding new friends! Now I'm not trying to find a replacement (he is irreplaceable), I'm also not here looking for sympathy, I'm just trying to talk to new people and make new friends, and I know you're a great person, so LET'S BE FRIENDS!! About myself : I'm really scared to make new friends, the main reason is that they'll leave me. I've had friends who have engaged me in conversation for an entire day and vanished the next day. I mean, being friends for one day... Is it even a thing? I really don't know, please educate me if it is. Now, the thing is, when I become friends with somebody, I start to really like them (not in a creepy way) and I form a special kind of ""friendship bond"" with them, and if they break that bond all of a sudden and leave me, it's gonna really hurt, so I'm trying to look for a friend who won't ghost me after a day or a week. Now I would really like to be honest with you all, so I'll tell you this beforehand just if that's something you'd want to know about me before being my friend. I'm suffering from depression, so I'm not really an expert in having great conversations. I'm sure I'll be really awkward at first, but I promise to try my best and make my best attempts in having a decent conversation. I might not make you laugh, I might be a little awkward, but I'll be the most loyal person in your life! (Second most loyal if you have a pet in your life already). Once we're friends, I'm always going to be there for you no matter what and I'm never going to leave you! I mean, unless you push me and run away of course (oh yeah, I forgot to mention, I sometimes make bad jokes). So I've said everything about me, now I'm looking to find new people and make new friends! Now I've heard from many people in this subreddit that I would get more friends if I was a girl, but I'm not, so I might get less responses, but I'm still going to try! No matter who you are, from which country you are, male or female, please DM me without thinking twice! Who knows, we might become really great friends! I love you and I want to be friends with you! If you read this till the end (or even if you didn't) -- HAVE A NICE DAY !! YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL PERSON !!"	Needafriend

I (30f) visited a sleazy sex club on my lunch break last summer and had an incredible time	Last summer, I was a cooped up *housewife (committed relationship but I still work) and I was desperate for good cock. I decided to look up glory holes (sorry lol) but it felt dangerous. I saw a couple in reviews for sex shops and visited them but the vibe wasn‚Äôt right. I saw someone mention having a good time at a sex club on the west side of town. I researched it for weeks and everything seemed legit, but they were only open at night. I wanted to do everything in my power to stay safe and going at night wasn‚Äôt happening. I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck one day when I saw their daily special on the upcoming Friday was a Nooner session from 12pm - 5pm! I bought slutty panties and pasties to really get my stripper out. I made up my mind to go and told my boss I had a doctors appointment that Friday that might run long. As I drove over, my heart was pounding. I felt curious about what it would look like and about the bad reviews online, but I knew that only angry people leave reviews typically. I called ahead and asked if it was busy, and she said there were a few couples and single men still there and that it was winding down from earlier. When I saw the building and the small sign on the door, I was nervous and excited. I pulled up and parked with my heart beating through my chest, looking at the ten or so cars. While gathering courage, a guy pulled up next to me and hit his car door on my car lightly when he got out - we smiled and it was kind, and I didn‚Äôt feel judged or creeped out for being there like I thought I would. I rolled down my window to tell him it‚Äôs okay; he was a younger and slender guy with very pretty eyes and a smile. He asked me if I was going inside, and I hesitated. I had been planning on just driving away, but the friendliness and respect of this patron made me feel much more relaxed. I smiled and told him I‚Äôd be in soon after I relaxed. I wondered if that was true. I decided to just do it. I was nervous and confused at first, but the reception area was kind. They waved me in and I was flocked immediately by several men that I chose someone new from; an older guy with incredible salt and pepper hair. Introductions were made and I met Rene officially, a handsome older man who was well dressed worn a thick European accent. we made small talk about me being a first timer. He asked about my job and perked up when I said I was an engineer. He told me about the feeling he got building planes as an aviation engineer and that a plane he designed was taking off today. He asked if I‚Äôd like company - of course, I told him. We sat at the table and chairs for awhile and he told me about traveling to Boise for business, and I told him about San Francisco. We shared traveling woes and laughed. I asked him about the club and whether he came there often, and we discussed the different rooms and what they‚Äôre generally used for. I asked about the rules and etiquette, and he said anyone could take anything off and show as much as they want, gesturing to the naked man playing pool behind us. I told him it was difficult to hear him and get to know him and asked if there was a couch in another room where we could sit closer. He suggested a private room upstairs and told me that they‚Äôre cleaned vigorously and have fresh sheets down every time. I had seen on the reviews that the rooms were cute, so I told him sure - I‚Äôd love that. We were followed upstairs to the rooms by the attendant and a single man, and we walked by rooms that were being cleaned. He told me the room at the end was great; I followed. The door opened to an incredible room with a red light with mirrored walls and ceiling. The single male that followed us asked if we wanted company, and Rene answered no for us and we laughed, shutting the door slightly. He asked where I‚Äôd like to sit, the chairs or the bed, and I opted for the bed. He was a grey fox and smelled like expensive body wash and beard oil when I sat next to him. He rubbed my back and I put my things on the table while the attendant brought a condom, shutting the door after her. After chatting a bit more, I took my vest off and he smiled and said that I should take my shirt off, too. I smiled and sat back down, and he leaned in to kiss me. He tasted extremely fresh and smelled wonderful, so I had high hopes for his hygiene. I smiled and told him I‚Äôd been waiting to show off my pasties to someone and took off my shirt; with no bra, my huge tits bounced out and revealed my new lightning bolt pasties. He loved them and immediately started playing with my tits; I could see my nipples poking out hard under the pasties. After making out and kissing a bit, he removed his shirt and said he was overdressed. He still had his incredibly nice jeans, belt, and chuck Taylor‚Äôs on - so cute! We made out again and I said I was going to take my shorts off to show him something else, standing up and shimmying out of my vintage high waist shorts. I was wearing black lace panties with blue tie-up sides that were crotchless, but he couldn‚Äôt see that part yet. His eyes ate me up and he laid me back on the bed to admire me in the red light before stripping to his cute European boxer briefs. He fondled me and played with me through my panties when he discovered they were crotchless. He slid his boxers off and tossed them down while pushing me up on the bed gently and spreading my legs, still with my undies on. He spread my legs wide and ate me out gently while I watched my tits and my cute pasties in the mirror ceiling. He was incredibly skillful and had me near orgasm several times, which I kept pulling away from to save it. I told him he felt incredible and he pushed both of my legs up, exposing my pussy more and continued to eat. I asked what I could do to thank him and he gently pushed back on my legs to spread me wider and expose my freshly shaven asshole. He licked a couple of times under my pussy to gauge interest and I moaned to him that he felt amazing. His tongue dove down around my asshole and licked me slowly and deeply, gently tongueing my asshole and loosening me up. He worked his tongue inside my hole and grabbed my thick legs to pull my ass around his tongue, sliding it in to extend as far as it would go while keeping a thumb on my clit. After an incredible amount of time, I started bucking my hips and he returned to my pussy, suckling on my clit and pushing a finger in, then a second one. He fingered me deeply and slow at first, then upped the intensity to a deep vigorous finger fuck that had me squirming. I pulled away and laughed and told him he was amazing at that and that I wanted to repay him. He crawled on the bed next to me and showed me his cock, a good 7 inch thick cock that was neatly groomed and smelled like his body wash and fresh laundry. He pulled off my pasties and nibbled and sucked on my nipples gently, murmuring ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck‚Äù as he complimented my big tits and how perky and young they felt. I licked his tip and tasted him, slowly working him with my mouth until I got down to the base when he moaned loud and sent chills through me. I pushed my tongue down and licked hard for a while, working his shaft with my hand and smiling with his cock in my mouth while he watched my exposed ass and pussy through my panties in the mirror. He pulled out and told me to lick, which I did, smiling and giving him long, loving licks up and down his big cock. He groaned and told me how hot I was and kept muttering ‚Äúfuck‚Äù to himself. He gently held my head still and fucked my mouth slowly, then said he wanted to see and laid down on the bed. He spread his legs and I crawled between them smiling, locking his eyes while I started to suck on his tip. I worked him into my throat and let him rub his cock around deep past my gag reflex as he moaned. I slid him out and licked him again with eye contact and his body stared to shake gently. As I pulled my head up, he looked up at me desperately and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget my balls‚Äù and I smiled and dove back in, licking and sucking his balls while giggling at him. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I almost forgot‚Äù I said while he groaned deeply and put his head back. ‚ÄúThis is good stress relief right?‚Äù I asked him teasingly. He agreed, and I sat up on my knees. ‚ÄúI have 30 minutes before I have to get back to work, but I‚Äôm here and yours for the entire time‚Äù I whispered in his ear, making out with him and rubbing his cock. He pouted and whined and said okay, and asked me then to get on my knees and in the doggy position. He spread my ass cheeks wide and ate my pussy while smacking my big ass and grabbing onto my legs to pull me deeper onto his face and tongue. He slid his fingers into me again and moved his tongue to my exposed ass, tongue fucking me while rubbing my g-spot. I moaned and told him he was incredible as he moved his thumb to my asshole. He pushed his thumb against my hole and then inside of it, gripping me with two fingers in my pussy and his thumb deep in my ass. I couldn‚Äôt believe this is how he wanted to spend his 30 minutes, but I was in bliss. He used his other hand to rub my clit and smiled down at my body as I watched him through my hair, face down on the bed. I let him eat his fill and watched his cock get even bigger and thicker in the mirror as he took the hand on my clit and moved it to work his cock. He pulled up and got into position behind me, smacking my ass hard and asking me if I was ready for the condom. I sat up on my knees and said yes please and smiled at him. He shook his head and smiled in disbelief when I told him he was hot, and asked how old I was. When I told him, his eyebrows shot up and he said he was almost 30 years older than me and that i was younger than his daughter. I laughed and wiggled my ass at him, and he slid my panties off. He grabbed the condom and got it ready to roll on, then motioned with his cock to please suck a little more. I grinned and crawled over to him, sucking him slow and steady while he moaned every time he felt my tongue. I pulled back and he put the condom on. I asked where he wanted me and in what position, and he told me he already found his favorite and asked me to offer up to him in doggy style. I spread my legs and he got behind me, rubbing his cock on me and asking me to spread my legs more (I‚Äôm tall), plunging into me and moaning ‚Äúyes, perfect, right there‚Äù as he started fucking me. He slapped my ass hard and I pulled my hair up and held it as I was facedown, watching us in the mirror as he fucked all his stress from work into me and stretched out my pussy. I grabbed the sheets and pushed back into him, letting him grip my hips and fuck me deep while he moaned and told me how hot and perfect I was. I moaned as he grabbed my leg and pushed a finger inside my ass while fucking me, expanding it to two fingers when my moans quickened. He pulled his fingers out and gripped my hips, fucking me faster and faster until he was pounding my pussy open and gaped. I watched him in the mirror as he started arching his back, feeling his fingers dig into my hips and his grip tighten. I giggled and looked at him in the mirror and shook my ass while he fucked me and said ‚Äúgimme‚Äù to him smiling, and he lost it - he screamed and groaned so hard I knew every other room heard it, pounding into me with his face up toward the red light and his eyes closed. He took a total of 10 pumps to finish cumming, pushing into me deep and laughing and smiling with the release. I told him he felt amazing and he was so hot to watch as he bobbed the cum filled condom into me with his cock, softer but still big enough and thick enough to stay in me. He stayed there massaging my pussy with his worn out cock in me for another minute or so, rubbing my ass and back gently and squeezing my shoulders, murmuring to me how beautiful I was and how good I felt. I could tell he didn‚Äôt want to pull out; I spread my legs and rubbed his cock from the inside with a good kegel massage while he rode his bliss and came down softly. He pulled out and grabbed us two fresh towels, smiling and telling me I was crazy to keep saying how hot he was, and that he was hot thirty years ago. I laughed and told him that I had just gotten good proof that he still had it, and he laughed hard - no, still works, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm aiming for! He was incredibly shy and sweet. I got dressed and he asked me about what college was like and said he hoped I had a good time with him - I hugged him and told him it was incredible. He showed me videos of his plane taking off and the dashboards and systems that he had designed on his phone, and we chatted about Russia because it‚Äôs the only place that doesn‚Äôt have an aerial map released for the terrain software - it was fascinating. We grabbed our stuff and he got out a generous tip for the bartender as she also cleans the rooms. We headed downstairs past the other patrons smiling, and I enjoyed the looks and eyes on my big tits bouncing in my shirt without a bra, nipples hard and poking through the fabric without my pasties. We walked outside and I hugged him and he said he really hopes it was enjoyable and that he‚Äôd love to see me again - I hugged him back closely and told him definitely if I‚Äôm there again. I headed back to my car for a much needed break and a truck pulled up next to me as I was about to back up. It was a cute guy with a construction vest on that was checking me out. I rolled down my window and greeted him, feeling bold from the great time I‚Äôd just had. He smiled and asked, a lot of guys for you? And I said just one. we chatted about how it wasn‚Äôt busy anymore and he begged and joked for me to come inside, but I told him I only had 5 minutes before I leave to work. He told me he only goes to jerk off or get hand jobs and smiled at me, asking if I want him to give me something so I could spend my 5 minutes with him. I teased and said he‚Äôs fast, and he said yes very. I said no, because I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was against the rules, and offered to flash him from my car instead. I pulled out my tits and played with them for him as he unzipped his jeans and showed me his huge cock that was visibly pulsing without him working it. I smiled and played with my tits and put on a show for him through the window as he jerked his cock hard for me, letting me watch but being careful to hide from the people walking around by their cars. I jiggled and bounced them around and said I have to go, and he shook my hand and said his name was Alejandro and begged to know when I‚Äôd be back. I smiled and said it looks like Friday is my day :) I drove away wet and satisfied with how well-received and respected I was, and how incredibly attractive I felt. It felt great and was an amazing confidence boost. I have always wanted to be fucked in a mirrored room and love red light - I had a 10/10 time! Happy to answer any questions, one of the happiest days of my life	SluttyConfessions
Pronunciation difference between „Åë„ÅÑ„Åç and „Åë„Åà„Åç?	First of all, I know that ‚Äúkeeki‚Äù should be spelled in Katakana. But, my Japanese skills are only 3 days old, so I am still only on the Hiragana script. I was learning the character ‚Äúke‚Äù („Åë) and stumbled upon two words- business and cake. Is there are difference in pronunciation between the two? Because I can‚Äôt hear it. Or is the only difference that ‚Äúcake‚Äù is spelled in Katakana due to being an imported word?	japanese
Unmatching girls who reply with one sentence responses or ghost me has never felt so good!	So I recently picked up dating again after a 3 year hiatus to focus on myself and my career (went through a rough patch in life) as soon as I came back COVID hit so I got a little unlucky but after 3 years off I really developed a strong mind and ability to not be phased by rejection. Also I've really changed my whole outlook on how I approach women, I have had several matches on Hinge who would reply with one sentence after I tried to get a meaningful conversation going and put alot of effort into each reply (sometimes 1-3 small paragraphs), and I have felt no remorse just straight up unmatching them I feel so free! I used to be all worrisome like this girl doesn't like me or why isn't she responding. Lesson learned it's not worth your time waiting for someone who just doesn't care, keep on going there is for sure someone out there who will put effort into the conversation and will be very genuine, dont let it get you down!	dating

Passed A+ Core 1 (5 minutes ago) Online!	Just passed the Core 1 (1001) and couldn't be happier! :D Scored a total of 775. I have no prior IT experience, but quite tech savvy. Used Prof. Messers videos and Mike Myers books, and would say that Mike Myers saved my ass due to detailed info on configuration. Prof. Messer covers a lot, but not everything that was asked, so I would suggest using more than one type of source material. Tip to everyone taking it at home: 1. Don't drink too much water/coffee prior / Go to the toilet before (I was contemplating pissing myself the last 30 min and I even went right before starting) 2. Don't cover your mouth or read questions out loud (the proctor will tell you so) 3. Flag and skip (I cannot stress this enough, I most likely got two questions correct due to there being correlating information)	CompTIA

Quarantine has been PRODUCTIVE! 4 WORKS ON WATTPAD	For over 20 years I've written works without compiling them into one place.During quarantine I've put my written works together and have now 4 works (2 complete) going on Wattpad with new works being updated DAILY as I still have tons to go through. My writing goal has always been working within my own created Universe. My writing revolves around dark fantasy and neo-noir elements that I have molded into a world that highlights the struggles between the Fallen and Divine. I am also lucky to have the very talented Vanessa Trueba [https://www.instagram.com/nessa\_ninona/](https://www.instagram.com/nessa_ninona/) lending her talents for my Revelations series with chapters from Book III finally being uploaded after a 7 year hiatus.

AOOs through an ally	Simple and quick question: Can I attack enemies that provoke aoo if there's an ally between them and me, if I have enough reach to hit them? I ask this because in the manual, they say that you can't hit them if they have cover: Cover and Attacks of Opportunity You can‚Äôt execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you. However, creatures give SOFT cover to other creatures: Soft Cover Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Stealth check So I need to have [Phalanx Formation](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/phalanx-formation-combat/) to attack them with an aoo?

The Pain of being a Hammer Main (Poem+partial serious discussion topic)	Oh hammer, you sweet pain Why have I ever made you my main &#x200B; Every strike and every swing Massive damage you will bring &#x200B; I rumble and tumble And aim for the face Then watch every monster crumble Under you sweet embrace &#x200B; But how I suffer so For every other weapon I try It just feels too slow &#x200B; No other weapon does damage like you do Tried the sword and board But the damage didn't follow through &#x200B; Bow, Bowgun, Dual blades Every one of them suffers the same fate For I have yet found A weapon so efficient to equate \--------------------------------------------------------------- &#x200B; Alright, now for something serious. I'm wondering if other people have this problem, mainly hammer (and probably GS) mains. Every other weapon feels slow compared to the hammer and I find it really difficult to get used to new weapons. And Im not meaning slow as in using it, but in dealing damage. I can take down a monster in 20 min in terms of damage where it just takes longer with any other weapon. Lot more dodging etc going on. And this is not too serious, I understand if I practice enough I can do the same damage with all weapons, but the hammer just makes the switch difficult. &#x200B; So the question, do other people have this problem?

New Legendary Hunter Idea	"My friend mentioned to me how the Bald Knobbers where a gang active in Missouri post civil war. Their look and mask is very distinctive and would fit in to Hunt: Showdown very well. Some quotes from the Wikipedia post: The **Bald Knobbers** were a group of vigilantes in the Ozark region of southwest Missouri from 1883 to 1889. They began as a group dedicated to protecting life and property, aiding law enforcement officials in the apprehension of criminals, opposing corruption in local government, and punishing those who violated the social and religious mores of their community. In some places, the vigilantes gained much political influence, occupied key offices, and became effectively the ruling faction in local politics. They made many enemies, however, with whom they had several violent, sometimes fatal, confrontations. In 1886, after gaining national notoriety from their exploits, and embarrassing state leaders, Missouri Governor John S. Marmaduke sent Adjutant General J.C. Jamison to Forsyth to investigate the situation. Upon arrival, although the representative was pleased to see the atmosphere of order that prevailed, he recommended to Kinney that an official dissolution of the Bald Knobbers would be in the best interest of the county. That next day a formal dissolution ceremony was held in the town square where the Bald Knobbers were publicly disbanded, having served their original purpose. It would make sense for the gang members that ""Lost"" their purpose in Missouri to decide to move to Louisiana and start hunting depraved evil monsters in an effort to restore order. They already have the violent tendencies of the other gangs of hunters in the game. With the perverse idea of restoring order to a lawless area. https://preview.redd.it/1jo3hfx275y41.jpg?width=575&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a35c4aaae9c0e98456ad213c5168ae81c940ab7"	HuntShowdown

Emergent Gameplay concept: Hunt PC pirates	"In other free-form MMOs with open PVP I have often been a pirate or a ganker. But, honestly I had a shower thought. The nature of the FSD interface allows you to perceive other player interactions from a distance without being noticed. The hunt and ""good karma"" from saving people from pirates, i.e. gank the pirate would be a good serotonin boost, and interesting ""end game"" content. Play Space Cop. But I've never been ganked in Elite. I hear about it have done it, but never been victim. How common is it? And where could I go to help save some new pilot from certain doom? But I also see flaws here, Elite is BIG. Most miners play in solo. And I haven't ever even been harassed so how common is pirating, really? I've read about it quite a lot though, so it must exist, ya?"	EliteDangerous
Day 1 solo has been a success! (So far)	My husband went back to work today. 6.5 weeks with us all home, isolating together, and getting to know little man. The last few days have been a nightmare, not sure if it was a growth spurt or a leap or whatever but my calm little guy has been nothing but fussy. That coupled with the stress of hubs going back to work as the province reopens from the Pandemic, as We live in the second hardest hit province in Canada, so not exactly super excited as he works in people's homes for a living. I really wanted him to not go. I was dreading today, how was I going to do it alone? How are we going to stay healthy with him going back to work? But so far so good. Had a quiet morning of giggles and smiles, even managed to get the dog walked, followed by little man putting himself down for a nap. Hubs called to fill me in on the health and safety measures his boss has provided and sounds like he's gone over board which is fine by me. It's not ideal but I definitely feel less anxious than I did. We got this! Being a new parent in a pandemic isn't ideal but we'll get through this! Somehow I am going to keep this kid happy for 8 hours a day, 5-6 days a week and we're all going to stay healthy üòä. Just needed somewhere to share that I'm proud of my family and my new found Mom abilities. And absolute Worst case Ontario my MIL has been isolating like a champ and would happily walk the 20 minutes in the snow to finally meet her Grandbaby to help me out.	NewParents
High rise condo changes effects of milk frother	For 2 years I lived on the 63rd floor of a building and my Nespresso milk frother worked so poorly, with any type of milk. I have now moved to the 20th floor of a building on the same Canadian city and cannot believe how differently the milk frother works! Are there any scientific minds out there that could provide some explanation as to what is going on? Annoyingly, I actually replaced my frother a year ago because I thought it was broken. I eventually thought it was just a bad product!	nespresso

Check out the site for more LoR guides! **First wins of the day** * First 3 wins of the day give 400, 200, 100 EXP **PvP ‚Äî unlimited wins, max 10 losses** * Each win gives 200 EXP, no limit * Losses 1-4 give 100 EXP * Losses 5-10 give 50 EXP * Losses 11+ give 0 EXP **Friend Challenges ‚Äî first 5 wins or losses** * First 5 wins give 200 EXP * First 5 losses give 100 EXP * More than 5+ wins or losses give 0 EXP **AI ‚Äî unlimited wins, first 10 losses** * Wins 1-4 give 100 EXP * Wins 5-10 give 75 EXP * Wins 11+ give 50 EXP * Losses 1-4 give 50 EXP * Losses 5-10 give 25 EXP * Losses 11+ give 0 EXP With this knowledge, here's a checklist of what you might want to accomplish daily to max out on the bonus daily EXP: 1. Try to reroll for 1,500 EXP quests, or quests that favor your decks 2. Trade 5 wins and 5 losses with a Friend while trying to help each other clear daily quests 3. Surrender 10 AI matches 4. Win at least 3 PVP matches 5. Lose or Surrender 10 PVP matches 6. Win 10 AI matches 7. Do Expeditions if available At this point, you can go on and continue playing more PVP matches and each win will give you 200 EXP with no cap. Oh and daily quests take effect on AI or friend matches too even if you surrender. Hope this helps! And would love to hear your thoughts and tips/tricks.	LegendsOfRuneterra

My Theory About What Lies Within Sandy Cheeks Cock	source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SandyCheeksCockVore/comments/gftb13/my\_theory\_about\_what\_lies\_within\_sandy\_cheeks\_cock/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandyCheeksCockVore/comments/gftb13/my_theory_about_what_lies_within_sandy_cheeks_cock/) This question really got me thinking critically about SandyCheeksCockVore. After hours of research I must say I have hit a dead end. It is truly a mystery what lies within the cock of Sandy Cheeks. Think of it as a sort of like a black hole, no one knows what's on the other side. Is the Sandy Cheeks in our universe just a mere doorway into another whole dimension of Sandy Cheeks Cock Vore? We may never know. All we know is that Sandy Cheeks is a higher being (likely from another plateau of existence) of unprecedented strength. All of those who attempted to enter the vacuum have never returned. The SCP foundation has attempted to subjugate her to little avail. All we can do is worship Sandy Cheeks, and her massive cock. Hopefully we'll get answers one day...	copypasta
Summaries in studying are useless	I see so many, in fact everyone making little ‚Äúsummary notes‚Äù of whatever they are studying in uni as a way of studying the material. My question is, why? Unless you‚Äôre a crammer who doesn‚Äôt care about learning but only purpose of learning is to pass grades, then yea fair enough but I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre at uni because you care about what you learn ? Otherwise why would u be paying to go to uni in the first place right ? So if you care so much about learning, instead of memorising then why don‚Äôt you just learn the entire content and understand it? That way, you don‚Äôt have to memorise anything ; it‚Äôs just recalling from what‚Äôs part of your knowledge now	unpopularopinion

ELI5: How does cosmic inflation increase distances and not just the size of objects?	I don't understand why cosmic inflation results in increasing distances between celestial bodies. If it's a phenomenon that affects all space, because *space itself* is being blown up, shouldn't it also mean that for example the distance between the atoms that make up our bodies, and our telescopes, and the entire earth, would increase too? And if everything gets inflated equally, why would we even notice a difference? Like, if I zoom in on a picture, the *relative* distances between objects doesn't change because everything is magnified equally. But cosmic inflation is explained as *just* the distances increasing while the objects themselves remain unaffected, apparently? Like, where is the limit drawn? Does the distance between earth and moon increase? Earth and sun? Our solar system to others?	explainlikeimfive
Weird thing about New Normal	I think a lot of us already know that you can find a bunch of different characters or things in the background of New Normal that have been in his previous videos, for example at the end of the music video you can find a man sitting on a chair, this is almost the exact same person/thing sitting on a chair in the song whisper also by jack stauber. My question is, why did he do this. There must be a reason behind it because i doubt he would do this for no reason. From what i know he has never done this before. Let me know what you guys think.	jackstauber

18 [F4M] be my (boy) friend? incoming freshie LF long-term college friend	So I came across this sub and was curious so I wanted to give it a try. Wala ako sa pinas rn but I will be once everything‚Äôs settled for college, which I‚Äôm anxious abt cos everything will be new to me, so it‚Äôs comforting to at least have someone na kaclose ko once I enter college life in an unfamiliar environment. Also, I‚Äôm pretty introverted kaya mejj nahihirapan ako makipagkaibigan, esp with guys. Plus, I‚Äôve been feeling kinda down lately, could use some good company :) Looking for someone new to talk to, wholesome lang cos I‚Äôm here for a legit relationship na long-term (hopefully). By relationship, I mean friends lang, but if we hit it off, maybe smth more? We‚Äôll see how things go. Me: - maputi with glasses, between 5‚Äô0‚Äù to 5‚Äô1‚Äù - cute ?? HAHA see for urself nalang - i‚Äôll be residing in QC pag nasa pinas na ako - mahiyain at first pero once i open up more, im the complete opposite + if kavibes kita, convos will flow easily - writing is my passion, mahilig magbasa, into filmmaking - watches all kinds of shit: films, netflix shows, youtube, docus, kdramas, just started getting into anime - love learning about history, mythology, arts, philosophy, etc. - music taste is generally rnb mixed with a bit of rap/hip-hop, i also listen to a few local artists - nagrereply agad, as much as i can ofc :) You - 18-20, maybe even 21? (incoming freshie or uni student lng) - single, open-minded, cute lowkey lol (but pls don‚Äôt get me wrong, ur personality/vibe matters the most to me) - nasa metro manila area - good sense of humor; fine with dark humor and dirty humor, u the type who enjoys memes and vines? even better - good conversationalist - can be my college buddy - can tolerate the time difference (5 hrs behind ph time) - not dds or marcos apologist pls - bonus pts nalang kung same music taste naten SHET sorry ang haba lmao, just wanna make sure I gave a proper intro abt me and what I‚Äôm looking for. Pero kahit nde same interests naten, I‚Äôm still willing to talk, that‚Äôs up to u ofc.

What exact points should I mention in what exact order when coming out as trans to my parents (face to face)?	"I plan on coming out to my parents as soon as I graduate school, write my exams and we all move to the capital of our country (we just want to live a better quality life). As soon as we rent or buy a new apartment or house in the new city, I want to come out as FtM to my parents. I want to tell them that I won't mind that much if they won't be able to see me as a son or get used to my new name and pronouns and other things, but I need my new future friends in Germany to know that I'm a trans man and that I want to change as much info about my gender in my documents as I'm able to so I can finally peacefully live the rest of my life as the gender I am, among other things. I just want to know how exactly I should say or script this whole thing. What other things do I need to mention like ""I trust you enough to tell you this"", ""I hope you'll respect my decision (to physically and socially transition, not to be a different gender obviously lol) among other things, in what way and what order should I say and mention these things? I'm sorry if what I'm saying doesn't make much sense. I want to give them a blunt and understandable speech about me being trans, how I feel about it and what I want to do about it, but I'm notorious for stumbling over my words, stuttering, using parasite words, and ESPECIALLY for constantly getting off track, repeating myself and having multiple very long brain farts. Basically, I'm not that good of a verbal talker, and it doesn't help that quarantine is further hindering my chances of verbally communicating with others (like in school). I want to add something else in this post but as I'm typing everything my brain is almost completely shut down and I'm not able to think clearly and I'm just kinda spewing sh_t right now so please forgive me lol."	asktransgender

Elfen Lied is honestly a great psychological horror, even if it's full of gore.	The first episode has got to be the most gory and brutal first episode of any anime I have seen. But after that, it gets better. The characters progress through the series as unaware of the brutality of the girl they are keeping safe, as well as showing the dark side of humans and split personality. The OST is also beautiful and fitting, and the ending is good. Also, there's an absolutely horrifying scene in this anime which literally had me scarred, if you like horror.	Animesuggest

US Poker Trip - Need tips on cities and rooms!	Hello Poker Friends, I am an avid and regular poker player - live and online. I live in Kansas City and the poker scene here is great! I know a few groups of players who host home games and the casinos have great action too. Harrah's and Hollywood are where it is at for the juicy games. Ameristar isn't too bad but overall not as hot as the other two. &#x200B; I try and play poker on every trip or vacation I go on. Sometimes just one session unless I base the whole trip around poker like I do when I went to Las Vegas twice. &#x200B; Cities I have played in: Many rooms on the Las Vegas strip, all the major ones Daytona Beach Poker Kennel Club Seattle Fortune Poker Omaha Horsehoe Downstream OK &#x200B; So overall it has only been a handful of cities but I want to expand that. I went to Vegas twice last year and was so excited to go again in April until it was shutdown. Too bad. But now I am more pumped than ever to go and I cannot wait. I have a lot of fyler points and can do at least 3 more trips. I want to go to Las Vegas once more of course but I really want to try to do a trip where I visit a city for just two nights and visit 2-3 poker rooms during my time in the city. Can you guys suggest good poker rooms in your cities to play in? Maybe we can have a meet up! Here are the cities I am thinking. &#x200B; Chicago Houston Tampa Bay / Orlando Somewhere on the East Coast Los Angeles Maybe Seattle again &#x200B; What do you guys have in mind?	poker

Why Odyssey is good and Valhalla may be bad	Yeah, the title is bait but it's a fair discussion, so please read it till the end. First of all, Odyssey is good, not perferct. I understand some of criticism, and agree with the most of them. But what I don't agree is with the overwhelming size of the map been a bad thing. The map and the design of places and cities of classical greece during the peloponnesian war is unprecedented and beatiful. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't recall seing other recreation so well made of that time. Sure it has historical inacurracies, but it's one of the best, if not the best, way to feeling how life was at that time. Said that, AC games changed, and to me since AC III the modern time lore lost it's meaning... Ubi is trying bring Layla as Desmond, but I don't see a good work on that. To the old AC fans like me, RPG is the way they find to keep the game fresh every 2 years, and the old aspects and gameplay are gonne. &#x200B; So, what expected about Valhalla? Besides the importance of the historical period, compared to Odyssey, Valhalla will suffer of that impact, living in a golden mythologic greece, to the cloudy northerm England. I'm preety sure the visual of the game will be outstanding, but explore Old Egypt or Greece feels more appealing. Other point to consider, myths. Yes, we all know about a lot of myths from vikings and celtic culture, most of RPG drink of this foutain, but as we approach the modern times the explanation to why we encouter myths in the free world become less plausible. Can be a glitch (Origins) or a simulation inside a simulation (Odyssey). Finally, to be clear I'm not trashing a yet to release game. I'm just been realistc on an analysis to what is about to come. To be honest I'm hoping the settlement aspect they are talking about compasate for the lacking of other things. My concern is that settlement aspect is something similar to The Division 2, to simple for an AC game.	assassinscreed
Can drones perform offline?	Rigger wants to tell his drone to go offline from the Matrix, perform a given task and then go back online. The goal is to prevent a spider from hacking the drone, while it is in a restricted area. I would rule no, because the rules offer the option of running drones silent, but I couldn't justify why a drone should not be able to run disconnected from the Matrix, when it uses its own programs and the Rigger loses the ability to connect with said drone for the entire time. So, can they do it? If not, what's some fluff/flavor I can use to explain this with?	Shadowrun
Why I'm riding in the road	"Dear asshole who yelled at me, here are many reasons I might be riding in the road. * there is broken glass or other debris in the bike lane, the bike lanes commonly have junk in them you would not want to ride over (or which might be dangerous) * someone has parked in the bike lane or stationed something in the bike lane, trust me when I say that the bike lane is always the first part of the road to be blocked by something or someone (trash cans, rideshare, orange cones, improperly parked vehicles, ...) * there are cars parked reaaaaaal close to the bike lane and I'm worried someone might open their door and send me head over heels. Usually I just keep my eyes peeled but if a car has tinted windows, or it's a truck, or my spidey sense tingles, I may move out of the bike lane * there's a big curb or ditch or hedge or something on the side of the road, I can't ride right next to something where if I swerve 6"" to the right I'll fall in a hole or hit a curb. Not usually a problem with actual bike lanes, but if there's no bike lane, this can be a real issue Trust me when I say, I want nothing less than to back up angry drivers behind me, so if I'm riding in the roadway I'm going to give you as much space as I can, or else get out of the roadway ASAP. Thanks, please don't yell at me any more."	SeattleWA

Intensity = Truth	"**Intensity = Truth** Something I do that deviates from the Neville's teachings is in the category of undesirable thoughts. I know in the topic of manifesting, undesirable thoughts are considered a no no. I understand completely why you would not want to think an undesirable thought. However, we must be honest with ourselves. There are thoughts in our minds that repeat themselves and at times we feel intense about them. Even when we try to think a different thought, the feelings of the undesirable thought linger on and makes it difficult to feel the desirable thought fully. I know in Neville's teachings, the way around this would be through understanding. Understand that you are withholding yourself in a State. You have the freedom to move into different States with no consequences. Give yourself this freedom and you will feel elated. This works for me. However... There are thoughts that are so stubborn and they feel so intense that sometimes understanding is not enough. For thoughts that seems to have lasting effects throughout the day, and causes you to feel down, worried, fearful, I do something, that at first may seem counterproductive. This is what I do: When I notice a thought that I deem ""undesirable,"" and this thought is giving me intense negative feelings such as fear, making my gut sink, worry and I simply cannot shake it off (This is only for stubborn thoughts, not ones that you can easy turn away from), I do this: >1. I identify the exact thought that is making me feel fear. > >2. I think of this thought deeply and why it is giving me fear. > >3. I keep repeating this thought on a loop and on each repeat I react to it less and less. > >4. Eventually you will come to a point where you are no longer reacting to the thought. Now after I do this. I go to the desirable thought I want to think. And this is what I do: >1. Think about the understand that you are simply withholding a State from yourself. Then think of the desirable thought. > >2. I feel the thought being fulfilled. > >3. I repeat this thought (visualize or speak) with feeling over and over. With each repetition, I feel it more intensely. > >4. I do this, like a rhythm, until all I feel and think are blissful thoughts and feelings. So, what exactly is being done here? With reacting less and less to the undesirable thought, you are taking away its power. The ONLY power it has, is in your reaction to it. With not reacting to it, it will no longer bother you. Then you cannot stop there. Stopping there will leave you feel neutral, which is not bad, but use this time to feel after your desire being fulfilled. With each repetition of feeling intensely about a desirable thought, you are fusing or identifying with that thought. From doing this with those stubborn thoughts, you will find that they will no longer bother you. You will also notice your mind will think, naturally, about the desirable thoughts because you feel intensely about them. Remember, your mind thinks truth is intensity. To the mind: Intensity = Truth As I said, this is my own method with stubborn thoughts. We all have a few, but I found this method to work. Hope it works for you as well."	EdwardArtSupplyHands

How do you be yourself everywhere you go?	Everyday is a challenge for me because I can only be myself in the company of myself.

My method is evolving!	"Thanks to the free time created by lockdown and some inspiration from you lovely people, I have been making some changes to my Dyna routine. I've been using the same 2018 M for years now, occasionally using it with my DIY jam jar water bubbler. That was it, no variation, nothing. It was almost becoming the same repetition that joint smoking had become. Soooo time for some changes! Firstly, I've made myself a 4"" wooden body to use around the house. The M body will still come camping and outdoors with me due to its durability, but this new wooden body has me feeling like a suave ass king now! The taste is great, no idea what type of wood - stick wood is my best guess, and the variety is really adding to the whole experience. I also made a 2.5"" wooden stubby for my pal - he's happy too. I had an offcut from all of this, so also made a 1"" water pipe adapter. Onto the jam jar bubbler! Guys, how has it taken me this long to ditch the water??? The taste is amazing!!! I was using it just with ice for a week, but now I've ditched that too and just leave the whole package in the freezer ready for when I need it. BOOM, no messing with ice or trying to toke up before the ice melts! Finally, all this gave me inspiration to clean everything. Like really clean everything. Yes I made a sweeet sweet reclaim coffee after dissolving pipes in milk, but then came the tools!! Scoring pads, ISO, Wire wool. Everything! Anyway, it tastes like new and I'm chuffed to pieces with my new ways. It's nearly 4.20 so its time for me to go load up. Thanks for the inspiration R/Dynavap!"	Dynavap

Halfords said their rear dashcam doubles up as a reversing camera. It does not. What can I do?	I am fucking livid. I went to Halfords and asked them to install a stereo, and asked for them to install a rear dashcam that can be used as a reversing camera too. They said the [HDC 400](https://www.halfords.com/technology/dash-cams/halfords-hdc400-dash-cam-535333.html) + [HDC-R](https://www.halfords.com/technology/dash-cams/halfords-hdc-r-rear-dash-cam-535341.html) was a great option. All in all I paid like ¬£600, went to reverse and the camera didn't come on the screen. Went back to Halfords a few days later and they told me it's not a reversing camera. I am fucking livid because I've already paid for it all. Is there anything I can do? They just said it's my problem and I can buy another reversing camera and pay for installation again.	AskUK

If this is a patch panel then I don't really need an AP right (plan is for GF to use wired connection upstairs assuming the patch panel is actually a patch panel)? Also planning to upgrade to gigabit internet. WFH due to COVID has warranted the upgrades and girlfriend needs a better connection upstairs since WiFi is inconsistent because of apartment layout/structure.	HomeNetworking

IT job market post-COVID?	Not sure if this is the right subred or category to post, but what is the IT job market like in the Texas area post-COVID? On one hand a lot of IT jobs can be work from remotely /home unlike flight attendants, pilots, hair salon, restaurant etc but on the other hand a lot of IT jobs can be more easily automated away compared to service sector gigs and since IT jobs tend to on average pay more then the employer has more incentive to cut/automate away even more. So all in all in relative terms, how is IT as in terms of job market doing in the age of COVID compared to other gigs?	sysadmin
Do people realise there's basically no evidence to suggest interest in GoT has reduced significantly?	"I could bore you all with a long list of television ratings, Google trends, and various IMDB visitor data suggesting that people still are completely fascinated by Game of Thrones. There's only one show that even comes close with interest a year later, and that's Breaking Bad. The narrative I see on the internet that ""no one cares about GoT anymore"" just doesn't add up when you actually start researching if that's true. People might not talk about it as much because they feel it's hard to do so without arguments, but there's an abundance of interest in various aspects of the show."	naath

Tips on Recovering from a Binge Sesh & Associated Shame/ Disappointment?	I‚Äôve been great about sticking to calorie limits (1750) for the first time in my life. Made it to about 5 weeks, and posted on r/progresspics (my main motivation), but deleted my post with the progress I was so proud of after receiving too many sexual DMs. Since then, I‚Äôve felt very low energy (‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù), have been oversleeping and had 3 days where I massively oversnacked (with an extra 2000+ calories). Does anyone have tips for renewing hope and motivation? I was so excited to watch the numbers on my scale go down, and now it all feels so out of reach/ pointless when I can wreck it all as easily as running to the store and eating too big a bag of chips. And it sucks to not be able to share my progress. Being sexualized for normal pics of my body just makes me want to hide my body and never show off my progress again.	loseit

Ever since his death, Kobe has been overrated.	Firstly, I think Kobe is one of the greatest players in basketball history and I don't think he is bad. Now that that is clarified, ever since Kobe's death I have seen more people than ever putting Kobe above Lebron James on GOAT lists for basketball. The popular opinion before his death was 1st Jordan, 2nd Lebron, and 3rd Kobe but now all of a sudden Kobe is almost always 2nd. I have no problem with people thinking Kobe is better than Lebron but I don't think it's fair nor would Kobe want to be considered better than another player, purely because he is dead and the other player is alive.	unpopularopinion

If you blew a long term quit and you‚Äôre struggling this is especially for you	Hey all, first post here. I‚Äôd like to share my story. I started smoking heavily at age 15. I also drank and was heavily dependent on a cocktail of substances that landed me in various rehabs and institutions over the years. At 22 I decided I wanted to get sober. I was going though all sorts of withdrawals (under medical care) and I reasoned if I had to endure this pain I might as well quit smoking at the same time also. 4 years and countless AA meetings later I‚Äôm completely sober and smoke free. My life is better than I could have ever imagined. I graduated college, I found myself a job, I‚Äôve got a pretty decent truck, and I even convinced a nice young lady to be my girlfriend. She smoked. I convinced myself I missed smoking. I told myself the cravings hadn‚Äôt gotten any better. So I shared a cigarette with her and my god was it disgusting. A few hours later I did it again. Next day I bought a pack and I was hooked like I never quit. A year and half later we broke up and I was probably averaging 30 cigs a day. I felt awful, I knew I smelled awful and I felt like I was never going to be able to quit again. I‚Äôd stop for a day, maybe even a week and just keep telling myself like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no point, I blew my 4 year quit... I‚Äôll never be able to go that long again.‚Äù Well I‚Äôm here to say I‚Äôve quit again. I‚Äôm approaching 3 years nicotine free again. I say nicotine free because trust me I‚Äôve chewed gum, I‚Äôve vaped, always to smoke again. I‚Äôve only ever found success facing the pain of withdrawal and coming out on the other side. That‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs experience and truth but it is mine. So today I‚Äôve been clean and sober from drugs for over 10 years and almost 3 years from cigarettes. I‚Äôve got my problems with mental health etc but nothing is worth smoking over. Stay strong DM me if you need support!!!	stopsmoking
Internal app with angularjs (v1) SPA front end, Laravel API backend and want to add AD login	i think i have read just about every page on MSAL and Azure AD but still struggling to figure out how to connect all the pieces for my particular application. There is a mix of internal users ([name@mycompany.com](mailto:name@mycompany.com)) and external users (customers, suppliers etc.). Currently all login with username and password stored in my application but I want to allow internal users to use their AD login. I want to add a Login with MS button and after successful authentication, syncs some of the user's data to their profile in my app database e.g. name, phone etc. I also want to flag them as being an AD user so I can then disable the editing of these things within my app. I will be working on a mobile app in the near future as well and require the same authentication. So, firstly I was wondering what my auth flow will be and think it is one of the following options: 1) Setup an Azure AD app with implicit flow and use MSAL.js to handle the login and then pass the token to my api which can then connect to Azure/Graph and sync the data and flag the user. I have actually got the first part of this working but can't figure out what i need to pass to my api as the token doesn't work. I am also aware that implicit seems to be not preferred due to security issues 2) When user clicks login button, redirect them to my api which then does a auth redirect flow. I still have the issue of redirecting back to my frontend with some sort of cookie. This method doesn't really work with the mobile app so I think 1) is the only way to do it.	AZURE

I've also struggled with depression and the thought of continuing to not enjoy sex as much as I could is sending me back down. I know this community will be supportive and helpful. Thanks for reading.	NoFap

[BF4] campaign assignments	bf4 campaign assignments not awarded yesterday i played through the entire bf4 campaign so I could unlock the p90 for multiplayer. After i beat the campaign i went into multiplayer to use it and it wasn‚Äôt unlocked. I looked at my single player assignments and it said i had 0/8 or whatever it is. I know i completed almost all of them because i would unlock them at the end of the mission. Is there any way to fix this besides replaying the campaign? PS4	Battlefield

RE3 DLC?	My first play through I was really disappointed that they omitted the clock tower, but my second play through, I noticed the time between Carlos getting to Jill seemed really long since it said like half a day and that that is the only part of the game where it isn‚Äôt specific about the exact time. And he got to Jill from the inside of the clock tower. I haven‚Äôt read anything about DLC, but does anyone think Carlos going through the clock tower might be some type of DLC speed run type mission? It just seemed really odd to me that it took a half a day for him to get from the police station to the clock tower and that he showed up from inside of it. Maybe he could go through the park as well?	residentevil

Wife has boyfriend, contacted lawyer.	My wife has taken advantage of me for the last time, today I contacted a lawyer. She is a taker, never a giver and I have nothing more to give. My giving well is empty after she always drew from it but never replenished the reservoir. A giant weight has been lifted, I'm 40 with a 17 year old son who will be a senior this year. I'm hold fast for the next six months, I want to see if the housing market tanks so I can keep the home, and finish raising my son in it. Only 60K in equity, I need the market to correct 25% so my mortgage will be underwater when I file. I have a good rate, screw selling the home and it's in my name. We have 5 acers of land in the hills, worth about 60K, but the well doesn't work, so I think I can get it down to 45K in worth, which equals out debt. I want to keep the house, keep my land, keep the debt, and she can go draw from her bum of a boyfriend's well. Have fun you toxic POS, the war has begun!	Divorce

Anybody here ever microdosing psychedelics?	I‚Äôve been microdosing .05-.1 of mushrooms and it‚Äôs really helped me be honest with myself and create new ways to effectively compile my thoughts by journaling. I‚Äôve never had those thoughts in one place besides my head so I‚Äôve never been able to look at them holistically until now. It‚Äôs helping me push aside (not completely stave off) a lot of doubt I had in my prior transition (I detransd) and am on my second transition that began with a fuck ton of doubt. But when your life is shit already there‚Äôs not much left to lose. So I took the plunge and a day after my first day back on HRT I‚Äôve been microdosing the mushrooms and Again it‚Äôs helped me a lot... anybody have a similar experience?	asktransgender

I have an idea for an add on (Maths specifically). But I‚Äôm not sure if it is possible.	So first off, if this already exists, let me know. I‚Äôll present this as the current problem we have, and a proposed solution. Problem: Let‚Äôs say for example we are trying to learn the mean(Statistics). The mean is the sum of all the numbers / total number of numbers. And let‚Äôs also take into consideration, that the best way to learn Maths(or a good technique anyway) is to practise problems/equations over and over again(like we do in school). So if we were to learn the mean with Anki, we could have a Question like: Calculate the mean of 4, 5, 6, 2, 9, 3, 4, 6, 8 The problem here is that this same question will be repeated and always have the same answer. The dilemma is we will be so familiar with the numbers we see that we will automatically know the answer without even have to do the calculation. THIS IS NOT LEARNING. This is association(muscle memory of sorts). Solution: So how would we combat this? Well in school we do. We practise mean by doing mean equations with a different set of numbers each time. Forcing us to do the calculation in order to get the answer. That‚Äôs the trick, there‚Äôs no longer a memorisation of an answer to a set of numbers because the numbers are always ransoms. Implementing this idea in Anki would be great(in my opinion). So how would this work? We could enter the equation for the mean into Anki and have it associated with the card(this mean equation will not be visible to viewer when reviewing) The Anki question will generate random numbers for the Question part, and enter these numbers into the equation to get the answer for the answer part. We now have random numbers so we are forced to do the mean calculation every time Thoughts?	Anki

[m4A/a] Terrible, Dreadful Feminization	A lot of gender transformation content, be it stories, captions, or comics, end with a clean-cut ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù. The guy turns female, and while at first he might hate it, he learns to love *her* new body. Things generally end alright for her, and in many cases, she‚Äôs in a better spot than when she started. This is not one of those scenarios. Something that‚Äôs always fascinated me about transformation in general is the feeling of dread and terror in can evoke. This is primarily the case in the body horror genre, but I believe it can take place in the gender transformation niche as well. Let‚Äôs be real here, if you did start to lose shrink inch by inch, wouldn‚Äôt you be worried? When your chest began to grow flabby, and latter expand outwards into blossoming breasts, wouldn‚Äôt you be at least a tad concerned? And when your memories themselves started to slip away, and you found your formerly masculine self began dreaming about lip gloss and dresses, wouldn‚Äôt terror shoot up your spine? In short, I‚Äôm interested about exploring how horrifying it‚Äôd be to go from a perfectly masculine guy into a giggly girly girl. Ideally, the transformation should be slow and drawn out; all the more time to appreciate the impending doom. If you‚Äôre interested in this sort of transformation, hit me up. I‚Äôd love to either just chat about our mutual interests, or work out an RP. **No Reddit Chat please** Kinks (not all kinks listed needed to be discussed or incorporated): Gender transformation, slow-burn transformations, girly-girls, bimbofication, girly outfits, mental alterations, identity death, bad ends.

China Asked The WHO To Help Cover Up Coronavirus, German Intelligence Concludes	[China Asked The WHO To Help Cover Up Coronavirus, German Intelligence Concludes](https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/09/china-who-coronavirus-coverup-germany/) >Chinese Leader Xi Jinping personally asked the World Health Organization to delay the release of critical information regarding its coronavirus outbreak, German intelligence has concluded. >Xi met with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on January 21 to request that he withhold information about human-to-human transition and delay the declaration of a global pandemic, according to [German magazine Der Spiegel. - | *Does Beijing have to pay for the pandemic damage?*| ](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/corona-ausbruch-vertuscht-muss-china-fuer-die-pandemie-schaeden-zahlen-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000170816271) The news comes amid rising sentiment that China should be held financially responsible for the pandemic. >**‚ÄúThe BND‚Äôs* verdict is harsh: At least four, if not six, weeks have been lost in Beijing‚Äôs information policy in the fight against the virus,‚Äù Der Spiegel reported.** (emphasis mine) *BND is the native German acronym for its Federal Intelligence Service. ---------------- [Lawfare:](https://www.lawfareblog.com/covid-19-lawsuits-against-china) >At least six lawsuits have been filed against China in U.S. federal courts seeking damages for deaths, injuries and economic losses caused by covid-19. Members of Congress have drafted legislation to strip China of its immunity from suit in U.S. courts. Even if enacted, these congressional efforts are unlikely to pave the way for successful lawsuits ‚Äî and they could prompt China to take reciprocal measures against the United States. China should be held accountable in other ways, including through diplomatic pressure and a thorough U.S. investigation of Beijing‚Äôs role in concealing and failing to stop the spread of covid-19. ------------ Global Times: >[COVID-19 lawsuits against China are illegal by international law](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1187897.shtml) >These international claims against China are mainly being carried out in two ways. First, by filing lawsuits against China in domestic US courts; and second, by appealing to international legal institutions for possible recompense. >Suing China in US courts can be argued as vexatious litigation. As a sovereign state, China is immune from the jurisdiction of any foreign court. This is China's right under international law, not some privilege granted by foreign countries. Therefore, suing China in a US court challenges the doctrine of sovereign immunity and disrupts the international order. ------------------- * Should immunity from prosecution of China be reversed? * Do you think China should be held responsible for the Covid19 outbreak? * Doing a search on this issue you will find many articles all stating it would be illegal and il-advised to sue China over this issue. Do you believe these articles (written almost daily in various medias ) are all organic in nature, or do you believe there is a coordinated effort to let China off the hook for the spread of Covid19. -*remember, china prohibited flights out of wuhan into other areas of china, while allowing international flights out of wuhan to continue - this is a proven fact.*	CoronaVirusInfo

I've never had ANYONE leave a match before ranked was released	Please RIOT do something. 50% of the ranked games I've played had 1 or 2 players leaving of AFK'ing after 3 rounds.

I've never experienced any such thing from any other video game I ever played (except LoL - for some reason :) - but even there it's not THIS bad) This is unacceptable, especially considering that I've NEVER EVER experienced such thing BEFORE ranked was released. **It's clearly a sign that certain players can't handle the pressure.** Maybe have a behavior score that pairs leavers with other leavers?

This gem from r/banvideogames	Not all gamers are bad. In fact, there are good ones. For example, I'm a good gamer.

I don't go and call people disrespectful things. Yeah, I may see inappropriate things in games sometimes, but I don't let that influence me. I know that things I do in games should stay in games. If anything, gaming to me is nothing more than entertainment and a way of passing time. Just because a few gamers have done bad stuff in the past, it doesn't mean that all gamers are like that, and I certainly won't let videogames have that effect on me. But I'm still going to keep playing, because I enjoy it, as I have done for about 10 years. Downvote, brigade, do whatever. I don't care. But at the end of the day, I'm trying to prove a point here.	copypasta

Pick A Card, Any Card	This is a (not entirely sure honestly) **Specialist/Conjuration** technique. # Pick A Card, Any Card The user **Conjures** a nen space where he and the opponent are surrounded by **54** playing cards facing downwards. The space is conjured by saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to pick a card.‚Äù The user and his opponent cannot harm each other or the nen space while the game is active. The user and the opponent must each pick up one card, the cards have the effects that follow: * **Hearts/Diamonds** grant positive effects or boosts to whoever picks them up. These effects are scaled in power depending on the card picked up. (**Two** being the lowest, **Ace** being the highest). * **Spades/Clubs** place negative effects on whoever picks them up. These effects are scale in power depending on the card picked up. (**Two** being the lowest, **Ace** being the highest.) * **Jokers** are instant death to whoever picks them up. # Conditions/Limitations * Once the room is **conjured** the user must explain the game he and his opponent will be playing to allow the cards to appear. * The **cards** spawn at random every time this ability is used and are indiscernible from one another. * The **user** is just as susceptible to the negative effects of the cards as his opponent. * Once each player has picked a card the game ends and they are transported back to the real world. * The **positive/negative** effects of the cards are random depending on who picks them up. * If the ability is used in the same opponent, the cards drawn are **NOT** added back into the pool of cards until all the cards have been drawn. (Ex. You draw a 5 of spades, the next time the game is played the 5 of spades is not in the room.) Das it. This is an ability for a villain (obviously). Basically it's someone you would see in an anime such as Kakegurui, they get off to gambling and the rush of putting their life and other person's on the line. Hope you enjoyed	HatsuVault

[Help] Should we get another Minature Poodle, or one of these following breeds? (Coton, Lhasa Apso, Havanese or Bichon Frise)	"**Introduction** 1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? * We have a 12-year-old miniature poodle mix. The SO has had him since the poodle was a puppy. I've been with him for the past three years. I really enjoy training him. 2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? * We're looking into a breeder. 3) Describe your ideal dog. * I prefer a dog that's easily trainable. I love teaching the miniature poodle little tricks. I also prefer a dog with a long life span, that feels ""sturdy."" We are looking for a gentle dog, that will be good with other dogs and children in the future. We want a dog that can tolerate both cold weather (the 20s-30s) and really hot humid weather easily. My SO wants a dog that he can go on long walks with. We want a calmer dog. My SO has horrible allergies, so we want a dog that doesn't shed at all. 4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? * Minature Poodle - We have one. He's so easy to train. He's intelligent, sweet, and loving. He's a peacemaker, he wants everyone to get along and it's hard to be mad when he prances over to make things better. He doesn't shed. We trust him to stay with us on a walk. We enjoy watching him explore his world and figure out new things, his intelligence is very apparent. **However**, we're looking at other breeds cause he can be VERY sensitive and startle easily. He can also be very stubborn, he knows how to come, but he probably won't unless he feels like it. He's also independent....he'll cuddle but ONLY on his terms and when he feels like it. He's not very playful or goofy, he's a serious and proud dog. He also requires a lot of stimulation since he's so smart. He figures out new puzzles and kongs so quickly. This is great when we want to go on a 2-hour walk, but not so great at 1 pm in the middle of a work meeting or after a long day when we just want to chill. Also, he has a strong prey drive which can make walks difficult when all of a sudden he lunges at a bird out of nowhere, it is kind of nice though cause he catches bugs for us sometimes. * Havanese - Seem similar to a poodle, but more playful and goofy. I've heard they're harder to train and it can take MONTHS to potty train. This wouldn't be great since we live in an apartment and work full-time, but we are fans of the lower energy level. A straight coat is also appealing since the curly coat is hard to brush out every day, but we've heard they shed more than a Minature Poodle. * Coton - This is the breed we're looking at the most. They seem exactly like poodles, except with lower energy and less sensitive and more playful. Which seems perfect. We're not sure about how much they shed though. There also doesn't seem to be as much information about their temperament in general since they're a newer breed. * Lhasa Paso - They are really cute, and seem really sturdy for smaller dogs. However, we've heard that they can be quite territorial and dominant. Our poodle can be territorial at times, but for the most part he likes strangers. He won't wander off with them, but he's fine with them being around. I've heard they're not great with small kids either. However, they're intelligent and really trainable without having a high energy level. That's why we're looking at this breed. * Bichon Frise - Just like the Coton, they seem similar to Poodles in temperament but just more relaxed about everything and have less energy. Unlike the Coton, they seem not as trainable. 5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? * We love training our current dog to do ""cute"" tricks (wave, high five, etc). We also like playing games with him (guess which hand, find it, hide and seek). We also enjoy doing agility training with him, although it's more of a once in a while thing because we live in an apartment so we have to go out to a training center. 6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? * We don't want to complete, but it is fun to train this stuff just for fun. I enjoy it as a bonding experience with my dog. However, it does kind of feel like our current poodle NEEDS this type of training to tire him out. I'd rather do the training when I feel like it. **Care Commitments** 7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? * Our current poodle gets 1 hour - 3 hours of walks a day. The 1 hour is only when we're too busy to do otherwise and we can tell it's too little for him. He gets really restless and starts nosing us for attention and can't settle down. That's the hard part. We also do 30 minutes of training a day, he does better with more but he's able to pick up new stuff with 30 minutes because he can train so easily. So we'd like another dog that we can train with that kind of time commitment as well. We also really want to have our dog lay by us while we do stuff (work, watch tv, hobbies). With our current dog, it's more like once we have a moment it's time to go outside or train him, and ONCE he's properly tired out, we can chill. That's really exhausting and unenjoyable on days we're super busy, which lately seems like more days than not. 8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? * 1 hour - 3 hours depending on the days, and it'll be walks. We don't like using dog walks since we live in a city and there's no segregation between the smaller and large dog sections. 9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? * We will take our dog to the groomer once a week. We do daily brushing for the poodle, we could use a bit of a lower maintenance coat. Maybe a weekly brush instead of a daily brush. **Personal Preferences** 10) What size dog are you looking for? * We want a smaller dog, but not a teeny tiny dog. Our poodle is around 15 lbs and about a foot tall. We want a dog around that size. 11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? * No shedding or slobber. We can handle minimal barking. Our dog barks occasionally when he hears a lot of noise outside, and we wouldn't want more than that. 12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? * This would be really nice to do as it's hard to find fenced-in areas for us. My parents have a large unfenced lawn. We trust our current dog to stay by us enough for us to let go of the leash, but we never take the leash completely off. In case he sees a bird and starts darting towards it. **Dog Personality and Behavior** 13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? * Snuggly dog, but one that's okay with being away for us when we need to work. We want a dog that'll cuddle with us when we want to cuddle and is okay chilling when we can't. Right now it's the opposite, we're more on our dog's schedule than the other way around lol. 14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please? * Eager to please.... but on our terms. Again, when we're working we want a dog to settle down. 15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? * We prefer that our dog is excited to meet strangers and visitors when they're coming in. We like what our current poodle does, if he thinks we're not aware of someone (like if he sees someone in my parents' yard), he'll bark to alert us to them. But if they're coming into the house and it's clear that we know, he doesn't care. He also doesn't care if walkers come into the house to take him out and he doesn't know them. 16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? * No, we have an existing senior dog. It's important that this dog tolerates other dogs. 17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid? * Biting, territorial, guarding, excessive barking, and shedding. **Lifestyle** 18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? * 8-10 hours a day once corona is over, with a walker coming in during mid-day to take them out. 19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? * My SO will be involved in taking care of the dog, he doesn't enjoy doing training but he likes going on long walks around the city and cuddling with the dog while playing video games/watching TV. 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? * We have an existing Minature Poodle Mix. Mixed with Maltese, but his personality/appearance is solely Minature Poodle. 21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? * Yes, we plan on having kids in the next 5 years. The exact timeline is not yet determined. 22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? * We currently rent. There are no restrictions though. 23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? * Washington DC, and yes 24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? * In the summer, it's an average of 80-90, but often gets into the 100s. It's also extremely humid, so it feels a lot hotter than it is. In the winter it stays around 40 degrees but can dip into the 20s for a few weeks. It also rains a lot. **Additional Information and Questions** * No additional information. 26) Feel free to ask any questions below. * As we've said, we have a miniature poodle but are looking at a few other breeds (Coton, Lhasa Apso, Havanese & Bichon). I was hoping to get some feedback so we can make the best decision for our family. Thank you in advance for those who take the time to read all of this! I really appreciate it."	dogs

Sugar free Jello... pros and cons	"5'6"" 28m 260lbs here. I've always had a sweet tooth and have found myself turning towards sugar free jello here lately. I know that artificial sweeteners aren't good for you, but I'm wanting to lose quite a bit of weight and obtain a healthier lifestyle. I'm just now starting to try to get more active and start walking several times a week. In terms of sweets/cheats, I'm not going to be able to give them up. I'll be honest. My issue is portion control and I feel like for the most part jello is a guilt free item. But what exactly are the pros and cons of sugar free jello? Will this have a negative impact on my goals or is it a better alternative to mindlessly eating snacks? I'm new here, but already feel better seeing how supportive some of these communities are. Any tips or suggestions are very much appreciated."	loseit

Question about More Time Ready (MTR) program	We are set to have a shift drop tomorrow - 5/12. No one seems to know (not even managers) what week the shifts are dropping for. Most of us are gold and already have shifts for next week. If the MTR shifts drop for the following week (week of 5/19) we won't be able to pick them up because we're already scheduled. Should we drop what we have and wait on the MTR shifts? If we do that, and the shifts drop, like they do for Gold, two weeks out (week of 5/26) we won't meet the 30 hour minimum required for MTR.

"Is it realistic that characters, when told ""Get away from there NOW!"" by a close person, do not take that seriously?"	"I have seen this multiple times in TV shows/animations/movies, etc. When the protagonist, upon receiving information that a family member/close friend etc will encounter a great danger (i.e., the building will explode, or a serial murderer is coming there right now), calls the person shouting ""There's no time! Get away from there, NOW!"", and the person is just asking ""What do you mean? Why should I leave?"" etc wasting time. In some cases, even when the protagonist told the reason ""Someone is coming to kill you!"", the person asks ""who is that person?"" etc, wasting time. And then they die or get killed. Is this a realistic reaction for the most people? I am asking because I would run away as fast I can without wasting the time asking for more questions."	NoStupidQuestions

Pickup tower woes, what could I have done differently?	"Warning, I am a customer, not an associate, so have your kid-gloves ready please. So I bought a blender on Walmart.com using ship-to-shore, I've bought other things using ship-to-store before and it was always relatively smooth and expedient, albeit this was my first time ordering to this particular store. it comes to the store a week later and I get there at 7 am to avoid the covid crazies and do some grocery shopping before the pickup tower is open. At 8:45 am I check out my groceries and head to the tower to pick up my order. No one else is there so I assume it shouldn't take very long. I attempt to check in using the screen on the pickup tower itself and it tells me ""error communicating with the tower!"". Okay fine I'll just check in on my phone, so I do. My name pops up on the screen and says ""checked in"" and the computer tells me to wait for an associate to bring me my order. 10 minutes go by and nobody seems to notice me as my cold groceries get warmer, fortunately I didn't buy any ice cream. I ask the person at the customer service desk if I'm supposed to go find someone to help me get my order and he tells me he'll put in a call over the PA for me. He does and I return to the tower. 10 more minutes go by and still nothing. At this point I've been passed by no less than 10 different associates of various departments: yellow vests, dark blue vests, cart wranglers, people wearing walkies, and one woman not in uniform but wearing a large Walmart ID badge and carrying a walkie who I assumed must be someone important. For context I'm not an easily overlooked person, I'm a 6'4"" man wearing a tie-dye shirt and palm tree print shorts. I didn't want to be *""that guy""* so I wait another 5 minutes before calling the number on the sign nearby that says it's a direct line to the pickup staff, someone answers the phone and tells me they'll get my order for me. 5 more minutes go by and I see the guy they have guarding the front gate (due to covid) come in and when he sees me he says over his walkie ""OGP you have a customer waiting at the pickup tower"" and lets me know they're getting my order. After 5 more minutes of sweating cheese, thawing meat, and googling what OGP meant (I now know it means Online Grocery Pickup) I finally spot someone approaching me with a box who hands it to me and says ""here you go, have a nice day"". I quickly thank him and leave. Now, I've worked several retail jobs before so I know that shit happens: the computers are buggy, people don't show up for their shift, everywhere is chronically understaffed, etc. So I'm not really upset at the employees (I'm not going complain to corporate either, I know that doesn't do any good and just harms the people on the bottom.) in this situation, what I want to know is how can I avoid this situation in the future without being a real Karen? Obviously getting my pickup order before shopping for groceries is at the top of my list but that means I'm forced to shop around *more* people at a time like this, and also it doesn't alleviate the unacceptable ~40 minutes of waiting...

I think I broke my nose on my daughter's head.	I was doing a workout and foolishly closed my eyes for a brief moment while bending over. I didnt know she walked in front of me and smashed my nose with her head. I heard a nasty crunch and now my head is POUNDING. She's fine. It just knocked her over and she's confused as to why I'm in pain. She keeps bringing me toys to make me feel better and giving me hugs.	FML
"Xbox One ""Map Failed to Load"" Question"	I was curious, I had the issue at the second meeting of the gods, and eventually plowed through it and the ship map loaded. So my question is, I deleted all my saves and created a new one, should I keep playing or should it uninstall, delete and start a brand new file? If I do That will I still have all my Berath Blessings? I have No issue starting over if I can get a quick bump to get me a head start with the Blessings. &#x200B; Anyone try this before or know what to do when you get the Message?	projecteternity
It's so annoying when people type like 'omgggg did you see thatttt I knnnoooowwww'.	(This is a lame one.) Maybe most adults can't relate with this, and I'm pretty sure this is a preteen-teen thing, but pretty much everyone I know texts like, 'Omggg, thankkkk youuuu Ilyyyyyyy' and it's SO annoying. Better use caps or a bunch of exclamation marks. But please, please for the love of God, don't use dragged letters. It's so pissinggggg offffff (see?). I'm not even talking about an exclamation per se. I'm talking about regular conversations. Maybe something like, 'Did you hear what Sara said about Julie?' and the response goes something like, 'dudeeeee yaaaaa I can't evennnnnnn'. Maybe I'm just weird in that sense, but I end up reading it as 'dudeyyyyyyy'. Hopefully this is a habit people grow out of, because it's frustrating.	unpopularopinion
DM possesses my character for no reason , I get really salty	Am I just salty or is my DM not managing the story correctly ? Okay ,because this story‚Äôs characters are similar in their class and race I will refer to them with appropriate numbers. So , the story starts with our party traveling by ship in order to cross a big ocean dividing the two lands . We were about level 5 , me being a wizard and my friends playing as two monks and two fighters (Yeah , I know , what a diverse group) . Anyway , as we were traveling a strange melody, which was caused by Sirens ( a redesigned version of the Harpy , used by our DM to make a similar encounter while keeping the underwater theme) lured the ship‚Äôs crew along with two of our party members . Me and one fighter 1 were almost lured but managed to lock the door of the storage space before we could proceed any further . Fighter 2 nearly jumped as monk 1 (who succeeded on the saving throw) grabbed him and tied him up with a rope. Monk 2 jumped down and was nearly brought to the bottom of the ocean by the ‚Äúharpies‚Äù. After monk 1 tried to help us regain our conscience by slapping the hell out of us , he managed to persuade the fighter to dive and try to rescue monk 2 , in which he succeeded . As he was being pulled up by the string we tied him to so we could be sure he wouldn‚Äôt die , a bunch of weird sea creatures started to appear in 2 waves . Wave 1 consisted of 8 enemies while wave 2 consisted of 11 . They slowly started climbing our ship and walking on the deck , Spears in hand .As I was pretty low on hp , I decided it was time to devise my master plan . A while back we had defeated a necromancer whose scepter was a powerful magical item . We decided to use his skull and create an all-powerful scepter which according to the DM made all spells deal only necrotic damage and dealt an additional d4 for all necromancy spells . Not that bad of an item at this level , but knowing my DM I suspected that there would be something wrong with it . I rolled multiple investigation checks , one being a nat20 that along with my +8 modifier should be pretty trustable . He said the same thing he told us about it the previous time and continued on narrating . So , when the time came for me to use it , I thought that I could turn the fireball‚Äôs damage to necrotic and use it against the crowd of enemies while not hurting our ship (materials are immune to necrotic damage). Instead , an army of black smoke undead was released which killed everything except our party on sight while the scepter burnt my left hand and after that my right one as I proceeded to hold it still in order to maintain control of the black smoke undead army . After that the army surrounded the rest of the party and pretty much scared the hell out of them . At that moment a black cloak appeared and covered me , in an attempt to posses me . The cloak pulled me upward and as I slowly became a dark figure I approached the party and fused with the smoke to create an illusion of a dragon head . My party immediately recognized it as we had engaged with him in a fight and eventually killed him , struggling to remain alive in the process. Anyway , the dragon talked about a curse and slowly disappeared, creating an object similar to a sphere that was extremely dark but seemed like a very reflective surface . That was when the DM told me I disappeared in the darkness , along with everything else that had threatened the party. Fighter 1 , being a dwarf , kicked it as far as he could knocking it back and creating a vision for the rest of the party which basically pictured me walking and getting on my knees along with other people who seemed a lot like necromancers(I had also picked the school of Necromancy while our main antagonist was one , yeah I know , bad life decisions.). They were all bowing down to a man in a throne , and the vision ended with me looking at them with a faceless expression , indicating that I have been probably possessed . Now ,May I add the fact that after using the staff to perform the spell , My dm never asked for a single save . He basically took control of my character by telling me a lie about a magic item which we ourselves had created and then sent me to a place I can do nothing about and told me to roll up a new sheet . All that story and connection and bonding between the part for the DM to ruin it by sending me to the Shadow Realm or something . The party was pretty upset as I was the only one to be able to control the ship and every other person had attack spells apart from me , who had a mixture of everything . The session ended with monk 2 (who I could have easily stabilized with toll the dead or helped with my healing supplies and +8 in medicine) grasping to breath and being between life and death while the other characters got in an argument about the sphere . TL;DR : DM lied about an item so I would use it and get banished and possessed for a long time for whatever reason and now my party is in desperate need of help , as I have no way of introducing my new character in the ship. Edit : Sorry for any structural or grammatical errors , English isn‚Äôt my natural language so yeah. P.S:Any comment discussing a fault of mine or the DMs would be very much appreciated, as Want my party to stay together and as far as I‚Äôve been part of this adventure I‚Äôve had a pretty good time	rpghorrorstories

LPT: If you want to multiply numbers without actually multiplying, learn the square numbers.	Here‚Äôs the algorithm. Take two numbers. Take the sum of the numbers and the difference of the numbers. Then divide both by two. Then take the difference of the squares. This only works for when both numbers are odd or even. If one is even and the other odd, the divide out the 2 and multiply it in at the end. For example. 7 * 13 would require a pen and paper right? Wrong. 13 + 7= 20 => 20/2 = 10 13 - 7 = 6 => 6/2 = 3 Then 10^2 =100, 3^2 =9 The answer is 100 - 9 = 91	LifeProTips

Everyone is having less sex, not just men.	[https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-lose-virginity-later-than-previous-generations-2018-5?r=US&IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-lose-virginity-later-than-previous-generations-2018-5?r=US&IR=T) According to the 'Next Steps' longitudinal study in the UK and data from them National Centre for Health Statistics in the US, the age at which young people lose their virginity is rising, for both men and women. Additionally, the average number of sexual partners had by each person is decreasing, and is much lower than that of our parents. A common facet of TRP is the idea of female hypergamy - that a small number of men are sexually monopolising a greater body of women. This at first seems like a reasonable perspective for men to have, with them generally struggling more on the most popular medium to find sexual/romantic partners at the current time - online dating. They outnumber women on dating profiles, and generally receive less likes, matches and attention. From their perspective, women are all easily finding hookups while they cannot. If this is true, then why is it that women are also statistically having less sex? Whats happening here? What about the 'cock carousel'? The answer is fairly simple: the idea of female hypergamy is flawed, because the subgroup of women participating in it is small in the same way that the subgroup of men who are capable of participating in it is small. Women are simply choosing not to hook up, even if it would be comparatively easier for them to be successful in doing so. Overall, this balances out and both genders are having less sexual activity. Why are many women choosing not to participate in hookup culture? We can only guess. Anecdotally (which isn't worth much) as a 19 year old college student, most of my peers are other females and most of us spend a large portion of our time working on schoolwork (in a relatively intense STEM program) or participating in sports, clubs or student societies. Most of us are uninterested in hooking up, want relationships, but do not realistically have the time for them. The result is that we are all effectively celibate, despite TRP stating the opposite. Fundamentally, I think most women would prefer a relationship to a ONS. When a relationship is not realistically attainable for a woman (due to being busy with other things, or just not that interested in dating at that time), women remove themselves from the sexual marketplace altogether, leading to a kind of dating pool 'inflation'. I think TRP is flawed at the point at which it misunderstands where modern issues in sexual relationships stem from; which is that women are simply more content being celibate and single than men are.

[HUGE spoilers for season 1] a summary of season 1's main events. [like seriously, this spoils everything, go watch the show if you haven't already]	"so [u/KaylieKonrad](https://www.reddit.com/user/KaylieKonrad/) posted wanting a recap of season 1 as it's been a while. I was originally going to comment on there, but it turned out to be so long I thought some other people could make some use of it, seeing that season 2 just got released a couple days ago. i'm assuming you know the basic storyline, three teens wake up in a room unsure of who or where they are, they solve puzzles and get out of bad situations all whilst trying to get home, theorising on where they are and get help from an omniscient and omnipotent god. so let's get deeper than just a very brief summary: the three main characters, Adam, Mira and Kai wake up in a bunker and solve a puzzle to get out, their main goal from the beginning is to get home and not die along the way, while theorising on where they are and why they're in this strange world. along the way, they meet this strange guy who can help them get out of situations and shed light on where they are, in a cryptic kinda way. they each discover that they have superpowers, Adam has super strength, Kai can control fire and knows a lot about mechanics and electronics, and Mira can breathe underwater, swim extremely well and speak to animals. after they make bonds, discover their powers, become comfortable in the world and make sense of things, they start to adjust and focus their energy on getting home. after falling through a portal the strange guy put there, they meet a talking tree who is missing a branch. the tree tells them that if they can get the branch back from some devil monks, she can take them home. the branch, as it turns out, is an insanely powerful weapon called the Ishibo. they manage to retrieve it from the monks after their leader falls to his death, but another group of three teens (ill call them group 2) who also have superpowers show up and steal it, making a quick getaway. After finding which direction group 2 went in, they find themselves in a western town, where they meet group 2, and this time have a civil discussion with them. group 2 is made up of Vanessa, Skeet and Reeve, who have powers of flight, speed and telekinesis respectively. Vanessa charms Kai into teaming up with group 2, but Adam and Mira aren't so trusting. Skeet and Reeve tell the trio that they lost the Ishibo, and the plan for the groups is to team up and retrieve the Ishibo, find the tree and go home together. However, Adam and Mira fall into a network of tunnels after getting ambushed by zombies, leaving Kai with group 2 and nowhere else to go. we follow Adam and Mira in the underground tunnels, and they meet a blind old man called Dave who guides them through the catacombs, he basically tells them to go find an ice castle and retrieve the Ishibo. when they get out of the tunnels, Adam sees Dave glitch in a way, he flickers, and Adam is rightfully spooked. He proposes a theory that they're in a videogame and that they need to ""win"" to go home. they get yeeted by the talking tree because they dont have the Ishibo and end up at the ice palace, where they see that group 2 and Kai are frozen in blocks of ice, with the Ishibo frozen with them. Kai escapes the ice using his firepower, and Adam tells Kai to melt the Ishibo out of the ice, but not group 2. Kai refuses as he has trust in group 2, and unfreezes them. group 2 betray them and attack Adam with the Ishibo, fatally wounding him. Vanessa insults Kai greatly and he is visibly hurt by this. they escape the ice castle and end up on the shores of a human-spider infested island. Adam is unconscious gets kidnapped along with Kai and Mira. Kai also used the last of their help from the weird guy.just before they got kidnapped, the weird guy shows up after a glitching spaceship crashes out of the sky, and tells them that the game is hella glitchy and they need to get out as soon as possible. Kai and Mira are taken to see the king spider centaur type thing, and he says he doesn't trust humans after group 2 cut off two of his legs. Kai fixes his legs, the spider heals Adam, and the trio is back on track. They ambush group 2, retrieve the Ishibo and head to the talking tree. She opens up a gateway for them, and the game is super glitchy at this point. they go to the final level, fight a dragon, jump through the portal, press a button and win the game. i tried to summarise the things that were only crucial to the storyline, i'll have missed riddles and foreshadowing for this reason, but if there's anything important i've managed to skip, please let me know. tl:dr - i honestly cant summarise the show much more than this, sorry folks"	TheHollowNetflix
New to Apex in S4, got 10 wins with each legend (stats and hopefully new player guide)	I am not good, let‚Äôs start there. I‚Äôm 42 dad with 3 kids but I wanted to get into apex to play w some friends. Everyone talks mains but I never stick w 1 character so decided to do them all. Hopefully this helps other new players decide who is ‚Äúeasier?‚Äù To start with. Win rate from best to worst and a quick new player opinion. Wide mix of ranked/pubs, 50/50 solo or in a group. 1.Pathfinder- I got the hang of his grapple pretty quick (probably from other games I‚Äôve played) and once I did wow he is so fun and strong. Imo he‚Äôs the best and a must have on every team 2. Gibby- Perfect new player legend, brings so much to the table. 3. Crypto- I‚Äôll be upfront, I watched a bunch of videos prior to playing him. He was so fun to use but unless you wanna put in time to be good with him he‚Äôs really tough to play for new players (I definitely hurt my team when I first started) 4. Revenant (after buff)- Another really good new player legend imo. Use the totem going into every fight, pretty straight forward, if you get off a bunch of damage push if not quick heal and go again 5. Caustic - Started slow but really started hitting many wins once I got a hang of his kit. Very fun to use and great for a new player that might not have positioning down 6. Bang- Good legend for new players, speed boost to get out of trouble with smoke and ult to help you position. (Just please don‚Äôt shoot the smoke at the enemy, smoke yourself to get away and heal) 7. Watson- Being able time block out some areas and eat grenades definitely won me a few games. Wasn‚Äôt a quick learn though by any means 8. Mirage - I love the decoys man, won me so many 1v1 fights. Also really good when looting boxes or figuring out where the heck you got shot from. 9. Wraith- I know how great she is but I just didn‚Äôt pick up that style quickly, the difference between an ok and good Wraith is huge. 10. Bloodhound- Great to know where people are but the ult is just not for me, too jarring of a screen change. Also I felt like people learned to react to his tactical. 11. Lifeline (played her after nerf). I don‚Äôt like support anyways and that seems to be the only thing she brings to table. It was a struggle. 12. Octane - I put up good kill games with him but just struggled to win. Late game he just doesn‚Äôt bring much imo Hope that helps someone (with less time than I) pick a legend that gets them into the game!	apexlegends

Why I ended up with Milwaukee tools	The wife and I do stuff like this on weekends. DIY, but fairly hard-core. With limited time, we don't have time for stuff to break down or not work. (I don't know how many near wrecks this little visual circus caused. Something about a porch sitting on supports made people rubberneck to the extent that they'd damn near drive into parked cars while staring.) &#x200B; [The top of this porch was pretty decent.

It‚Äôs getting hard	It‚Äôs getting really hard to believe that God loves me. I was 100% healthy my whole life. Then in 2016 everything changed and it just keeps getting worse and worse. I‚Äôve had health anxiety my whole life but I had it under control for the most part. In 2016 my mom has a stroke. She recovered fine and didn‚Äôt have any lingering effects, thank God. At the same time I had an abnormal pap which turned out to be ok and I‚Äôve had normal ones ever since. Then in 2017 I had a lump in my breast which also turned out to be nothing serious... then 2018 hit and I took my mom to the ER because we thought she was having another stroke. She tuned out to be ok again. I had some weird inverted ear drum thing which made it hard to hear but it eventually went away. At the same time my sister moved far away and a lady at work died.. then I started getting pressure in my head and I felt dizzy from it all the time... in July 2019 I ended up going to the doctor for the head pressure thing and she said it was tension headaches... so I have been dealing with that ever since. Back in October 2019 I had gotten 2 dry red patches of skin on my legs... turns out I now have nummular eczema. It did go away after using steroid cream but I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs a chronic illness and I‚Äôll have to deal with flare ups for the rest of my life... I just don‚Äôt understand what I did so wrong to deserve all of this happening to me. It feels like God hates me and isn‚Äôt even there for me. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve become so depressed.	Christian

[m4A/a] Terrible, Dreadful Feminization	A lot of gender transformation content, be it stories, captions, or comics, end with a clean-cut ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù. The guy turns female, and while at first he might hate it, he learns to love *her* new body. Things generally end alright for her, and in many cases, she‚Äôs in a better spot than when she started. This is not one of those scenarios. Something that‚Äôs always fascinated me about transformation in general is the feeling of dread and terror in can evoke. This is primarily the case in the body horror genre, but I believe it can take place in the gender transformation niche as well. Let‚Äôs be real here, if you did start to lose shrink inch by inch, wouldn‚Äôt you be worried? When your chest began to grow flabby, and latter expand outwards into blossoming breasts, wouldn‚Äôt you be at least a tad concerned? And when your memories themselves started to slip away, and you found your formerly masculine self began dreaming about lip gloss and dresses, wouldn‚Äôt terror shoot up your spine? In short, I‚Äôm interested about exploring how horrifying it‚Äôd be to go from a perfectly masculine guy into a giggly girly girl. Ideally, the transformation should be slow and drawn out; all the more time to appreciate the impending doom. If you‚Äôre interested in this sort of transformation, hit me up.

[Support] Is there any way to make the fans run at full speed during gaming?	Played Doom 2016 on my Surface, it gave good 60fps on very low but the surface heats up in 5 minutes and slows down the processor and then the fan finally runs. This heat causes the surface to cap games at 20-10 fps making them unplayable. But what if we make the fans run at max during gaming? I tried to search, but haven't found any options to make the laptop do this. Playing games at 15 fps every 5 minutes is pretty annoying. Soo please, any help would be appreciated	SurfaceGaming
Special events shouldn't count towards your overall stats and badges	Currently on the battle armor event is really easy to get your 4k damage badge, just wait for the day with level 4 or Evo armor and you will do more that 4k damage in a single game. The same happened during the Halloween event, everyone was getting their 20 kills badge because it was really easy to kill 20 shadows in a game. Respawn eventually fixed it but plenty of people got the badge. This is also bad for the overall stats, the events really mess the stats up. It would be nice if the events do NOT count towards the stats and badges so people don't cheese to get them.	apexlegends

Betting post flop with draws	Been playing a lot of $3.50 SNGs on Pokerstars. Find myself in these situations a lot and typically they get folded out (SNGs have been surprisingly nitty recently). &#x200B; 9 man SNG table, early/mid game, stacks are pretty even \*\* HOLE CARDS \*\*\* Dealt to RyeDale \[7c Qc\] UTG: calls BB HJ: calls BB Hero (CO): calls BB \*\*\* FLOP \*\*\* \[8s 6c 9c\] UTG: checks HJ: checks Hero: bets 1/2 pot UTG: folds HJ: folds &#x200B; I feel like a 1/2 pot bet on the flop signals that I've got either a 7 or XcXc and looking for an out on the turn OR I've found a pair which is also realistic given the pre flop betting and the board. My main question is should I be checking on the flop with 15(?) outs through flush + straight draws in a SNG setting and no raises? If betting is the right call here, is my sizing ok?	poker
A word to signify '5 aspects'??	Hi All I am setting up a business and need some help with names for it.

Opinion - All of the Insidious movies are good	Not saying this is unpopular, just my opinion after watching The Last Key today. Some of the movies are better than others, and there are definitely things I think each one could have done better, but none of them fall completely flat or aren't worth seeing if you enjoy any of them. Have to say I was pretty impressed that we got 3 sequels that were just as worthwile. If you like any of them, or are a fan of this brand of 2010s horror, there's four movies worth adding to your list.	horror

He was an old boy and super sweet. He wasn‚Äôt doing so well this morning, so we made a vet appointment. He passed while I was cuddling with him. My roommate was showering and we didn‚Äôt want the cat to be alone, so I stayed. He was looking right at me when he left. I‚Äôm really sad. My roommate is worse. This sucks I feel bad because I told my roommate to get ready. If I hadn‚Äôt, he would‚Äôve been with his friend when it happened. I know that‚Äôs ridiculous to think, but the thought is there.

So the Raiju‚Äôs Harness exotic Hunter chest piece got some interesting lore . . . are these new characters or de we know any more about the people involved.	Link to the lore entry: https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/raijus-harness So Raiju is, in real life, a Japanese mythological creature, being described as a white and blue wolf embodying the storm. In the Raiju‚Äôs Harness lore tab, Tohr is, presumably, a powerful Arcstrider. His corpse lies on a ‚Äústorm shrouded hill‚Äù and above it is ‚ÄúRaiju‚Äôs Maelstrom‚Äù (I do not know what this is, other than it being described as something akin to a very, very powerful source of Arc energy/storm). Tyv Lucine, whom we know very little about other than the fact that she too is an Arcstrider, works her way across the ravaged landscape to reach Tohr‚Äôs corpse. By his side is a staff, and on his chest lies the exotic in question, described as only ‚ÄúThe Harness‚Äù in the lore entry. She dons the Harness and pledges to ‚Äúlive as lightning made flesh‚Äù. I found this a very interesting and entertaining lore piece and I was wondering if we had any background on any of the things mentioned in this entry? I haven‚Äôt found any lore background on Tohr, Tyv Lucine, or the Raiju‚Äôs Maelstrom. Can anybody provide further information on these?	DestinyLore

Water temp too high in DWC?	"Ever since I switched to QB my water temps can rise to 24**¬∞**C . I've been dropping frozen bottles in one plant and leaving the other, the plant that I'm not touching seems to be healthier by a fair amount. I'm thinking that the temps rising and falling so frequently is actually worse than the hotter temps. &#x200B; My question is, should I just leave the res temps and hope for no algae? &#x200B; I'm planning on getting a water chiller eventually instead of temporary fixes.

Just discovered TMA and I. Am. Hooked!	Good Lord! I don‚Äôt understand how I didn‚Äôt find this show earlier. It‚Äôs everything I want out of a bingeable show. Every story is incredibly well-written with just the kind of surreal, cosmic body horror that gets under my skin. The meta-story, while it‚Äôs only just ramping up, is incredibly engaging. I wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd feel about other voices besides Jonathan‚Äôs coming into the fold, but I like Martin so far. I‚Äôve been listening to this show literally from morning till night. I haven‚Äôt been this sucked into a show since I discovered Twin Peaks on Netflix last year.

Would you want private lobby warzone missions?	By this I mean, say you only have 1 buddy to play with and you don‚Äôt want to be put in a warzone with 2 other random people. You would go into a private warzone mission instead of a public one, and that would put you in a warzone with just you and you‚Äôre buddy, nobody else. This leads to my next question, would you want the rest of your squad to be AI‚Äôs or just not there at all? Options to fill the squad with AI or not would be awesome because options are always great to have, but if I had to choose I‚Äôd say no AI. I bring this up because I‚Äôd personally love to do co-op warzones, and it‚Äôd be a nice challenge to take on a warzone with only 2 avengers. Using an iconic duo to play with like cap and widow, or Thor and hulk just seems fun and would force a lot more teamwork and synergy between characters that compliment each other‚Äôs skills.

New smartphones should be released every three years instead of every year.	Seriously though! A lot of these smartphone companies tout to consumers that their product lifespan is three years. Why would you say that and release another phone about a year later. This many smartphones coming out every year can't be good for the environment, plus smartphone sales are declining. Look at Samsung that sold more units last year than this year. There are extenuating circumstances I'll admit. But it can't be good for the environment to have them keep coming every year.	unpopularopinion

TIFU by buying super tampons	For background, I Always buy the same brand of Kotex U light tampons. Never had any issues. All was always well. And for TMI details, my period was finishing off, so lighter than usual but not quite finished. So yesterday I go to pee and realize I‚Äôm out of tampons. So I rush over to the store and buy the same package that I always buy, or so I thought. I open up the package and all of the tampons are in green wrappers, rather than the usual pink, blue and purple. ‚ÄúOdd‚Äù I think, but don‚Äôt bother to read the package. So I stand up, go to insert the tampon, and it felt like it stabbed me. (I didn‚Äôt get it in) ‚ÄúOW!‚Äù I scream. My boyfriend runs over and asked what is wrong. I told him that my tampon hurt me, he said that was weird and to try it again. So I guide the tampon in gently, and everything is fine. Or so I thought. I sit down on the couch and I can FEEL the tampon inside of me. It HURTS and is very uncomfortable. (You typically DONT really notice the tampon inside you) So now I‚Äôm thinking, WTF. I go and look at the package of tampons. There plastered on the front is the word ‚ÄúSUPER‚Äù fuck. I super fucked up, I never use super, and ESPECIALLY not when my period is barely there. So I go into the bathroom to take it out because I‚Äôm so uncomfortable and.... I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs stuck and it hurts like an absolute bitch. I run out into the living room with my pants around my ankles and a look of horror on my face. My boyfriend asks what‚Äôs wrong and I tell him I have a bloody super tampon stuck in me that hurts to take out. (Pun intended) So there I am in the living room trying to gently remove this tampon. Each little pull of movement BURNS in my vagina. It hurts SO BAD. My boyfriend tries to help and keeps asking if I want him to ‚Äújust pull it out.‚Äù ‚ÄúNO‚Äù I scream. After entirely way too long, I finally remove it from myself. And now the inside of my vagina feels like it has carpet burn. Joy. TL;DR - bought super tampons and one got stuck inside of me and now my vagina hurts	tifu
Would a lot of ranked problems be solved by removing the ability to duo-queue?	I do appreciate the ability to be able to climb ranked with someone else, and I think at it's core the mechanic does have a lot of benefits, but I do not think that this is outweighed by all the potentials for abuse. As someone who primarily queues alone, there is an extreme feeling that you have no agency when you're queued up against a Taric/Yi funneling duo, a duo queue where one duo member is a fresh level 30 with 100% win rate and is obviously boosting the other, or where there are two sets of duo queues on the opposing team. What do you think?	leagueoflegends

Minimalist combat boot?	Hey everybody, I was wondering if anybody knows of a minimalist combat boot? Most usually have a pretty hefty arch or higher heel in my experience. The best Ive found are a pair of Rockys which are relatively flat but have heavily padded soles. These are for garrison use by the way. Looking for coyote brown or tan or even black! Thanks!

Additive vs. Subtractive EQ	Just wondering, in the case of either getting an IEM that has more bass and reducing it via EQ, or getting an IEM that has less bass an increasing it via EQ, are either of these the more favourable option sonically? Is there any downside of one vs. the other? Would be using an ES100 for the basic EQ'ing if it's relevant.	headphones
Smoking weed after acid trip gave me a panic attack	me and my girlfriend decided to take acid together during the night to continue in and go to the back the morning after, where we drank a bit of alcohol and got home after a long ass day of soaking rays, no sleep and no food, we decided to smoke before we ate, so the food would go down better. in retrospect, it wasn't wise to drop si many substances in such short time, but anyways, shortly after, I started to believe i was acting out of my control and started having anxiety that the acid might have given me a mental illness in conjuction with the weed, which for some reason, I also believed was mixed with some type of toxic chemical. With all the stressful thoughts flooding my head, I started to shake in fear for the first time in my life as I explained this ridiculous experience to my friends which then told me what I was going through, which I had no idea was said panic attack. The morning after, I still hold some type of fear within me that quite uncomfortable .	LSD

<$1500 USD Laptop for Engineering Student	Hey all, This fall I will be starting school and majoring in engineering so I need a new laptop that can handle fairly gpu/cpu intensive CAD programs. Build quality and reliability are very important to me, as is a relatively compact size. I found on newegg this MSI p65 for $1200 USD and it seems to check all the boxes though I don‚Äôt know much about MSI‚Äôs long term reliability. https://www.newegg.com/space-gray-with-silver-diamond-cut-msi-p65-creator-9sd-1656-gaming-entertainment/p/N82E16834155442 I am also open to suggestions for other laptops that would fit the bill, so I‚Äôve filled out the form below. **LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE** * **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** $1500 MAX, preferably around $1200-1300 * **Are you open to refurbs/used?** refurbished is ok, not used * **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Performance, Battery, Form Factor, Build quality * **How important is weight and thinness to you?** not very, though as small in size as possible * **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 13-15 inch, though I prefer 14 or less * **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** CAD Programs- Solidworks and similar * **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** Only light gaming, maybe COD war zone on medium settings * **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Reliable build quality for sure. I want it to last all through college. 500 gb SSD at the minimum. * **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Reliability is key for me, though I am probably going to get an extended warranty for peace of mind.

The Evolution of the First Vision from spiritual vision to physical event.	I was reading a wiki article about the origins of the resurrection story of Christ and how it made its way into the New Testament. There is a historical consensus among non-theist scholars that the resurrection story began as very real visionary claims by the main believers in Christ. We have enough historical evidence that suggests Peter was the first disciple of Christ to receive a visionary manifestation where he saw a vision of the resurrected Christ. Mary Magdalene and several of the other apostles also have sufficient evidence for their own visionary experiences as well. Most scholars agree their experiences were much more similar to Paul‚Äôs then what is currently recorded in the New Testament. So what happened? The consensus is that these witnesses evolved over time until the New Testament gospels were written down in the form we know them today between 70-110 A.D. The first instances of these recordings were actually in the writings of Paul which were written about 20 years before the gospel of Mark which served as the template for the other gospels. In just 40 or so years the visionary experiences of the apostles evolved into the physical manifestations we read about today. A similar occurrence happened with the first vision. In every account we have of the first vision one thing is unanimous: the first vision was a spiritual vision, not a physical manifestation. There are even specific phrases in the 1832, 1838, and 1842 accounts that describe Joseph Smith awakening or coming to his natural senses after the vision had been received. The belief in the first vision as a physical manifestation is one that is uniquely tradition, taught by modern church leaders to be as real and tangible as the resurrection of Christ in the New Testament. Tracing where this teaching began is difficult and sparse, especially with the evidence we have that it was not even widely taught as a foundational experience of our faith until atleast the early 20th century. The reason for this evolution of belief is as obvious as the evolution of Christ‚Äôs resurrection: it adds legitimacy and a determined realism to the event, in a way that is definitely not shared by a spiritual vision. It‚Äôs incredibly interesting to me that this same physical legitimacy evolved in both the early Christian church and early Mormonism. Without it, it definitely makes the whole story seem a lot less real.	exmormon
it‚Äôs been 8 weeks and i‚Äôve received exactly $0 from unemployment	i‚Äôve called hundreds of times, i‚Äôve faxed in my application, i‚Äôve gone online. people who i knew before who were bumming cigarettes and money for four lokos are now buying switches that they get bored with after a month and seeking out diamond jewelry on facebook. i‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre undeserving, but they‚Äôre being so irresponsible and flaunting it. i couldn‚Äôt pay my half of the rent in may and even though my fianc√© is still working, we probably won‚Äôt make June (maybe, if his stimulus check comes in time because i can‚Äôt get ahold of former employers re: my w2s). he‚Äôs making less than these people who used to do the bare minimum to scrape by. snap benefits have been a small help, but i‚Äôm just really disheartened. life isn‚Äôt fair but i‚Äôve worked really hard to be where i‚Äôm at. i know things can‚Äôt return to normal for a long time but i really hope they open just enough not to ruin everything, both for myself and others.

Mother's Day reminder why respect is conditional on belief	"Yesterday while face-timing my mom for Mother's Day, she made a not-so-subtle remark about why me and my wife haven't had children yet. (We've been married for 6 years, and are planning on having children someday, but we both were really young when we got married, so are honestly in no rush.) After she made her remark, that basically blamed me for dragging my feet about children, she immediately countered with ""just joking, I know that having children is personal and just between you two and the Lord."" I have a fairly blunt relationship with her, so I called her out, saying that she was only joking because my response wasn't what she wanted to see. To which she agreed and that I had caught her (lol). She then started talking about babies and children and how it never gets easier to have them, and she knew someone who waited 7 years, and it was even harder for them because life ""got in the way."" And then she started passive aggressively saying that she knows that she can't tell me what to do, because once I'm told what to do, I always do the opposite. This got me thinking. I am an educated person. Got good grades, have worked hard, got a bachelor's degree, and am now in the process of getting my doctorate in medicine. My wife, incredibly bright and intelligent. Graduated college in 3 years and then completed her Master's degree before many people her same age had even finished their bachelors. Yet to my mom, I will always be the dumb teenager, stubborn child, too-independent-for-my-own good toddler. I am not the smartest of her children, (as I have some really genius siblings) therefore I will *never* know as much as them. My wife and I, have not told any family about stepping away from the church, so they all think we believe. This conversation really affected me because I know that when we finally do tell family, (which honestly will probably be when we have children and have to tell them we will not be blessing them,) I will no longer be the ""smart doctor"" that my mom loves telling her friends about. I will instantly become the stubborn child who ""isn't as smart as his other siblings, who still believe, so he has clearly been lead astray."" I know this is probably my own inferiority complex, but it still hurts. My mom has made it clear throughout my life that there is nothing I can do that will make her stop loving (which is really amazing that she set that standard since I was a child.) But while she may not stop loving me, based on past experience she will stop respecting me, which hurts almost as much."	exmormon
[PA/NY] Adopted out biological child has severe special needs, adoptive parents pushing us to help.	"My now husband and I legally gave our first child up for adoption 10 years ago to some relatives. We now are married and have a child together. Our biological child has severe autism. He is nonverbal and cannot be toilet trained, among other things. The adoptive parents obviously know who we are because we are distant relatives. This was supposed to be a semi-open adoption, but we have only seen this child twice at family functions since his birth. Since December, they've started sending out messages and phone calls that make it clear that they believe this is somehow different than a normal adoption. They now want us to assume custody and care of our first child. The only written proof we have is a few texts saying that we need to ""take responsibility"" and that I ""need to contribute more than I might have thought"" because the child isn't normal. They've insinuated on calls that he may need to come live with us soon enough. We can't afford the care this child needs, and he was legally adopted by these people at birth. What is our obligation here? We've stopped responding at all out of fear of creating an agreement or expectation, and we don't have money to just donate anyway."	legaladvice

Can Symkevi cause anxiety/depression? (M20)	I started taking Symkevi a few weeks ago, I‚Äôm on 1 twice a week and I feel it‚Äôs made my anxiety, depression, and overall motivation worse. I‚Äôve had mental issues like these for years and got therapy which helped a bit but they feel amplified since I‚Äôve been on Symkevi but it could just be a coincidence, I don‚Äôt know. Also unrelated slightly but I used to have a pretty high libido and now I hardly ever feel like doing anything sexual, I even struggle to get erections and if I do I lose them pretty fast. I was going to make an appointment with the doctors but they are only phone appointments because of Coronavirus. I have a clinic appointment in a couple of weeks with my CF team but I feel to embarrassed to bring it up with them as I see them regularly, I‚Äôd rather see a doctor about it who I won‚Äôt know for the rest of my life.

My father constantly controlls my life and life choices	"I'm male 17 and my father constantly controlls my life choices like what high school should I go to,what job would i work and I really can't go on like this.It destroys every ounce of respect I have for him.2 years ago when I had to choose what High School I should go to he made me go to a school I didn't want or like (car electrician),I said 2 other schools I wanted to go to but he wouldn't even listen he litteraly dragged me to go to that school,and when my mother says that he made me go to that school he gets offended and defensive saying that we are lying.But this thing happened today.I always loved learning languages and I already know a few languages (my native,English,German,a fair bit of Russian) and about a week ago I started learning Japanese (because since I can remember I always loved Japan and I always wanted to travel there and hopefully live there one day) and he called me on the phone and asked what am I doing,so I said learning Japanese for the next 30 minutes he was lecturing me how much useless I am,how I will never accomplish anything in my life,how retarded I am because I am learning that amount of Languages and when he finished his lecturing he said ""I don't care it's your life you are gonna destroy not mine"" and hanged up.That destroyed me,that litteraly destroyed me.I don't know what to do,I was thinking of running away from home but I don't have anywhere else to go.I need some help."	helpme

Ansiedade, Ex e Alucina√ß√£o	Em resumo, namoramos por uns 10 anos, terminamos a cerca de um ano pq comecei a fumar maconha depois que vi que ajudava com minha ansiedade. Ela acreditava que eu iria vender as coisas do ap e me tornar um drogado. Ap√≥s o termino me mudei de ap e n√£o nos vimos mais, mantive contato com a fam√≠lia a qual nunca achei que me curtissem muito mas pelo visto eu estava enganado. Ela aparentemente superou e entrou em outro relacionamento, eu ainda to me acostumando a voltar a sair e conhecer galera (ansiedade me faz ficar retardado at√© me sentir confort√°vel com pessoas novas), a algumas semanas consegui pela primeira vez chegar em alguma mina aleat√≥ria sem surtar, (isso me deixou puta empolgado). Agora o que ta me fudendo a cabe√ßa √© que ontem, me vem uma mensagem aleat√≥ria no Instagram justamente DELA, mais de ano depois. Sei l√°, fiquei sem entender a situa√ß√£o e para piorar n√£o dei bola para mensagem na hora, tentando evitar de ficar ansioso e abandonar oq tava fazendo na hora s√≥ para olhar a mensagem dela. Quando n√£o aguentei a ansiedade, fui olhar o celular para ver o que era a mensagem e ela j√° n√£o tava mais l√°. PQP agora to puta ansioso pensando se a mensagem era real ou se pra ajudar agora to alucinando, pelo visto ta na hora de voltar a psicologa. Edit TL;Dl - Terminamos, n√£o sei se a mensagem que recebi foi real ou apenas novos sintomas de transtorno psicol√≥gico.	desabafos

Anything similar to Gamma World 7e/Savage Rifts but easier to run in Roll20/VTTs?

Basically, that don't require custom dice or decks, or, in the case of Savage Rifts, such a slog through character creation?	rpg
What are your thoughts on where Siege is at currently?	I've been playing Siege since Operation Chimera. When I first started playing the game I was god awful, couldn't win a gunfight to save my life and didn't know how the game worked. I took some time away and just learned the game, watched YouTube vids from pros and popular channels to get an idea how the game worked. I came back to the game and fell in love with it, it's all I've played. Since that time I've been ranked Plat and hover around a 1.4 w/l and a 1.5kd and from where I came from when I started I was proud of that. Lately though, I've just felt apathetic to the game, playing it has been more of a chore than something I enjoy doing. Maybe I'm just burnt out from playing or just lost the joy of meeting up with my friends and getting a few games together each night. Just curious what everyone else's thoughts on the game and where it currently is? TL;DR: Used to love the game, don't really anymore. How do you feel about Siege?	Rainbow6

Ghost of Tsushima - Everything You Need to Know - Huge Info Dump	"Main stuff: - It‚Äôs an open-world samurai adventure. - The game is grounded and realistic. There's no supernatural elements in this game. - The game is a original work of fiction they are not rebuilding history stone by stone. - Ghost of Tsushima is huge ‚Äì the biggest game Sucker Punch has ever made by a wide margin. - You can play the game with a Japanese voice track. Even with a cast of mostly native Japanese speakers, they still have a dialogue coach for the game for authentic ancient Japanese. - No branching narrative - The game launches July 17th - The Game does have a photomode - Ghost of Tsushima Has Multiple Difficulty Settings - This isn‚Äôt going to be a UI heavy game - Swordplay and the horse is all mo-cap. - The composer of the game is Shigeru Umebayashi The Story : > In the late 13th century, the Mongol empire has laid waste to entire nations along their campaign to conquer the East. Tsushima Island is all that stands between mainland Japan and a massive Mongol invasion fleet led by the ruthless and cunning general, Khotun Khan. As the island burns in the wake of the first wave of the Mongol assault, samurai warrior Jin Sakai stands as one of the last surviving members of his clan. He is resolved to do whatever it takes, at any cost, to protect his people and reclaim his home. He must set aside the traditions that have shaped him as a warrior to forge a new path, the path of the Ghost, and wage an unconventional war for the freedom of Tsushima. The World : - There a lot of stories in the game that you may not find them all. - The game will feature NO waypoints - There are many side characters in the game, most which have sidequests. - Jin will learn new things from NPC quests - Each area in the game has a different theme. That reflects to different stories and narrative themes for each area. The name of the area on the demo is ""The forest of no return"". Features betrayal stories with darker tone - You will roam vast countrysides, explore billowing fields, and tranquil shrines to ancient forests, villages and stark mountainscapes,bamboo forests to the urban center of ornate castles - They want to give players alot of navigational options ,we seeing horse riding, parkour and Jin swinging with the grappling hook so far - Dynamic time of day and weather , we seeing snow, and rain areas so far - Simulated clouds. All dynamic, not painted, never going to be seen twice - Procedural skies and procedural sun break tech - If you roll around a lot in the mud you will be completely cover. If it starts raining it washes away all the mud and blood - ‚ÄúMovement‚Äù is the environment theme, expect everything to move - blowing trees, windy fields, falling leaves - If you see something and you expect to be able to climb on it, then we want you to be able to climb on it - The trailer with Masako from E3 was a side mission - Jin will change what he is wearing. In a rain-drenched part of the world Jin has traded his traditional armor for a straw raincoat called a mino. This has both mechanical value and narrative value. Combat : - The theme of the combat is ‚Äúmud, blood, and steel‚Äù. They want a feeling of intensity and danger in the combat‚Äã - Combat system can scale all the way up from a one-on-one combat with a worthy opponent all the way up to dealing with a horde of Mongols - Master the bow to eliminate distant threats with lethal precision - Develop stealth and deception tactics to disorient and ambush enemies with surprise attacks - An adaptive landscape and organic approach to combat makes Tsushima the perfect playground for mixing and matching skills, weapons, and tactics to find the perfect combat blend for your play style - As Jin‚Äôs story unfolds, versatility and creativity will become your greatest weapons. - You can customize your katana - They want every swing to feel real, so every hit that connects leave a scar. - There is a progression system. Jin has learned to use a grapple hook but this is not part of his samurai training. He‚Äôs had to learn new tricks to silently kill the Mongols - Duels in the game is going to be very narrative base they want to build the tension, each duel will be around some unique element like the red tree - The square button will swing your sword - You can kill an enemy with a single strike from the blade if you hold the triangle button and release it at the right moment - You parry with L1 - You can clean your blade with a button - Œ§he chain assassinations we seen in the trailer you must hit the button at the right time to go to the next one there is a time period - Assassinations are one of the tactics you can use. There‚Äôs a fear factor here. If you do successfully assassinate someone then it stuns the other enemies around you and gives you an opportunity to perform follow-up attacks - You can perform horseback assassinations - Weapons we seen so far, swords,bows, stun/flash bombs and big possibility of more - Where Jin stabs someone though a screen is call the Shoji assassination.

MAGA (make Amagi great again)	Amagi got nerfed too hard. It was a great ship that took some knowledge to play well. Had her on the back burner for a long time and decided to play her today. Awful, horrible. It was bad after the initial nerf, but the current state of play is especially bad for this ship. Long range HE spam really eats her up. The armor isn‚Äôt good, the guns despite being 410s are not good, speed and handling very mediocre. Was my first T7 BB. Thinking im gonna sell her though, can‚Äôt see any reason to play her over an Iowa or JB.	WoWs_Legends

For the love of god, use the wingman.	It doesn‚Äôt matter how good you think you are or how long it‚Äôll take you, the wingman is the most OP gun in the game capable of killing a red-shield enemy in 4-5 hits to the chest. What‚Äôs more it‚Äôs way more consistent than the peacekeeper. If you‚Äôre off by the slightest amount with a peacekeeper you get an 11 damage shot, the wingman fires 1 bullet that if it hits deals 45 damage, even more if it‚Äôs a headshot. AND it‚Äôs bullets slow you down. The only reason the wingman hasn‚Äôt been nerfed to oblivion is because all the people who are good at using it are the ones insisting it‚Äôs not over powered. You have no excuses not to use it, use the wingman. No matter how long it takes you to get good with it.	apexuniversity
How to make any amiibo with only an android phone	"Hey everyone! I realized that still a lot of people don't know about this, so I wanted to inform everyone that the following is the easiest way to get your dream villager. Just a reminder that the new villager like Raymond, etc. aren't able to get with this because there aren't any amiibos of them (for now). This method definitely works, I use it everyday to invite my dream villagers to my campsite! That's how I got Ankha, Stitches and other of my dreamies! You only need 2 apps from the appstore: ""Joycondroid App"" and the ""Google Files App"". I'm sadly very bad at explaining stuff, so I just tell you which tutorial I followed. It's by the account ""crossingers"" on Instagram and they have it as a story saved! It may look difficult first but trust me even I was able to do it because it's step by step and you can always rewatch it! Reminder not every android phone works as far as I now but most Samsung phones definitely work! So pls don't pay people insane amounts of bells, NMT or even real word money for villagers! I hope that some maybe get their dreamies with this method! Everybody have a great week and stay healthy!"	AnimalCrossing
Steps to take while waiting	I've been lurking in this community for a couple years now and thinking about weight loss surgery for way longer than that. Today, I finally submitted my first consultation request. I'll be self-pay. I'm hoping to schedule my surgery sometime in late summer/early fall, when hopefully COVID will be less of a concern. Right now I'm going to start phasing out soda (I'm a Diet Coke addict) and sampling all the protein shakes. Are there any other steps y'all would recommend for someone a few months away from surgery, or things you wish you'd done before surgery?	gastricsleeve

How do you keep your circulation going when in the operating room?	Hi everyone. I'm new to Reddit and I hope I'm doing this right. I'm a med student in Germany and have recently had my first surgery experiences in orthopaedics. The surgeons let me stand in the sterile area and sometimes even assist and I found it incredibly interesting. I could honestly imagine to work in this field in a few years. I just had one problem: dizziness, sometimes even syncopation. It didn't matter that much because I wasn't needed, but it shouldn't happen on a regular basis when you're a surgeon... So now I wonder if it is at all possible for me to enter a surgical field, or if I should rather pursue a career that doesn't involve operating... Do you have any general advice, experiences or opinions on this? Anything will be much appreciated, because I'm genuinely confused about what I could or should do in the next few years to come.	medizzy

[Idea] I think you would all enjoy working...	**...if it wasn't so kafkaesque**. It took me a while of practical thought to get here, but I'm logically here with my train of thought. Instinctively humans love to feel resourceful, as it is a trait carried to us from our neanderthal forefathers. However given the state of affairs that exist today (between wealth inequity and the lack of communal presence related to one‚Äôs job), we have a big portion of the population (myself included) who are anti-work. However, we still have people that enjoy playing games like ‚ÄúThe SIMS‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnimal Crossing,‚Äù we have people that love slice of life shows, such as ‚Äú[The Devil is a Part Timer](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama),‚Äù a big portion of the population who are anti-work, also enjoy the idea of work from afar. But why? I recently watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhD2rmhcBFM) video discussing a theory about ‚ÄúAnimal Crossing‚Äù. In summary, the main character is dead and you are in purgatory. The theory is is partly evidenced through the ideas that life within Animal Crossing is very simple. Work is simple, bills are simple, owning a home is simple; and life within Animal Crossing is simple because it is viewed through the objective lens of a [deceased?] child. Kafka poses that through excessive bureaucratic burdens, people are left confused in paperwork. We don‚Äôt know what's going to happen next, nor where to turn [/u/blom95], and we are stuck in this jungle of complex ideas with little ideological substance. Gone are the simpler days of working communally: as the towns blacksmith, or the state‚Äôs [teacher](https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/). Instead, are the days of working as someone‚Äôs *senior insurance claims adjuster*, woo! The aforementioned ideas parallel and describe the anti-work situation today. Work no longer provides the working individual **meaning** in their pursuits (not true for all careers, but true for most). Work is no longer a simple lifestyle, but at best, complicated. The population of anti-work is not a lazy population, but rather those who desire a simpler life.

Question about credit cards	I‚Äôm finally getting to the point where I‚Äôm almost out of debt. I have one CC through my bank (with $0 balance) and one CC that I use for recurring monthly payments (and pay off every month). The latter earns me 1% cash back for each purchase but has a $39 annual fee. I was researching other cards and rewards programs with no annual fee. Now that I‚Äôm in a much better place financially, my credit score is higher and I can probably qualify for a better CC. Anyway, the question is this: Is it better to just pay for everything in cash (debit card) or are some of these credit card rewards programs actually worth it? I was kind of interested in the ones that earn airline miles and have no annual fee. I wouldn‚Äôt be putting more than $200 on the card monthly and would pay it off each month.	debtfree

Hey, quick PSA: We're still in Stage 2 of reopening. We haven't magically moved to Stage 5 yet.	Sick of seeing so many people out and about, back on with their normal lives. As if we all got bored of COVID so decided it was over. The lifting is based on the hospital's ability to handle the virus through beds and ventilators, not based on the virus being somehow eradicated in our state. You could still get it. Your chances are still high. The difference is that you'll have a hospital bed to die in versus being turned away due to capacity. Here's a handy guide.

How do you know if an activity is productive or a waste of time?	So for quarantine I tried to catch up on watching documentaries on Netflix. I thought it was really productive at first but then I realized I might be wasting my time because I've been binging them. I now moved to reading history and philosophy books. Again, been really productive at first, but I don't know at what number of finished books would I start calling it a waste of time because I've been spending my whole day reading. I realized if I spend a hundred hours reading German history, I wouldn't practically use them in any way in my life. What makes it any different from sleeping all day, watching reality shows or playing video games? Same thing with learning languages. I've been casually studying Korean and Russian since 2 years ago, spent a lot of hours, yet I'm in no way planning on living in those countries anytime in the future. I always thought I'm being productive by learning about anything but I can't help but think there's no practical use to all of this.	productivity

Anyone else feel like the game rewards disrespect?	When I say disrespect I mean mashing buttons (especially uppercut) after being negative. I feel like it's part of the meta, and works more than it should. However, (tired of saying it) there are some characters blessed with 9 frame mids, and you don't dare disrespect a character who has one. I believe it creates a big imbalance with the game, forcing characters without fast mid hitting strings to work a lot harder to win, whether as characters like Liu Kang cannot be disrespected, and in turn have a lot more control over their opponent. In a sense, there is no such THING as having a turn in this game, it's just mash fest sometimes, and your opponent has an advantage if your character doesn't have a fast, mid hitting string. Please tell me what you think, I've been trying to understand what it is I don't like about this game and this is the theory i'm leaning towards.	MortalKombat

Are evictions a thing yet?	I remembered reading that the evictions moratorium expired at the end of April and I did some digging through old news articles which confirmed that the evictions moratorium ended April 26th. Does anyone know if that got extended? Are evictions only being held up by the fact that courts are closed right now? I think the CARES act bans evictions on certain properties through June (estimated to effect about 25% of renters who have federally backed rental agreements or whose landlords used certain federal programs).	rva

You Have No Idea What Impact Your Writing Is Having	I don‚Äôt know if this post *belongs* here or not, but I really thought it was something worth sharing with the folks here. I‚Äôm a former book editor (now full-time freelancer). I worked for a small trade publisher in suburban Chicago. We had some ‚Äúhits,‚Äù but most of our books most people wouldn‚Äôt know. Anyway, lately I‚Äôve been feeling nostalgic and I looked up some of the authors I worked with in the past, just to see what they were up to these days. And I looked up an author who had pitched me several fantasy novels that I really really liked but could not convince my boss to buy. Her writing captivated me. To the point that I called her up every now and then to see if she was working on anything new, anything that might work better for our list. She lived out in the woods, in a trailer (I think), but she always told me about all of the injured/stray animals she was taking in. She was just scraping by with odd writing jobs, teaching and speaking at fantasy-writing conferences. She sold a *Star Trek: Next Generation* novel and a couple of fantasies to a paperback publisher. But despite my efforts, we were never able to come up with something new that would work for my employer. Her name was Rebecca Neason. And I just learned that she died several years ago, after dealing with a chronic illness. As far as I can tell, she never published the book she‚Äôd submitted to me, the book she was so passionate about. I don‚Äôt think she published anything beyond the books I was already familiar with, books that are on my shelves even now. And I feel unusually emotional about the fact that she is no longer in the world. Who she was as a writer, a person, made a powerful impression on me that I am not going to forget. It‚Äôs easy to think that editors and agents are faceless beings who exist only to say no or to impede our dreams. As writers, it‚Äôs easy to assume that we‚Äôre just names on a manuscript. But I‚Äôm convinced that if we take the time to put a bit of who we are into what we write‚Äîwhatever that might be‚Äîit is going to resonate with readers. Maybe it will sell; maybe it won‚Äôt. But maybe it will open the door to something else, something unexpected and even life changing.	writing
I messed up my settings... lapses now at 6 days?	"So I wasn't happy with my settings and decided to mess around with them. I decided to use Anking's settings and I took off my load balancer. Now, all of my cards that I've missed have the ""good"" interval of 6 days and an ""easy"" interval of anywhere from 1 - 6 days, which confuses the hell out of me. I would want the cards I clicked ""again"" on to show up the next day and then if I get them right, bump them to their around their normal spacing. For example, a card that I get wrong that was originally 6months, now will be like 1.4 months or something. &#x200B; &#x200B; [What is happening?!?](https://preview.redd.it/r63lnrnvg5y41.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=47e5f0f563d78617e76a0f6d9c889c8cf146a4a7) &#x200B; Does this make any sense?

Actual Size of PS5's SSD	"Let's start with some facts beforehand: * 1 TB or (1,000,000,000,000 Bytes) is advertised as so, but its capacity is reported as 930 GiB. We'll simply refer to this as 930 GB from hereon * Similarly, 500 GB ""advertised"" is allocated as 465 GB of space * PS4's OS (Operating System and Services) [eats up around ~57 GB of space](https://www.ps4storage.com/blog/?p=23) * Let's assume, PS5's more advanced and more-feature-heavy (read: bloated with more default apps) OS will eat up 75 GB of space Doing the math: * 825 GB advertised SSD ~= 768 GB of space * 768 - 75 GB (PS5 OS) = **693 GB** of free remaining space. How would you feel about having only 600-something GB of space in your console in 2021? Enough space to hold a couple of games, movies, music? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments."

Anyone else having an issue with team chat on Xbox?	Lately any time I join team chat, it shows multiple other players in team chat but I hear nothing. Now usually I would say that they're just being quiet, but when I speak I don't have the icon in the top corner showing that I am saying anything. Mic isn't muted and all settings are correct.

What's your favourite repeated motif in a song?	I thought I would get sick of the four piano notes that are in almost all forty one minutes of Fishmans' Long Season but I loved to see its sound becoming warped in the second phase, disappearing for a bit in the fourth phase to make way for the violin, and making its return to contribute in the gorgeous, emotional finale. So, what are your favourite, best executed motifs in music?	LetsTalkMusic
Should I abandon my best friend?	My ex and I broke up a few months ago. It was somewhat mutual, really heart breaking between us, but we wanted to be friends. Before the break up I noticed my best friend and her had some sexual tension, and I told my best friend that if he were to do anything it would make things a hell of a lot harder to be friends with my ex. He said he would never do anything... Few weeks later I found out they slept together AFTER I had the conversation with him. After a lot of anger and discussion I cooled down and forgave both of them. Now we both have met this girl through a common hobby, and she's really awesome. I told my friend that I'm interested in pursuing her and would like to take lead with her. He agreed and said he'd be my wingman. But I'm starting to realize he's flirting with her, texting her constantly and once basically butted into plans I had made with her. I feel she might be more interested in him, which is fine by me, it's not my decision. But the fact my friend told me he'd back off, but clearly didn't is infuriating the hell out of me. This would be the second time he has taken priority of getting his dick wet over our 14 year friendship. Am I in the wrong for feeling so angry? I just feel I can no longer trust and feel anger towards him everytime I talk with him. I'm kind of tired of feeling this way and need to know whether I should suck it up or maybe I should take a step back.	Advice
I‚Äôm becoming so confused about my sexuality and becoming more and more convinced I‚Äôm lesbian	i came out as bi to some school friends a couple months ago and they accepted me. the other day i was laying on my bed listening to ‚Äúgirl in red‚Äù and i began thinking about my sexuality. the more i think about it, the more sex with a guy freaks me out. i am still a virgin, but i‚Äôm terrified of the thought of having sex with a guy. sex with a girl is becoming more and more appealing to me, and i‚Äôve always wanted a relationship with a girl more than a relationship with a guy. regularly, any type of sexual/romantic thoughts are always about girls, not guys. never. i‚Äôve had boy crushes as a child but i also had lots of girl crushes on various cartoon characters, so i‚Äôve just been assuming i was bi up until this point. the older i get, the less i think about guys. i still think guys are attractive sometimes, but i‚Äôm being pulled more and more towards girls. my family is homophobic, so they do not know that all of this is going on inside my head. please don‚Äôt judge me, it feels so good to write about it.	offmychest
How would you simplify Pathfinder for a bunch of total newbies?	Quarantine has hit my country and I'm currently stuck alone, having no-one else to speak to except my neighbours who would be interested to play some TTRPGs but they want to play something simple. Problem: I only have Pathfinder 1e and it's the only system I know. I'm aware it can be too complicated of a system to introduce total newbies to the hobby so I'm looking for ways to streamline the game accordingly. What rules should I ignore? What should I change to make it easier to learn? Extra infos: I only have the core rulebooks.	Pathfinder_RPG

Did Forest Gump Play Disc Golf?	I watched Forest Gump again last night from start to finish. In the opening scene of he tucks the feather into a book (Curious George?) in his suitcase. In the top of the suitcase, held in place by the net, looks to be a golf disc? A driver at that. I can't imagine why. Unless Hanks or the props guy is a disc fan and was slipping in a personal bit. The thing is flat and round. There's a tube of toothpaste next to it, but I can't think of an item of personal hygiene that would look like that. I'm pretty certain Savannah didn't have a disc golf course at the time the movie took place. (We used to play in a town park.) Edit: Of course it's the paddle. After disc popped in my head, it didn't leave room for anything else.	movies

My opinion of the Ryzen 4000 series and B450 drama.	i'll probably get downvoted but here it goes! The decision was stupid but has some upsides to it. Zen 3 is gonna be awesome and B550 motherboards will be good aswell. But the part that actually pisses me off about the whole situation is that if you want to upgrade from any AM4 CPU, you gotta pay atleast an extra $100 USD to get a good motherboard. And the CPUs will be more expensive than last gen (obviously) making you spend between $400-600 for an upgrade. This is stupid. This is just AMD doing an Intel and trying to squeeze as much money as possible. The B550 motherboard is gonna be around the same price as the B450 and maybe even last up until 2 or three more generations Ryzen Processors. But who is seriously gonna upgrade from 3rd to 4th gen immediately, You are most likely upgrading to it if you are upgrading from 2nd Ryzen CPUs and below. Zen 2 is already awesome so why waste money and wait for prices to go down. It is unneeded. The 3rd gen of Ryzen is fantastic and I will imagine people will keep on buying Processors like the 3600 and 3700x for a while. The 3600 alone is just fantastic, personally I don't own one but my good friend does and when it's paired with an RTX 2000's series or a Navi GPU, it run's so good. 3rd gen owners and B450 owners, especially 3600 owners, please just upgrade to a better CPU within the Zen 2. architecture. I can only see processors being bought by people who are making a brand new pc or upgrading from old hardware. The better part about this is the 3000 series CPUs will go down in price and maybe even B450 motherboards which is fantastic. I disagree with AMD here but just look on the bright side of things guys.

Quarantine has been PRODUCTIVE! 4 WORKS ON WATTPAD	For over 20 years I've written works without compiling them into one place.During quarantine I've put my written works together and have now 4 works (2 complete) going on Wattpad with new works being updated DAILY as I still have tons to go through. My writing goal has always been working within my own created Universe. My writing revolves around dark fantasy and neo-noir elements that I have molded into a world that highlights the struggles between the Fallen and Divine. I am also lucky to have the very talented Vanessa Trueba [https://www.instagram.com/nessa\_ninona/](https://www.instagram.com/nessa_ninona/) lending her talents for my Revelations series with chapters from Book III finally being uploaded after a 7 year hiatus.

Halfords said their rear dashcam doubles up as a reversing camera. It does not. What can I do?	I am fucking livid. I went to Halfords and asked them to install a stereo, and asked for them to install a rear dashcam that can be used as a reversing camera too. They said the [HDC 400](https://www.halfords.com/technology/dash-cams/halfords-hdc400-dash-cam-535333.html) + [HDC-R](https://www.halfords.com/technology/dash-cams/halfords-hdc-r-rear-dash-cam-535341.html) was a great option. All in all I paid like ¬£600, went to reverse and the camera didn't come on the screen. Went back to Halfords a few days later and they told me it's not a reversing camera. I am fucking livid because I've already paid for it all. Is there anything I can do? They just said it's my problem and I can buy another reversing camera and pay for installation again.	AskUK

If Pok√©mon GO launched with the features that exist today, it would have been deemed the greatest game of all time.	"When GO first came out, it was an unfathomable change. I had never imagined that a game would get everyone out into the world and exploring. To me it was literally the Pok√©mon adventure I'd dreamed of having. Pok√©mon has drifted in and out of my life since I was 5 and it's always been a standout for me, even though I am generally disinterested in other turn-based games. For me and a lot of others, I considered Pok√©mon GO as the best game I had ever played, at the time that it was released. I was so lost in the excitement of the experience that I ignored the faults and persisted through the failures. It was magical. I'll always remember jumping over golf course fences and running across greens with sprinklers on to catch a wild Dragonite at 4am. And skateboarding a km off course to catch a wild Snorlax on the way to a job interview that I was already late for. And running back and forth between gyms for 6 hours battling against spoofers just to maintain my pride. If the features that are present in the game today were available at launch, I think that Pok√©mon GO would have been even bigger and for even longer. I think this game would have been arguably crowned the GOAT. Or at least the most revolutionary game ever. Don't get me wrong, this game has a thriving playerbase with a wealth of highly entertaining content. And I still rate the experience as the single greatest gaming phenomenon that I've ever lived through. But to the general public, this game was huge at launch, was a bit light on content and fizzled out, slowly becoming a ""dead game"". What do you think? If the game was more complete back when it launched, would the hype have been enough to see Pok√©mon GO considered as the greatest game of all time?"	pokemongo
Best LI?	So the first time round I played this series (and am currently doing so) I played with Liam. He seemed like the best choice considering the first two books were the whole point MC was there. And he really cares about her. But I felt like her and drake had unfinished business. So I played second time round with him... Sometimes I feel like MC, drake and Liam are still in a triangle of sorts. MC and Liam are still treated like they are a couple, and do all the press events together, and Drake seems to be MC‚Äôs side man. Like them being together is only a thing behind closed doors. It‚Äôs weird. And then for Liam to suddenly pass on the royal line to the woman he loved whim broke his heart just seems like a really weird situation. It‚Äôs weird. ITS ALL JUST REALLY WEIRD I more like Hana as a best friend that a love interest. Tbh the story seems to flow with Liam. Who do you guys think is the best LI in general and in terms of the storyline??	Choices

Height Problem	"5'5"" , 140.8 lbs, 13.5M, mostly Mexican (like 95%), no past medical issues. Uses prescribed acne cream and otc nasal spray, exposed to second hand smoke from dad, doesn't smoke. Ok so, last year in the puberty class thing, they said that I would be going through a growth spurt for 24-36 months. I started puberty when I was 11ish and I went through a growth spurt when I was 12 that only lasted around 5 months. It brought me from 5'1"" to 5'5"", and I haven't grown since. I took one of those ""what stage of puberty am I in?"" Quizzes online and it said that I was pretty much done and should be like 5'10"". I have pubic, armpit, facial, butt, leg, arm, and bottom of chest hair. My voice is pretty deep and I'm the average penis size. My mom is 5'6"" and my dad is 5'8"". I recently put on 10 lbs in like a day, but my stature (pretty skinny) didn't change, I've also been eating slightly more than normal and have been sleeping longer by like 30 minutes, and I also have slightly long arms and legs, so these MIGHT be signs of growing talle but I don't know. So, am I done growing taller, or do I still have the rest of the growth spurt later on into my teen years?"	AskDocs

Pipe-trinket magic item?	"Hello! So I've just started my run of CoS, and thanks to you guys, it's going great! Now, at the very start, I ran the little skeleton horse encounter, and had it drop a trinket behind- the pipe that makes skull-smoke. I put it in just to increase the mystery somewhat, but one of my players got really attached to it, and keeps blowing it near any source of drama, danger, or mystery, and asking things like ""Where does the skull go?"" Now, I really do like the idea of it being a fluff- common and fairly useless magic item, so I'm allowing him, at the party's next long rest, to try to identify it. You guys are so much better at this stuff than I am, so I'm asking you; what small, but cool feature could I give this thing? NB: the party has been playing really well together, and I'd really like to throw in a smattering of little rewards to them, this isn't a case of a whiny player begging for a magic item, rather a well developed character indulging his curiosity, which I would like to reward."

I had my first ‚Äú*facepalm* It‚Äôs just a (insert object‚Äù last session.	TL;DR: one of my players got paranoid over a rock because he kept rolling high on investigation. A couple of my players like to role play making breakfast for everyone after camping so as usual they were cooking up eggs and bacon and what not and our (VERY paranoid) gunslinger asked if there was anything he could do to help. He was asked to go out and find some herbs. Easy enough. Well he rolled a nat 20 on his investigation check so I thought I‚Äôd throw in a little bit extra for him ‚ÄúYou find plenty of chives and basil and what not and you find a cool looking rock.‚Äù Figuring he would either not take it or not think anything more of it and just take it, I didn‚Äôt go into much detail. GS: ‚ÄúA cool looking rock? What does it look like?‚Äù At this point I had to pull something out of my ass and I remembered the sailor thing where rocks with a hole in it are seen as good luck. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the size of a half dollar. It‚Äôs smooth. And it has a hole in it.‚Äù GS:‚ÄùWait it has a hole in it? Was it like drilled in?‚Äù At this point I‚Äôm getting the vibe that he‚Äôs definitely reading into this way more than I was planning. So I‚Äôm gonna have some fun with this. One low investigation check later and he can‚Äôt tell if it was drilled or just looks like that. GS: ‚ÄúCan I see if there are any like, keyholes or anything that this might fit into?‚Äù Oh boy. Roll Investigation. GS: ‚ÄúNatural 20!‚Äù Thank god we were over discord or else they would‚Äôve have seen the biggest shit eating grin on my face. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt find anything that this might fit into. But you do notice that this rock looks a lot different than the other rocks in this area. It‚Äôs too smooth to really be from this area.‚Äù He then very carefully pocketed it and voiced his concern about it to me and I had to mute myself to hide my laughter.	DnD

Advice on Rebuilding Sense of Security	My husband and I have been married for 3.5 years and from the outset, chose the Venn diagram model for finances: personal accounts and then a shared one for mutual expenses. I was never a huge fan of the idea: I thought it was fine to have personal accounts but that the majority of funds should be combined. My husband felt differently. Fast to yesterday when there was a catalyst for me to bring up my discomfort with our financial arrangement. We both make good salaries‚Äîbut my husband makes more than 2.5x what I make and contributes only a little more to our shared fund, keeping most of it private. It finally came out that he has a fear that I will leave him and doesn‚Äôt want to be left with nothing. This was devastating to me‚Äîan indictment on our trust, in addition to casting a shadow of ‚Äúself-fulfilling prophecy‚Äù on our marriage. But most of all, it was confirmation that there is deep insecurity for both of us about our marriage. So my question is this: we both recognize this insecurity and want to repair it. Have you experienced this? What did you do to improve it?	Marriage

Any inside office staffers here?	I know a lot of people here are either drivers or package handlers and I know you guys are physically exhausted, I feel for you. I'm in the office - Senior Office Admin - I know a lot of stations have at least one and I am mentally exhausted. The amount of stuff going on behind the scenes is never ending - 6 days a week is running me down, or working 10 hour days to not come in on a Sat or Sun has been saving my sanity a bit. The amount of supplies, vendor issues, invoicing, interviews, onboarding, code 85s, missing packages, disputes, etc. I get home and I'm ready to pass out by 7:30pm. I just want you to know (PHs and Drivers) you're not alone. It's exhausting in many different ways for a lot of us. I hope there is a light at the end of the tunnel for a bit of a slow down, but i'm not sure when that will ever happen. I see a lot of you ask questions on here and hopefully I can help you some how, sometimes It's nice to get out of my daily routine and help others when I can. But, don't think I haven't been there, I've loaded trucks (oh Purple Carrot), acted as a jumper/helper with drivers and tried many different departments at FedEx Ground, it's draining all around.

Is Modi Government paying 85% rail fare for migrant laborers?	I am reading lots of conflicting news about the railway ticket fare for migrants workers. The BJP government [claims](https://twitter.com/sambitswaraj/status/1257156770386055170) that they are subsidizing 85 percent of the fare and states could pay the rest. While Punjab IAS officer [says](https://twitter.com/kbssidhu1961/status/1257672857015816192) that the Punjab state is paying 100% instead of 15% they were supposed to pay. Modi government has also [refused](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/modi-govt-refuses-to-tell-supreme-court-if-it-is-paying-85-rail-fare-for-migrant-labourers) to give a breakdown of ticket fares to the Supreme Court which would have cleared some air on how much is central government and state government paying. If they are not revealing the breakdown then its simply a big fat lie to gain some social points.	india
It's been just over a year and I still can't get over my ex who left me for someone else, I think I need help.	Me and my ex were together for 10 years but towards the end she became distant and started speaking with this guy from work a lot. She then left me, when she did I asked if it was because of someone else and she said no, but then one week later she was with him posting pictures everywhere and making it official. I immediately went no contact and have done since, literally haven't seen or heard anything about her, but it's been over a year now and I still can't stop thinking about her all the time, it's actually mainly the thought of them together and how she was cheating on me when I didn't even realise, there's a whole other layer to this! I really want to be able to get over this, but as I said I can't stop thinking about the betrayal, is it normal to hate someone this much but still think about them each day a year later and the good times we used to have? I've tried counselling and other methods to get help, but nothing has worked.	relationship_advice

John says he liked other Paul compositions (November 1973)	"All too often I see trashy articles claiming that the only McCartney number Lennon had any respect for was Here, There and Everywhere. In an interview with Chris Charlesworth (originally published in Melody Maker on 3rd November 1973) to promote Mind Games, Lennon's states; ""I have a favourite of Paul's... Of Paul's I like 'Here, There and Everywhere'... Of course I still like 'Eleanor Rigby', and another was 'For No One.'"" Bet this isn't even the only example. All I want is the truth."	beatles

What is the scientific evidence that caffeine withdrawal lasts longer than 7-12 days?	I see a lot of claims on here that there are effects that go on months after quitting caffeine and that they need to wait months to see the full benefits. Is there any evidence of this or is it just an assumption based on the fact that caffeine affects brain chemicals?	decaf

How to make any amiibo with only an android phone	"Hey everyone! I realized that still a lot of people don't know about this, so I wanted to inform everyone that the following is the easiest way to get your dream villager. Just a reminder that the new villager like Raymond, etc. aren't able to get with this because there aren't any amiibos of them (for now). This method definitely works, I use it everyday to invite my dream villagers to my campsite! That's how I got Ankha, Stitches and other of my dreamies! You only need 2 apps from the appstore: ""Joycondroid App"" and the ""Google Files App"". I'm sadly very bad at explaining stuff, so I just tell you which tutorial I followed. It's by the account ""crossingers"" on Instagram and they have it as a story saved! It may look difficult first but trust me even I was able to do it because it's step by step and you can always rewatch it! Reminder not every android phone works as far as I now but most Samsung phones definitely work! So pls don't pay people insane amounts of bells, NMT or even real word money for villagers! I hope that some maybe get their dreamies with this method! Everybody have a great week and stay healthy!"	AnimalCrossing
4k Watch Hours: check , 1k Subs: Uh?	Yay! I now have 4k watch hours (within last 12 months), but in terms of subscribers, I am still not halfway there.

My heart breaks seeing my stepson grieve the loss of his mom. What else can I do to help?	My SS lost his mom when he was 3 years old and he is now 7. She had been in and out while she was still here but all of his memories of her are good ones, which is good. With yesterday being Mother's day, naturally it stirred up some feelings in him. I've never seen him break down about anything like he did last night saying he missed his mom. My husband consoled him and let him know she's always with him and she's so proud of him and things of that nature. He perked back up for a little bit but then at the dinner table he just couldn't hold it together anymore. We were all in tears at that point. It broke my heart and I can't even imagine what he feels since I've never had a loss that big in my own life. He began asking questions about her death (she overdosed) and you can tell he's just trying to put it all together. I did eventually excuse myself to give him and his dad some alone time to talk. I felt torn about that decision but I just felt they needed a moment together. Once they were done, my SS came to me and I asked him to come give me a hug. I pulled him up onto my lap and squeezed him and he asked why I had cried at the dinner table too. I told him that it hurts me to see him hurting because I love him so much. I let him know that I know I'll never be able to replace his mom but I will always love and protect him for her, that I didn't give him the gift of life but life has given me the gift of him, that he can always talk to me about anything, etc. He said that he is happy he gets to have two mom's, he's the sweetest boy. I'm looking for any and all suggestions on how to help him. I know the pain of her absence will always be there, but how can we make it easier? I recently asked his mom's mom for pictures so we can have some pictures of him and her together in the house. I thought about creating a picture/memory book for him to look through when he misses her. I just don't know what to do. FWIW; I had added my husband and SS on our insurance this year so we could get him some grief counseling but I have since been laid off due to COVID so therapy just isn't an option at this time.	stepparents
How would you attach a baby gate to these stairs?	Our 9-month-old has started crawling up a storm so we‚Äôre making up for lost time child-proofing our home.

I‚Äôm thinking I need to attach a piece of wood (2x2? 2x4?) on the right and then span across? Would ordinary drywall screws suffice?

M22 Why does shitty behavior not turn me off to women I‚Äôm attracted to?	I‚Äôve noticed that when looking for partners, that whenever I catch someone that I like a lot doing something that I think is bad, I don‚Äôt lose any attraction to them whatsoever. Say I catch them lying to me, or I find them behaving rudely to someone who doesn‚Äôt deserve it often, etc.... Usually when this happens my attraction for that person doesn‚Äôt waver a even little. I feel as though this could keep me from seeing red flags in potential because I‚Äôll get stuck with rose colored glasses on. Is this normal? Is there a way I can eliminate this?	dating_advice
Day 1 and I Am Broken	"**Right now I am broken. Broken up with and broken down. This is a record of my efforts to turn the extraordinary pain of heartbreak into something better and good so that one day I may be put back together.** I've always wanted to try and write a bit but I've been hindered by the fact that I am self-aware enough to know that I am not very good at it. This is the only time as an adult that I haven't been too self-conscious to write something that may be read by others\*. Right now I hurt too much to cringe so I am taking advantage. Silver linings. I tried to start something yesterday on Instagram but it wasn't right. I thought maybe if I just started doing a self-portrait every day from now until forever I'd feel better. But doing one reminded me that I am vain and that the first time around I only really got any pleasure when they were good, I can't be putting that pressure on myself now or there's a chance that I will crumble further (and maybe turn from crumbs to dust). I better explain the pain more fully before I start banging on about all of the things that I will do that will mean that one day I will be able to look back and say that it was pain but that it was ok (and mean it). Yesterday was day 0 It was sunny and I woke up late knowing I had no work that needed doing, just meetings in the morning and then a run. I am horribly unfit right now and running is not the joy it once was but little more than an unpleasant reminder of how far I've let things slide. Feeling myself flop sloppily around in a way I couldn't have done six months ago and rasp and gasp for air like a newly fished fish - it was not fun. But still, I do it and am glad I am doing it and thinking of a future me that is more like old running me but also happy like current me. Because yesterday, current me was happy. She was in love and thought that she was loved. I'd asked him for an album to listen to whilst I ran as I am shit with music and he is not. I can see now that his response was off, as too was the answer when I announced post-run that I would be coming over to his to work in the afternoon (our usual routine). Only off in small ways but no pet names, nothing extra - looking back it is all so clear. I was oblivious though and feeling fine and bouncy when I left my flat for his, I'd worn proper clothes for once, a loose red dress, even earrings and red lips to match. It's almost like I knew - dressing up so that at least I'd look good in that one scene that I'll probably replay more times than any other. He said ""We need to talk about this"" as if the ""about this"" would distract me from what we all know that means. It didn't distract me and I was totally overcome with dread. I accused him of being about to do exactly what he was about to do knowing the answer and knowing what it would mean for me. Before this, I really thought that I'd found my answer, after twenty-eight long years of looking, of trying, of desperately and so sadly searching. I thought that I'd done it, that I had things fixed. That I was going to be fine no matter what because I'd found that one person who makes everything fine. And now he was sitting beside me telling me I'd got it wrong, so wrong. To be quite honest, on this - day one, I still don't believe him. I hope I will come to believe it, that one day I won't look at this as the time that I missed out on my one chance of happiness but right now this is how it seems. So yeah. That's the backstory, or the end of it rather. Of course, the real backstory is the love itself. Maybe that will come with time. The question I'm grappling with now is how to make this ok. Not that I am trying to be too healthy about it or anything. I haven't eaten since Tuesday and I am currently sipping (gulping down) my third ""gin and water and frozen berries"" and it is not even 4pm, so don't fear - I am doing heartbreak completely and utterly properly. I just also do have this drive to make sure that I am doing something that I wouldn't be if I was still happy and in love. So firstly I am writing this which is something I would never have done were I still with him - not just for lack of material but also because I would have feared his judgement and been self-conscious. And secondly I will set myself goals here, very clear goals and I will be accountable because even though no-one will read this, it will be public and it will be here. Goal 1: Post a blog post here every day for a week. (Let's start small) \*I am also self-aware enough to know that no-one will actually read this which is making the whole thing quite a lot easier. [I'm writing here everyday and maybe it is helping.](https://www.brokendown.org/post/day-1-and-i-am-broken)"	BreakUps
Nobody supports my weight loss	Before university I(F22) was around 58-62kg (127-137 pounds). I was not too skinny, I‚Äôm 1.78m (~5‚Äô10) because I have never exercised so you know I look a bit thinner than avarage but nothing else. After 6-8 months in university I gained a lot of weight and was around 72-75kg (158-165pounds). I drunk a lot, ate really unhealthy and didn‚Äôt do anything at all. I felt bad and I could see how much I‚Äôve gained. In March when I had to move back home I started a diet and now I‚Äôm 65kg (143pounds) and I‚Äôm really happy about it! I feel more energetic and healthy, I look much better, my skin is glowing. I plan to be 58kg again (127pounds) and I work hard for this. My family and my boyfriend are mad. They said I look better when I had a little more weight on and I‚Äôm going to be too skinny and will not have any booty or breast. They always make rude comments on me and don‚Äôt care about that I feel better. I feel horrible that no one is happy about me feeling better and healthier and achieving this. (Like self and portion control are really hard and all my respect for those who lose a lot of weight). They always buy me something that they know I can‚Äôt eat. IMPORTANT! I don‚Äôt have any mental illness, I don‚Äôt see myself fat or anything I just like how fit and healthy I am starting to become.	offmychest

Interpreting the six ghost kids personalities.	We have basically nothing on their canon personalities, and maybe never will at this rate. So here's a collection of headcanons based on their behavior in the games. Feel free to add your own in the comments. Also I'm going with Cassidy possessing Golden Freddy, mainly because I'm sick of BV as a character. * **Jeremy** is always the first to try killing the nightguard and is the most persistent. From this, I'd say he's impatient and impulsive. He has the least qualms with killing nightguards, and may actively enjoy it the most. When he's backstage or in the west hall, he'll look into the camera with a demonic grin and a smug side eye respectively. This shows Jeremy is the most mischievous. Maybe he doesn't take any of this seriously and just wants something to do, at least in the beginning of the week. By possessing Bonnie, he has access to a usable guitar. Its likely he's played around with it many times, he might have even memorized a song or two. * **Susie** seems to be the least interested in this whole killing business. She wanders around the building in a daze and stares at the guard through the window for long periods. She goes along with it like the others, but I think Susie is troubled with what she's doing. I've seen it speculated that the clanking you hear in the kitchen is Susie trying to cook food. Given how sporadic the noises are, I see it as her banging pots and pans together as a form of stress relief. But I can see her making little snacks with the leftover ingredients when there's no nightguard to worry about. She's portrayed in Help Wanted as an active eater. Whether or not she can taste the food, I think she does it in order to feel more human. * **Fritz** is a very lonely kid. Being cooped up in a little stage separate from his friends for the majority of the day has taken a toll on him. Not to mention that he could be annoyed by the obnoxious pirate gimmick. Fritz is shy, nervous, and a little twitchy. His nerves can be seen with him frantically banging on the door in frustration. Perhaps the reason he attacks if you don't keep an eye on him is he doesn't like being left alone with himself and his thoughts. Then there's his signature run into the office. This is probably a stretch, but I like to think that Fritz was the athletic type when he was alive. Specifically a runner who did really well in track. As for UCN, Jeremy being present in his stage could represent that the two are very close friends. * **Gabriel** likes to be hidden. Most of the time he lurks in the shadows and is always the one to kill you when the power runs out. This is harder to interpret than the others, but I would guess that he's a somber child, more thoughtful and a bit distant. He's the only other person seen in the kitchen, so I like to imagine that he's become Susie's assistant while she's cooking. As for his lack of activity in the first two nights, I have my own theory. If we tie this in with him seemingly waking up in the middle of the night during the FNAF 2 cutscenes, as well as following Charlie while everyone else looks to be asleep in the save them minigame, I would say that Gabriel has some kind of sleeping problem. This could be caused by him possessing the mascot character, and as such getting more unwanted attention during performances. His inactivity is an attempt at getting some needed rest before trying to confront the nightguard. Help Wanted implies that he, like Charlie, is very attached to his music box. * **Cassidy** is an enigma, to say the least. She doesn't have any ongoing strategy like the others, instead choosing to pop out at random for an instant kill. Her suit not having an endoskeleton means she's capable of more supernatural abilities. During her encounter with Gabriel, she appears to be floating off the ground, or at least manipulating her suit into standing. She can teleport, disappear, and somehow send the phantom image of her head to kill people. I also find it interesting that after phone guy is dead, Cassidy seems to have recorded her own message on the phone. What she's saying is anyone's guess. In UCN, I don't think she created William's hell, but rather stumbled upon it and decided to make herself it's guardian. As such, some of her memories and perceptions of her time at Freddy's take form as William's tormentors. This is seen best with her depiction of Charlie, who she doesn't seem to have the fondest memories of. I imagine that the others see her as a very difficult person to try to talk to or console, as she prefers to be alone most of the time. * **Charlie** is arrogant and boastful. Even before her murder, it's likely being the daughter of the man who co-founded Freddy's led to a lot of bragging. After her death and possessing the Puppet, she spent a good few years completely alone with no one to talk to. This led to intense feelings of loneliness and frustration. Given that she knew William was the one that killed her, Charlie's desire to murder comes entirely from wanting to take out these emotions on others regardless of their actions. In a similar vein, her decision to attach the kid's souls to the robots is less about getting revenge on William and more to do with her wanting friends. Whether or not she actually gets along with them is debatable (especially Cassidy). Amidst the chaos, the one thing that can bring her instant comfort and security is the gentle melody of the music box.	fivenightsatfreddys
Had a very creepy SP experience/ dream	So last night I woke up and I was under the covers. I sleep with my head underneath the covers as well (sleep borito), and when I woke up I could hear someone in my room (I live alone) and the longer I listened the more I could make out this male voice whispering and really gross sounds. Then I realized this motherfucker was masterbating. Now, when I get SP sometimes my first instinct isn't fear, it's rage. Idk why but that's just how it is sometimes. Then its like I jumped out of my body I started swinging in the dark because I couldn't open my eyes. And I was screaming at this thing in my head to get the fuck outta my space, and I chased it into my closest where it jumped into this weird tunnel in the ceiling and disappeared. Then I was yanked back into my body and fell into a very long lucid dream. Can anyone relate? This is by far the creepiest one I've had in a very long time and I would like some advice.

On the list of possible activities: - hanging out and 420 to relax everyone - drinks are fine though, I personally don‚Äôt drink - some light making out between the three of us - my fwb wants to watch me get head from another guy (including licking my balls and ass) - she would also like to peg a man and maybe spit toast him with me in his mouth and her in his ass - following this, she would also like to get tag teamed and spit roasted herself [not guaranteed] If you think this sounds like a fun afternoon or evening, let us know! I‚Äôll be getting out the guys and she will have final approval. Thanks to everyone who reached out!	DirtyAtx4Atx

The first thing that led me down the rabbit hole that collapsed my shelf while working at the MTC was noticing how the church relied on out-of-context scriptures to teach the Great Apostasy. So here‚Äôs those scriptures and how the church misinterprets them. Hope this is helpful to someone.	This is my second post going through the scriptures the church uses in PMG. They really are grasping at straws when it comes to proving Mormon doctrine with the Bible. I don‚Äôt even really put a lot of stake in the Bible, but most Mormon interpretations fall apart just by being familiar with historical context, or the context of the rest of the chapter or book that a verse is found in. [My previous post about the nature of God and prophets can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/gh6day/my_shelf_experienced_a_catastrophic_collapse_when/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) **The Great Apostasy** Technically the next section should be Jesus Christ‚Äôs ministry, but there really isn‚Äôt much to go into with those scriptures. There‚Äôs descriptions of what Jesus did, and vague mentions of authority that could really mean anything, but the church naturally equates it to the Mormon priesthood. Anyways, the way they misinterpret scriptures to build this narrative about the Great Apostasy is a lot more interesting. I‚Äôm not going to go into the scriptures that talked about false teachers and what not. That was a relevant issue for the early Christian church, and I feel it is a stretch to say that they were prophesying and not just dealing with the matter at hand. So I‚Äôm going to skip those scriptures for the sake of length. **Amos 8:11-12** >11 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord: >12 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it. North and East are not directions listed to give you a sense of ‚Äúall over the place‚Äù. The North is where the nation of Israel was ‚Äútaken‚Äù by Assyria and the East is where the kingdom of Judah was taken by Babylon. These are verses talking about the condition of the Diaspora, not the apostasy. The diaspora, when the Jewish people were separated from their homeland, was also a time where they would be disconnected from their religion. Hence the famine of hearing the words of the Lord. Amos is not talking about the apostasy if Christ‚Äôs church. **Matthew 24:9-11** >9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name‚Äôs sake. >10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. >11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. Jesus seemed to think that the end times were nigh. That to me is one of the greatest ironies of citing any New Testament source to prove the Great Apostasy would be a thing. Jesus isn‚Äôt making a prediction, as much as saying that the current conditions are a sign of the times. Paul does the same thing. False teachers/prophets are always around. So it‚Äôs pretty convenient to say that they are a sign of the end days and that you need to not listen to them. Double irony is the church making reference to false prophets as being a sign of the times and not recognizing that they fit that description quite nicely. **Acts 3:20-21** >20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: >21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. Once again, the time of ‚Äúrestitution of all things‚Äù was thought to be right around the corner by the people who wrote this. And it‚Äôs not referring to the restoration of the gospel. It‚Äôs talking about the resurrection. Restitution of all things is written in better translations as ‚Äúuniversal restoration‚Äù. Which in context of Acts 3, and the theme of the New Testament in general, makes a lot more sense when understood as the resurrection, not the restoration that would happen once the early Christian community selves into apostasy for over 1000 years. **2 Thessalonians 2:3** >Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; This chapter is Paul refuting the idea that the day of the Lord has already come. He still believes it‚Äôs around the corner though. This is what he is referring to when he talks about men deceiving you in the first part of verse 3. The ‚Äúday of the Lord‚Äù is usually referred to the end of the world and traditionally includes the idea of a war between the forces of good and evil. Modern translations translate ‚Äúfalling away‚Äù as ‚Äúrebellion‚Äù. This verse isn‚Äôt talking about an apostasy that has to happen first, it‚Äôs talking about the forces of evil that will rebel against God in the battle at the end of the world. Plus, considering Paul thought the second coming was going to happen in his lifetime, this idea that he thought that a complete apostasy as the church teaches it would happen is ludicrous. **1 Timothy 4:1-3** >1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; >2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; >3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. This prooftext hinges on the interpretation of ‚Äúlatter times‚Äù as being the ‚Äúlatter days‚Äù expressed in the Church‚Äôs full name. Which doesn‚Äôt even make sense, considering the restoration is supposed to happen in latter times, not the apostasy. Additionally, ‚Äúlatter times‚Äù is basically New Testament language for ‚Äúthe last days‚Äù. Which Paul and all of the early Christians believed they were in. He‚Äôs not predicting, just once again explaining the current events and putting religious meaning behind them. **Up Next: The Restoration**	exmormon
First-generation college student preparing to transfer to a university. Looking for good schools that offer need-based aid. Overwhelmed and seeking advice, any little bit helps.	"Sophomore year of high school marked the onset of a nasty mental illness that would go undiagnosed for several years. My grades took a beating, I did zero ACT/SAT prep, and my family knew nothing about the college admissions process. I graduated by the skin of my teeth and spent the next couple of years in a dark place. Anywho, I'm now in my second year of community college and this spring I'll be submitting applications to transfer to a 4-year institution. Luckily, I live next to the University of Florida which has a high transfer rate from my CC, but I don't want to limit myself to one school, especially since UF isn't known for being generous with financial aid. Narrowing down my college selections has been daunting, to say the least. I have very little guidance, and navigating all of the information on the internet with no direction is starting to get overwhelming (seriously, how do people just *know* how to pick a college?) I've been prioritizing schools by how much need-based aid they offer (my EFC will be close to $0) and how transfer-friendly they are. Because I feel pretty secure about getting into UF, I'd like to look at more rigorous universities. Right now I have on my list **Wake Forest, Richmond, UNC, UVA, Bryn Mawr, Notre Dame, Vanderbilt, Smith**, and counting (as well as one or two safeties.) I realize that these schools are competitive, and I'm not going to be devastated if I only get accepted to my hometown university‚Äîits a good school. I'm also trying to go to law school after undergrad, and LSAT & GPA generally matter more than the school you attend. But I'd like to at least try. Alternatively, I'm also open to schools that meet my two main criteria and are perhaps less rigorous but would offer an enjoyable experience (I know that's vague.) Some of my info: * Major: Art History * GPA: 4.0 * ACT: 27 (Reading: 35, English: 32, Math: 17, Science: 23) I will be retaking this. * SAT (old version): 1740 (680 Reading, 660 Writing, 400 Math) I will be retaking this as well. * Extracurriculars: Until now, I've worked 40 hrs/wk (legal assistant; restaurant manager; University administration) to pay my bills, so I haven't had time to get involved on campus, but I will be listing my work experience. Fortunately, I'm moving back in with my parents this coming semester so I can focus on school. I'm in PTK but our chapter isn't very active. * I've recently begun participating in the Smithsonian's Transcription Center digital volunteer program, and I'm hoping to rack up at least 100 hours before I send off my applications (Side note: For anyone needing extra hours, interested in history/research, or just bored during quarantine, this program is *so* cool. You transcribe archived documents/audio files/etc. and the subjects range from astrophysics to women's history to art and more.) * I had an exceptionally challenging upbringing, and I've overcome a *lot.* It makes for excellent essay and personal statement fodder. Gotta do whatcha gotta do, lol. I'm just looking for a bit of direction. If I'm applying to the ""right"" places, If I should explore a different avenue, different school suggestions, ways to strengthen my application, etc. Am I being delusional about having any sort of shot at these schools? **As a first-generation student I'm going into this totally blind and I'm starting to panic. Any advice would be incredibly helpful.** (If anyone has suggestions regarding ACT/SAT prep tools, preferably on the more affordable side, I would love to hear those, as well.) Thank you to anyone who takes the time to offer their thoughts. <3"	ApplyingToCollege

Saftey	I am new to the world of CBD and have been seeing a lot of talk about these D8 products. Lately I have been in search of higher THCA strains for days I need a little extra. When these carts started popping up I saw a lot of skepticism about safety and what was in them. So my question is with the vendors that are selling these, how do you actually know whats in them? I noticed that they do edibles, and tinctures too, same thing with those? I want to try these types of products but I am extremely conscious about what I put in my system from a health standpoint. Has anyone done any tests of their own?	delta8
The Crimson Leviathan	# TL;DR A new boss, the Crimson Leviathan, its home being at a pillar of Netherrack and Crimson greenery (reddery?), a new ranged weapon the Boomerfang, Imagine your peacefully riding your strider through the lava oceans of the Nether towards an unnatural pillar piecing the surface with Crimson vegetation taking its *roots* there. As you get closer you hear a mighty roar as the elusive Crimson Leviathan bursts out of the surface and coils around the column, you're in for one helluva fight! # What is it? The Crimson Leviathan is a massive worm-like animal, with spikes chaotically piecing from its skin and the occasional Crimson plant. It is a whopping 18 blocks long and 2 blocks wide, earning its title of Leviathan. It is said that after a colossal time hibernating, *someone* woke it up, making it very, very angry. # Where do I find it? As stated before, the strange looking pillar is said to be its 'nest' housing the only other traces of its species, yes this thing is a mother, enjoy the guilt you feel after killing it and discovering its probably unfertile eggs, now knowing that it was only defending its children and would probably stop attacking if you just left. There is only one Leviathan in a world at a time, though the pillars are as common as Strongholds, the only thing they are holding, however, is an empty nests and a few skulls. NOTE: The Crimson Leviathan will respawn at a different pillar once defeated after 2 10 in-game days. # Attacks How will this thing kill you, you ask? In many, many very painful ways. It has a few attacks it can do, it will sink under the lava, swim around for a bit, then violently emerge at the location you were about 3 seconds ago, it can also take a delicious gulp of magma then spit it at you, setting you on fire if it hits you, etc. # The Loot So, you've killed it, either legitimately or using some exploit, it's done. What is your reward? Juicy loot. The Crimson Leviathan drops 1 Boomerfang and 12 Netherite Scrap. Your probably wondering 'What the hell is a Boomerfang?' A new ranged weapon. Upon throwing it, it will leave your inventory and travel in a straight line of a max of 40 blocks, at about a sheep's running speed, then return to you at an equal speed. It will deal 6 hearts of damage, and pierce enemies but only on the return trip. Its one great flaw, however, is it cannot be enchanted, but is unbreakable, due to once being the Leviathan's tooth. I hope you liked my idea!	minecraftsuggestions

One hour market update	So nothing really unexpected going on currently. I bought KTOV at $0.37 Friday sold at $0.50 today (26% move) and moved into BIOC at $0.42. Will exit if it hits $0.37 or lower. I think KTOV is still going higher but I‚Äôm happy with that trade. However watch that $0.50 level for KTOV and trade accordingly. 1st target for BIOC is $0.5096 2nd target $0.6927	pennystocks

Is this a greenflag?	I mean, I was NOT even having a crush on this girl, to me she is nothing more than a friend, a girl who is a friend to me. Nothing big. But there was time that she says things like ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt have anyone to actually love later in life, maybe having you as a friend is enough.‚Äù There was once when we was hanging out together, we took the bus home, and she asked me to ‚Äútake her around the town on my Honda‚Äù (I live in Vietnam so Honda is quite common). She leaned on my shoulder and all that closeness is great, but that feeling is gone after, and I am convinced that it is just me being high due to intimacy. She asked me tomorrow to take her to school because she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have money to take a Grab bike‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know, this makes me sound like I am just a guy freaking out on girl, but no I am just confused whether she is giving me green flag or not. We are pretty close as friends, but not as lovers, yet I genuinely don‚Äôt have any feelings that can be classified as ‚Äúlove‚Äù towards her. If she is sad, I am the one who she thinks of first to vent. She is in a relationship with a girl (she said that she is bisexual, and she has only been dating girls only), but does she have anything more than just a friend for me?	love

36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar. If you're on the same page, hit me up."	chat

Almost Ten Years of Assets and Debt my Personal Finances over a decade	I have been tracking my finances with Mint for almost 10 years now. I thought some of you might find this chart interesting. It is my cash, investments, and non-mortgage debt over the last 9.5 years. I annotated it to highlight major financial events in my life. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/z1qhbwsvcx4gf9q/10%20years%20of%20Debt%20and%20Assets.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z1qhbwsvcx4gf9q/10%20years%20of%20Debt%20and%20Assets.png?dl=0) Since I started tracking I graduated from university, did some grad school, worked at 3 different jobs, got married, bought a home, had 2 kids. In the last 5 months, the stock market crash had a larger effect on my assets than buying a car did 5 years ago. I leave out mortgage debt, home value and car value. those are hard to track precisely over time or drastically skew the latter half of the chart.	PersonalFinanceCanada

Glorious Freedom	"NOT LOOKING FOR ADVICE OR ANYTHING! JUST SHARING MY STORY! This post is late, but it is still due. On Saturday, my wife and I drove 2.5 hours away to pick up my brand new 2020 Iron 1200 in Barracuda Silver (a must). My brother lived in the city I picked the bike up in and he met me there on his bike (2019 Yamaha Bolt C-Spec). Prior to picking this bike up, I had minimal experience. I completed the Harley MSF course in January and haven't been in the saddle since. That all changed when I picked up this beaut. After a couple of laps around the Harley Dealership, it was time. With an abundance of caution, my brother and I, with my wife and pup following in a car behind us, we were out of the parking lot driving off into the city of wonder. Before I knew it, I was up to 55MPH (speed limit) and the wind was relieving my years of stress. By Saturday evening, the bike was broken in (according to the service manager at Harley, ride 45 minutes shifting through all the gears and all RPM ranges, let cool 20 min, ride 45 min. again, and cool again, this will break a motorcycle in when you live in the mountains). Over the course of the weekend, my brother, who was beyond supportive and provided just enough constructive criticism, had pushed me just out of my comfort zone. We rode down empty streets, busy roadways, highway stretches, mountain curves, and everything in between. I wasn't so far out of my comfort zone as to where an accident was imminent. I was pushed out just enough to where I didn't have a choice but to experience what the world had to offer. He rode at his speed in the twisties, I rode at mine. As any great leader of a group ride would, he waited for me when the time was right. I was never pushed to run faster or to place myself in dangerous situations. Come yesterday around 4 PM, our weekend of riding was concluded, together anyway. When we split ways, he had a 1-hour commute home and I was looking at a daunting 2.5-hour commute home. We exchanged blessings of safe commutes and the normal ""love ya's"" that we do, and off we were to our homes. After the weekend riding with him, I was a lot less intimidated by the long commute home (my wife was also behind me the whole way with the pup watching from the back seat). I quickly realized that due to all the experience I was given over the weekend, this commute was nowhere near as daunting. In fact, it was peaceful and exhilarating at the same time. No jitters, no fear, just fun. By 8 PM last night, the bike was parked and my wife and I were enjoying some rest and relaxation after a long weekend. What a time to be alive. For this weekend, and the days, years, decades to follow, the ride made me forget the current state of affairs, my daily stressors, and anything and everything that didn't pertain to the ride. Alas, I am now part of the family, not just the motorcycle community, but the Harley Davidson community. TL;DR: Bought 2020 Iron 1200 in Barracuda Silver. Brother and I rode all weekend, broke her in, put over 250 miles on her, and made a 2.5-hour commute back to the home city as a 3rd-day rider."	Harley
Possible PCOS diagnosis	Hello everyone! I‚Äôve lurked here on and off over the last year due to suspicions that my combination of symptoms pointed to PCOS. I had a wellness exam today (my first in about five years) and my new PCP confirmed that it‚Äôs very likely the culprit. I‚Äôm going in tomorrow morning for labs to check my blood sugar levels and for any hormone irregularities. I‚Äôm feeling a little overwhelmed but also like a big weight has been lifted? I‚Äôve struggled with my weight, irregular/unpredictable periods, and a lot of unwanted facial hair for YEARS, and honestly just thought it was my unlucky lot in life, but to possibly have an answer for all of it finally? It‚Äôs a welcome relief. So I just wanted to say hi and that I‚Äôm so glad there‚Äôs a supportive subreddit out there for people struggling with this particular issue. üíõ	PCOS

It‚Äôs getting hard	It‚Äôs getting really hard to believe that God loves me. I was 100% healthy my whole life. Then in 2016 everything changed and it just keeps getting worse and worse. I‚Äôve had health anxiety my whole life but I had it under control for the most part. In 2016 my mom has a stroke. She recovered fine and didn‚Äôt have any lingering effects, thank God. At the same time I had an abnormal pap which turned out to be ok and I‚Äôve had normal ones ever since. Then in 2017 I had a lump in my breast which also turned out to be nothing serious... then 2018 hit and I took my mom to the ER because we thought she was having another stroke. She tuned out to be ok again. I had some weird inverted ear drum thing which made it hard to hear but it eventually went away. At the same time my sister moved far away and a lady at work died.. then I started getting pressure in my head and I felt dizzy from it all the time... in July 2019 I ended up going to the doctor for the head pressure thing and she said it was tension headaches... so I have been dealing with that ever since. Back in October 2019 I had gotten 2 dry red patches of skin on my legs... turns out I now have nummular eczema. It did go away after using steroid cream but I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs a chronic illness and I‚Äôll have to deal with flare ups for the rest of my life... I just don‚Äôt understand what I did so wrong to deserve all of this happening to me. It feels like God hates me and isn‚Äôt even there for me. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve become so depressed.	Christian

If I clear advanced next year, I think I‚Äôll stay here but if I don‚Äôt, should I try to go to Germany?

Threatening Jury Votes Strategy	"This is a strategy I've wondered about while rewatching RI and other seasons and I don't know of it's even allowed. After the merge in RI, Ometepe is up 7-5 and vote out one of their own. Now 6-5, Zapatera works like crazy to try and get one of them to open up their eyes and see that they are brainwashed robots. Alas, they don't and the get Pagonged. My idea for a strategy is this: After the first Zapatera member gets picked off and the numbers are 6-4, they see the writing on the wall and are pretty much sitting ducks. They know Rob is completely in control and brainwashed his fellow 5 Ometepe members. What if they go up to Rob and say, ""We know you're in control, if you don't take put a few Ometepe people before you tale all of us out, the 4 of us will vote against you at FTC."" Let's just say it's not a bluff and they will follow through with it. That would force Rob to do something, because if someone is definitely getting 4 votes at FTC, then all they need is 1 more and hes screwed. I've only seem s1-22 and s38-40. Has this strategy ever been used or thought of? Is it allowed? What are your thoughts?"	survivor
For anyone who did not know about this amazing reference in S31E20...	"So I recently saw this episode and was amazed to see my favorite musical adopted by The Simpsons, where Lisa sings a song similar to ""Maybe some time"", originally sung by Lisa Minelli (heh) in 1972 movie ""Cabaret"", which is set in 1931 Germany.

Opinion - All of the Insidious movies are good	Not saying this is unpopular, just my opinion after watching The Last Key today. Some of the movies are better than others, and there are definitely things I think each one could have done better, but none of them fall completely flat or aren't worth seeing if you enjoy any of them. Have to say I was pretty impressed that we got 3 sequels that were just as worthwile. If you like any of them, or are a fan of this brand of 2010s horror, there's four movies worth adding to your list.	horror

"Weird dream about ""Candle Girl."""	"I just woke up, so please forgive my atrocious grammar. I want to write all of this down before I forget. Btw, I am not Catholic. I grew up Southern Baptist. Last night I dreamed of browsing through a book intensively detailed about saints with pictures, and I somewhat paused at the name of a female saint from France (not Joan of Arc). Suddenly, a woman showed up in the bedroom, and by then, the surrounding was unfamiliar to me. The room consisted of rusty, old-fashioned furniture. It was dim. She informed me that she only appears to people whose times are not ready for them (she mentioned Salem, Mass, and many other places). She explained that she goes by ""Candle Girl,"" even though she has a real name, and the only birth she appeared was at Jesus Christ's. She changed her appearance several times while talking to me. Firstly, she looked like a white woman with a sly demeanor. Secondly, her face shifted to a Medusa-like figure, only with the skin of a tree. Lastly, her head was of a cow skull. She mentioned that the last time somebody saw her was that saint I found in the book, and the world changed. She disappeared, and then I found myself in another dream. I somehow ended up praying to her for wisdom when I didn't know where she was, and the environment was unsettling. I woke up right after praying to her. That is quite baffling. I am not knowledgable about saints, and even while growing up, Christianity always seemed off to me. There is a possibility that my hormones are playing with me because it seems as if my period is late, and even though the pregnancy tests are negative, people say that it is too early to test. What do you guys think? Does 'Candle Girl' sound familiar?"	pagan

BTRFS Cache reliability concerns	"I posted a similar question on the Unraid forums, interested in hearing what reddit thinks: [https://forums.unraid.net/topic/92264-btrfs-cache-reliability-concerns/](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/92264-btrfs-cache-reliability-concerns/) &#x200B; Hi, I'm wondering if BTRFS is the right solution for a resilient cache / storage solution? I run two Unraid servers, primary 40TB disk plus 2TB cache (4 x 1TB SSD), secondary 26TB disk plus 2TB cache (4 x 1TB SSD). On two occasions I've lost my entire Cache volume due one of the drives ""failing"". I say failing, but really both times it was my own fault, I didn't want to shut down, and I pulled the wrong drive, and immediately plugged it back in. But this is no different to a drive failing, or a connection failing. Pulling disks during certification of large resilient storage systems is a perfectly good test. One would expect the loss of 1 disk in a 4 disk BTRFS RAID10 config to be a non-issue, not so, first the log started showing BTRFS corruption issue, ok, seems it is not being auto fixed, then I run a cache scrub, no errors, still errors in the log, scrub with repair, reported repaired. Then I started getting docker write failures, seems my cache became read-only, and BTRFS corrupt. In both cases I resorted to rebuilding the cache from scratch, and restored appdata backups, lost the VM's (unlike docker stop/restart no easy way to backup VM's). I've run hardware RAID for a long time, including hardware that uses SSD caching, I've lost disks, pulled disks, but in all cases the array eventually comes back on its own. I simply do not have the same trust in Unraid's cache, I think it is fragile, I think it is unreliable to the point where it needs to be backed up constantly. I'd like to see the Unraid/Limetech publish their resiliency test and performance plans? What is tested for, what are known failure scenarios, what are known recoverable scenarios, are my expectations of resiliency and performance unfounded? And this is not about BTRFS, this is about Unraid, I don't care what Unraid uses for the cache volume, it could have supported SSD's in data volumes and no cache would be required, it could have used ZFS and we would have different problems, BTRFS was an Unraid choice, and I find it fragile. What are your experiences with cache resiliency?"	unRAID

Actual Definition of TCGLow?	I've been selling on a few different places recently and I list my cards as TCGLow - 10%, which is the standard I see. I go through and update my prices once every couple of days and tell people I'll drop to 10% TCGLow if the prices have fluctuated. Now, I've had a few people argue with me/cancel orders because they think my prices are too high. They want the TCGPlayer App calculation of 'TCGLow' instead of the lowest listing price -10%. My assumption/undestanding is TCGLow -10% is the current lowest listing price (considering condition) -10% and not the lowest the card has ever been -10%, which some people seem to want. Unfortunately, there isn't a live 'TCGLow' number because 'Market Price' is always lagging behind, but I'm not going to take another 20-30% off of something because it was lower last month.	mtgfinance

My friends held me being ‚Äògifted‚Äô against me	When I got into enrichment ( gifted program if it‚Äôs different for others) my friend told me my other friend ( f2 from now on) hadn‚Äôt even gotten in to test and was sad. And that I didn‚Äôt deserve to be happy about it. They used this as a guilt trip for years, any time we got into a fight or a friend got into a fight and we were on opposite sides, they used it against me. I told them over and over again that it‚Äôs not my fault I got in and f2 didn‚Äôt. I said I thought f2 would, that f2 was smarter than me ( completely true). They finally stopped and have grown up. It was tiring and I‚Äôm glad they no longer try to use it against me, but I still feel awkward talking about enrichment in front of f2. That‚Äôs my story for today, anyone else have friends ( or just people) who did the same thing to them?	Gifted
Overcoming injury as athlete - No will to live	Hello, I am 24 year old martial artist and I competed in alot of martial arts with a goal of going as far as I can in mixed martial arts, like 2 years ago I started having back issues and it got really serious to point where I can't do any training besides specific stretches and I have alot of problems sleeping, until Corona started I worked as Kickboxing coach and that helped me a bit to get that ''fix'' of fulfilment. Even before injury I had some form of depression my whole life which I guess I took from my dad who is depressed since I know him, but I was learning alot about it and found my way to deal with it with having strucutured days and always being focused on some sort of goal, when It got bad I would do my best to funnel that anger i sadness into focus for my career I would go to gym and start drilling tehniques, now that I can't do that anymore its getting worse and worse and I am starting to be afraid because its not just being sad and angry anymore but I'm getting new ''symptoms'' like new bad thoughts and my reactions to everything are getting worse, I feel like all my qualities that I had are dying and I really dislike my self, I provide no money to my family, I feel like heavy burden since we are not rich to ''afford'' me being like this, we are not poor but not wealthy enough for me to not be able to help. Before I very very rarely cried, and currently its often occurrence that I start crying and I have hard time stopping and most of time that I am awake I spend having like pressure feeling in my chest, like when you are really angry/sad and for first time in my life I got like some sort of panic attack 2 times in 4 days where my body suddenly felt really weak and I was all dizzy/headache. I tried everything to deal with this until I fix my back which is also on ''pause'' because of corona, In last year I tried drinking, doing drugs, eating very healthy, eating very unhealthy, playing video games all day, reading books, learning something new like psychology which always interested me, but nothing is working, some of it helped for like week or few weeks but I am out of ideas. Its been a while that I don't mind dieing, I'm tired of dealing with back pain whole day and seeing that everyone is improving and getting better as fighters while I am stuck and getting worse and worse physicaly, which is probably my biggest problem I feel like my dream for which I sacrificed alot for already of becoming elite fighter is getting crushed and I feel hopeless, every day is just dealing with both physical and mental pain and Its starting to have effects on my health in other ways, my best friend also passed away recently so I don't have someone to really talk about it like this, even with him it was/would be hard for me to talk about like this. All i see is negative and not having ''goals'' is really taking a toll on me, I am starting to be afraid of suicide, I don't want to do it but it often comes to my mind but I just shake it off fast, but that thought is becoming more clearer like ''cons'' of it are becoming less valuable and ''pros'' more valuable if that makes sense and that scares me, I don't want to give up but I don't know how to fight it. I never talk about this like this so its hard for me to explain everything especially since my english is not great and I don't except someone to really read all of this but I decided to force my self to write about it somewhere, I have nothing to lose and maybe someone went through something similliar or have experience with stuff like this here. My lets say ''question'' is do you have some suggestion/tip what to do ? How to deal with this, my whole life since i was 4 is training and doing my best to become best and that helped me a ton with my depression, without it I am really lost and I'm losing it, I want to get better for me and for those who care about me. Thanks a ton to anyone reading this <3	overcoming
36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar.

Here's some other hints as to what people wanted: ‚Ä¢ During the alpha/beta, people criticized how the British looked and praised the Germans. ‚Ä¢ People started pointing out how the only fully (excluding gear) British torso in the game was the Patriot, while everything else was American. ‚Ä¢ People noticed that the Germans have better outfits overall. ‚Ä¢ A subreddit dedicated to making custom/accurate uniform combinations was created (r/BattlefieldCosmetics) ‚Ä¢ People start pointing out inaccuracies (ex: the size of the Stahlhelm). ‚Ä¢ People start making accurate uniforms in photoshop, which end up looking better than what we got. ‚Ä¢ The gas mask fiasco. ‚Ä¢ When the denison smock and other accurate british uniforms were teased in Chapter 4, people were foaming at the mouth for them. They never came. ‚Ä¢ The wanderer styled sets are very accurate skins, and as such, many people bought them. ‚Ä¢ The themed bundles (Burnt, Halloween) were hated by people because of how out of place the skins looked, as well as the fact that they could be used by all factions. ‚Ä¢ Everybody praised the accurate uniforms that were added into the Pacific. ‚Ä¢ Throughout the game's entire life cycle, people point out how pieces of equipment from way after WWII are slapped onto outfits. ‚Ä¢ Battlefield 1. The entirety of Battlefield 1 proves that people like authenticity a lot. And to throw that authenticity out of the window was a really bad idea on DICE's part. So yeah... I just find it hard to believe that they didn't have at least a bit of an idea as to what people wanted. DICE at the very least should've just made the same amount of accurate skins as inaccurate skins and added an option to disable inaccurate skins. Presto, now you've appealed to history buffs and people who don't care, and you'd still be making a profit. Win win for all. EDIT: I'll add more if people can think of more hint"	BattlefieldV

-2 stocks for SD	Why is this even a thing? If someone wants to kill themselves, they are going to do it anyway.. what use is it to make it quicker? Sure its a rare thing to happen, but the most rage-inducing event is when your winning a game, the opponent(s) are down to their last stock, you loose your first stock, and then SD afterwards by accident before getting hit. You go from 3 stocks to out in a matter of seconds. Sure its your fault, but if it were just 1 stock, then you would still be in the game. Why do you have to loose 2? The times this has happened to me is generally on moving stages or stages with moving floors, with characters with bad recoveries.. Someone tell me why the 2 stock punishment for SDing makes any sense?	SmashRage
How do you guys stop urban exploration on your newer properties?	This issue has been in the media recently, where a jogger was doing some urban exploration on a property and was mistakenly shot. But it brings up an issue I‚Äôve had for years on my newer properties, with suburban white women and homosexuals thinking it‚Äôs okay to trespass if they just want a look. It‚Äôs a slippery slope because when they come on the property then joggers and everyone else think it‚Äôs okay to trespass, as well. Has anyone dealt with this issue? How did you resolve it ü§î	LoveForLandlords

My dom is never emotional and never shows his feelings but I made him feel giddy and super flattered over this odd compliment	"So my fianc√© and I are complete opposites. I am very emotional and he is very rational. Despite we have conflicting interests, which I find sometimes annoying, I believe our differences makes us attracted to each other. Hear me out--he is the type of man who never becomes emotional over the small stuff. He is not open with his feelings. Like what I said, he is rational...almost too good to be true. STORY: My fianc√© and I were separated because of quarantine. Awhile ago, during our nightly phone calls, he mentioned to me that he recently almost drank every night since he found it enjoyable to do so while watching Netflix. Even if I was concerned about his health and weight, I told him to enjoy himself. Due to the heavy traffic he endured several months ago due to his previous work and the sudden unemployment he experienced afterwards before quarantine, I liked him to have fun for now especially that he is now working from home. Also, he is now working in a respectable company. However, he said, ""what if after this we see each again and you see me have a big belly?"" And my reply, ""I still love you no matter what."" And you know what? He acted so giddy like a little girl and his voice went high pitched saying, ""really? you'll still love me?"" Of course, I said yes! Gosh, out of all the cheesy confessions I told him and he did not show emotions about it, this simple comment, ""I'll still love you no matter what"" works wonders?? Can you guys explain why?"

My (29M) SIL (23F) has been listening in while i fuck my wife (27F)	My wifes sister was staying with us for a few weeks when her mum threw her out. That turned into few months and now shes been here almost a year. My wife and I have a healthy relationship but always tried to keep it down when we had sex because she thought it was a bit wierd if SIL heard us (apprently not weird enough to not have sex though). But alot of the time we get caught in the moment and end up loudee than we expected to be. I noticed my SIL had started to get a lot more comfortable around the house. Wearing sports bras around the house and one time i even walked into the kitchen in the early hours and she was making a coffee in her underwear. She didn't even bat an eye. Just continued her conversation with me. The other night she had an online Zoom quiz with her friends and asked if she could use our laptop. The day after, i used the laptop for work but she had left her WhatsApp Web logged in and i saw a conversation with her friend on her Foorball Team about how she'd been listening to us having sex for weeks and thought it was hot. Am i reading to much into this or is she trying to make a move? I would never cheat on my wife but god damn her sister is attractive.	SluttyConfessions

Why the trident is the best item in minecraft (I totally didn't spend ages making a crappy copypasta)	***Why the trident is the best item in minecraft*** A trident is basicly the best item in the game, unlike all the other items except shields and boats (which are boring) the trident has a wonderfull 3d texture. Some people could argue that a arrow has the same kind of thing, but NO, the arrow has no volume, it's just 2 flat faces. The trident, as well as having a lovely 3d texture also has it's own unique animation when you're holding it. The trident is a far more sophisticated weapon than a sword, for swords you just bruteishly bash people with them but with a trident you can throw them AND stab people with them. Tridents can also be used with the riptide enchantment and an elytra to FLY REALLY FAST during a thunderstorm. Unlike netherrite swords the trident can be edited on PMCskin3d and posted on PlanetMinecraft. And then we have the sound it makes. The trident makes a WONDERFULL ding sound when thrown, unlike the boring nethrite sword which is clearly not as good as the lovely TRIDENT. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.	Minecraft
I just experienced the worst thing while hosting a catalogue party	My friend and I were hosting our first ever catalogue party through turnip exchange at my island. Things were going swimmingly, and everyone was so polite. It started going downhill when someone didn‚Äôt follow the rules I set out, and began taking everyone‚Äôs furniture without putting them down. I repeatedly typed out, ‚Äòdrop the items‚Äô but that person would not listen and began taking the free furniture and DIY‚Äôs I laid out too. My friend and I tried to block the bridge so she couldn‚Äôt leave, but this BLOODY TROLL WHIPPED HER BLOODY POLE OUT and was about to jump over the river to leave (I know, I should‚Äôve fenced the river). I quickly apologised to everyone and ended the session right there. I‚Äôm beyond angry and disappointed with what just happened. Thinking back on it now, I should‚Äôve just forced shutdown my switch or closed the game entirely. That would have probably made the game not save, and the other people could still have their furniture with them. This whole situation has just put me off and I probably won‚Äôt be hosting something like this again. This is my warning to you all. Please be careful when hosting something similar to this. If you‚Äôre using turnip exchange, maybe end the session when an unknown person that is not in queue, rocks up to your island. Another thing maybe, is to have people mention their in-game name so you know who‚Äôs travelling to your island. Please don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. I feel incredibly guilty to the three other people that got their furniture stolen. Suffice to say, I‚Äôve learnt my lesson.	ac_newhorizons
Would uploading this fic be offensive?	This might be a weird question, but I want to hear people's opinions on it. Since 2017, I have been working on a particular Pokemon fanfic that is currently unpublished because it required such a large amount of work. I'm talking over 160 Fakemon (complete with Pokedex entries, Abilities and movesets), a brand new region and an entire cast of OCs kind of big. Just last month, I got to a point where I was ready to start writing...and then I realised that one of the Legendary Pokemon represented disease...and we're in a pandemic... So...is now not a good time? Would you guys be offended if something like this popped up during a pandemic? When I came up with this fic and put so much work into it, I had no idea that the world would face something like this by the time I was about to post it, but I've put so much work into this, and I'll be so frustrated if about 3 years of hard work goes down the drain. I keep thinking about how much backlash a TV channel in my country got when they played Contagion just as the virus started to spread. How long would it be safe to leave this after the pandemic ends? Maybe I should just write the fanfiction and post it when I'm finished. That'll be, like, 6 years down the line, based on past experiences with my writing speed (I'm joking, of course).	FanFiction

Elon's Divine Restraint	So far Elon has shown extraordinary restraint by merely suing Alameda County, who audaciously blockaded his Tesla Freemont factory in a vain attempt to stop it from reopening. Similarly Elon's passing comment that he's relocating Freemont production and their HQ to Texas/Nevada can be viewed as a reasoned and reasonable response to these crackpot dictums of pettyfogging bureaucrats. So why, we ask ourselves is Elon withholding his hand, and not gone wrath of God on these MFBs? In less than an hour he could go full on and ICBM their ass, fools deserve it. No doubt Alameda will soon come to their senses, when they pull their head out - and get back on track to a far more ecological future!	SpaceXMasterrace
36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar. If you're on the same page, hit me up."	chat

respect people's pronouns	&#x200B; Its simple respect, just respect how others want to be treated as such. You don't have to agree with them even, but you should just always respect everyone.

Just treat people nicely. edit: damn holy fuck a lot of you are assholes &#x200B;	teenagers

[NEWBIE] I am starting to suck less!	"I'm hoping this can serve as some motivation for my beginning peers. &#x200B; THE SHORT VERSION: After 2 weeks of wanting to quit due to struggling without achieving any tangible progress, I am FINALLY seeing real results. &#x200B; THE LONG VERSION: Out of sheer boredom, I was idly browsing online guitar sites (probably thanks to some kind of a Facebook ad) and I considered how ridiculous I'd look trying to buy a nice guitar in person. ""Hmmm...the E minor chord sounds very nice on this one. I'll take it!"" I am essentially a beginner after having been away from the guitar for (oh God) 20+ years. About to hit 40, stuck in quarantine, the bug bit me. Noodling around on my own these last 2 months helped me quickly remember the reason why I gave up in my teen years. I don't have a natural talent. And EVERYONE ELSE IS better than me. I am always going to be picked last in guitar gym class. Throughout the years, whenever I'd be at a party, or over at someone's house, I'd get drinking and want to show off with the one or two songs I actually knew how to play. And all the people that called themselves terrible at guitar would take a turn and blow me out of the water. They'd get through the recognizable parts on songs and do some finger tricks that looked complicated af to me. Even so-called 'terrible guitar players' wiped the floor with me. That kind of crap always killed my motivation and made me stop wanting to go any further. It wasn't fair. How come they all learned how to do cool stuff while barely practicing!! (So I thought.) Another issue I had was trying to be self-taught (like all the best rock musicians are). I'd invariably find myself reinforcing what I already knew how to do, and I would quickly get frustrated when not seeing progress on trying to learn new stuff. Anyway. Knowing there would never be a better time to just sit and practice by myself, I came to this subreddit and soon found my way over to justin guitar. At first I had to force myself to follow the lesson plan. It's not that I wasn't having fun, but I hated feeling like I would never get much better than being okayish at the lesson material no matter how hard I tried -- like there was a raw talent limit that would hold me back forever. But I kept making myself practice every day. Just for 20 minutes. Buzzing strings. Painful fingers (after being away from it for so long). Lots of sighing. Lots of beating myself up over how terrible and limited I was. But I kept coming back every day. Trying to remember how different driving is today versus when I first started. Or riding a bicycle. Or typing on a keyboard. Or even learning to read. Seriously, my big motivator was thinking about all the things in my life that run on autopilot for me today that took tons of effort and continuous practice to get any good at. And it was still tough. Because day after day I felt like I wasn't getting better. Some days I'd think I was even getting worse. I don't know how to fully articulate this, but something happened this weekend. I sucked less. The buzzing was less frequent. My fingers were remembering how to make shapes faster. I still sucked. But...noticeably less. Then, today, I made it through all of my basic chord changes without ANY buzzing. And I was able to do it sort of quickly. After 2 weeks of telling myself I was absolutely hopeless, and certain that I'd just quit, I SUCKED LESS. And it feels incredible. Hopefully this can serve as exactly the kind of story that can help another beginner push past that initial hump into believing this whole journey is possible. I'm excited to be working my way up to the day where I can go into the guitar store and say ""I'm still a beginner. But my practice regime feels and sounds real good on this thing. I'll take it."""

How do I tell my best friend that I wasn't as drunk as he thought he got me and I remember what he did to me?	So me and my best friend downed an entire bottle of Vodka and got superrr drunk. But, he drank more than me. I still was not thinking clearly and I wasn't all there, but I still can kinda remember what was going on. I was kinda in and out. We were sleeping over together and were both on an air mattress. I remember dozing off, and then waking up to him giving me a blow job. It took me a while to process it, but I was so confused that I just kinda let it happen. Then he grabbed my hand and put it on his dick and started moving my hand up and down until I was giving him a hand job. I was still so drunk that I was really confused as to what was happening, and I just kinda did it but I didn't mean it at ALL. Then he bent over and grabbed my dick and tried to get me to put it in his ass and that's when I stopped because I was finally realizing what was happening. I shoved him off of me and I went to sleep. I woke up in the morning and got out of there before he could wake up. I still haven't talked to him. I don't know whether to fake that I don't remember to keep our friendship or to confront him and not be friends. I'm straight and I'm 16. I've had sex before but not with guys (obviously) and luckily this wasn't sex but it was still really weird. What should I do?	Advice
Other Personas based on roguish modern fictional characters or historical figures?	We've had Arsene and >!Raoul!<, Captain Kidd and >!William!<, Carmen and >!Celestine!<, Goemon and >!Gorokichi!<, Johanna and >!Agnes!<, Necronomicon and >!Al Azif!<, Milady and >!Lucy!<, Robin Hood and >!Hereward!<, Cendrillon and >!Ella and finally Valjean.!< I love all these neat references to modern fictional characters and historical figures. It makes me wonder what other references could be there that would be a suitable Persona within P5. I know that the Scruffy ACAU has used Black Bart, Anne Bonny, Mata Hari, Metrodora, Jeanne d'Arc, Pythia and Odysseus (Nice P2 callback). But aside from that what else would be a neat Persona to see with the rogue like references to fiction and history? Just a fun discussion have leave any ideas in the comments below with the name, the reference and how it would look like for a Phantom Thief. I'll go first: [Fantomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fant%C3%B4mas) > *A fictional character created by French writers* *Marcel Allain* *(1885‚Äì1969) and* *Pierre Souvestre* *(1874‚Äì1914). One of the most popular characters in the history of French* *crime fiction* *where he represented a transition from* *Gothic novel* *villains of the 19th century to modern-day* *serial killers**.* > >*Is known to be a criminal genius, ruthless and particularly elusive as the cause of almost any unsolved crime, a merciless criminal who can get away with his evil deeds by impersonating pretty much anyone as a master of disguise. He was created and introduced few years after Arsene Lupin, another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fant√¥mas has no such qualms and is shown as a sociopath who enjoys killing in a sadistic fashion that shows no mercy to anyone.* I find it interesting that whilst we have Arsene for Joker we don't have a Persona that could serve as like a rival or shadow archetype to the Gentleman Thief. He could have worked as a Persona for Akechi fitting his Black Mask self. For it's appearance I imagine it to look sort of like the Black Ghosts from Ajin Demi-Human.	Persona5

Help rebuilding my Templar	I've been playing this game on and off for the last 2 years without a whole lot of knowledge of making my own builds, and thanks to Quarantine I've been playing this game a lot recently and I wanted to revisit my first toon; a Templar with a wanna be Paladin feel but I didn't want to make another Healer or Tank so I wanted to make him a dedicated Off-tank with tanking and healing capabilities. I've been following some of Alcasts' builds and read his advanced Tanking Guide so I wanted to give it a shot. The focus is more so about Trials than Dungeons (Though I'm sure with the way it's set up now it can easily handle a few vet dungeons). Here's the link to my build, and if there're any questions let me know, I'm just wondering if this setup is viable enough to run as an off-tank in some vet trials with the exception of some flex sets/moves like Lord Warden, DefStance, Vigor (if I swapped Powerful Assault), for Ritual of Retribution and etc. Tank you for any feedback! &#x200B; [https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Special:EsoBuildEditor?id=234990](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Special:EsoBuildEditor?id=234990)	elderscrollsonline
My neighbor is having loud sex with tinder dates. How can I report her to the authorities?	Last night I was lying in bed at around 8pm masturbating to videos of Dr Fauci talking about continued lockdowns when I heard my neighbor having loud sex. It completely threw me out of my session, so I was pretty angry, but then I got even more angry when I realized that she lives alone - so she must have invited a guest over!! I know she's a big user of tinder, so it was probably someone from tinder or grindr or some kind of app!! Fucking thot. I can't believe she's having intimate bodily contact with other people during this crisis. It's bad enough that she's rubbing the fact that she has regular sex in my face, so to do this is just beyond the pale. Doesn't she realize that this virus is deadly, and that by bringing her disgusting man sluts up into our apartment complex that she's exposing me and everyone in the building to this deadly disease? I leave my apartment once or twice a week (usually to throw my piss jugs down the chute) and I cringe to know that I could have breathed the same air as this person! I hear COVID can last on any surface for weeks, what if he also touched the garbage chute door?? I'm literally shaking with rage as I type this. Something needs to be done. What can I do? There must be some COVID authorities that can take care of this for me, surely? Maybe someone can come and rough her up a bit, or maybe threaten her with violence? Weld her door shut? Can someone help?	CoronavirusCirclejerk
Great apps for Mirroring for Android	&#x200B; I just thought of sharing since I found it useful. I am the type of user that explores a lot of things. I download apps more often to see how can I mirror my phone to a much wider screen Well lately I found out some apps that you can consider using to do so. By the way, I watch movies and play games available on mobile devices on my TV and PC. Here is the list. 1. ApowerMirror ApowerMirror is a desktop app that works across all platform devices. This includes PC, TV and of course mobile devices. What's more with the app? It can record the screen activity while you are mirroring, annotate, and even capture your screen. Also, it has the capability to control your mobile device on your PC. The only thing that won't be transferred on your PC is the sound. 2. Screen Mirror The next tool is a free web-based app. You can access this anywhere. You just have to have a browser compatible with it and scan the Qr code. That being said, you need your phone and your PC connected under the same Wi-fi network. 3. Wireless Projection (Built-in) Many Android users probably see the benefit of having a Huawei Device. The wireless projection feature along with the Huawei Share feature allows you to connect your TV and your phone without connecting to a Wi-Fi server. How do I know? I use it my self. Am I bluffing? Of course not! It is one of the great features Huawei has. However, Huawei share is only available on the latest software version.	androidapps

Reasons why I keep going	I started working out again and go hiking a lot. Right now I don¬¥t have the excuse anymore that drinking will destroy any progress anyway. I also improved my nutrition and lost quite some weight. Noticing it in the mirror and also hearing compliments from co-workers feels damn good :) . Another huge benefit is that organ pain stopped almost completely, and my heart doesn¬¥t feel like it¬¥s gonna fail any second anymore. Brain fog is almost gone. My memory was really bad when drinking almost daily, this has improved a lot. I even started to remember things I thought I had long forgotten, things before I became an alcoholic. Sleep has improved drastically. I still have trouble falling asleep, but I don¬¥t wake up 5 times every night covered in sweat. Instead, I can sleep through 5-7 hours. I have a doctors appointment in a couple of days to check out my blood levels (first one in years). I am scared of the results, but as I have read somewhere on this subreddit before: **Quitting alcohol doesn¬¥t solve your problems, it allows you to take care of your problems.**	stopdrinking

Why I'm riding in the road	"Dear asshole who yelled at me, here are many reasons I might be riding in the road. * there is broken glass or other debris in the bike lane, the bike lanes commonly have junk in them you would not want to ride over (or which might be dangerous) * someone has parked in the bike lane or stationed something in the bike lane, trust me when I say that the bike lane is always the first part of the road to be blocked by something or someone (trash cans, rideshare, orange cones, improperly parked vehicles, ...) * there are cars parked reaaaaaal close to the bike lane and I'm worried someone might open their door and send me head over heels. Usually I just keep my eyes peeled but if a car has tinted windows, or it's a truck, or my spidey sense tingles, I may move out of the bike lane * there's a big curb or ditch or hedge or something on the side of the road, I can't ride right next to something where if I swerve 6"" to the right I'll fall in a hole or hit a curb. Not usually a problem with actual bike lanes, but if there's no bike lane, this can be a real issue Trust me when I say, I want nothing less than to back up angry drivers behind me, so if I'm riding in the roadway I'm going to give you as much space as I can, or else get out of the roadway ASAP. Thanks, please don't yell at me any more."	SeattleWA

German Guy, 21 looking for new pals to kill some time	Hello my name is Johannes (obviously) and I am looking for some new friends to get over my boredom. I've never tried to make friends over the internet before and I think you never lived in 21th century without trying that out. So here I am. Some information about me: I am working a full time job in a office, I would say it is my dream job and I am quite a career dude so I am working a lot. When I am not working I spend some time with gaming and if you are a gamer too that would be great but if not that's no problem. I am also reading a lot which I have re explored some weeks ago. My favorite music genre is Hip-Hop, but I am listening to Philharmonic, Trap and Electro too. I am also informed about the actual politic's in my Country and the important stuff in the world and if you want to discuss politic's or other sensible topics I am very open to this I would also love to talk to you about some deep stuff. However this Post is flaired with Ghostfree so I will answer to your Message but if i'ts just a Hi you will got a Hi back I hate it to carry conversation's just on my back and I will rarely do it so please be able to answer more 1 Word in our conversations. I also don't care about you'r Gender, political site or sexuality just be a cool and chilled person. Please forgive my grammatical mistakes I am obviously not a native speaker and I don't use English often. &#x200B; I look Forward to hear from you!	MakeNewFriendsHere

Need a magic shop for your campaign, don't know how to calculate travel time? Here's a website I SERIOUSLY reccomend.	http://5emagic.shop is a website I stumbled on about a couple of hours ago and it has already revolutionized how I write things. I'm not affiliated in any way with this site but it's so god damn good I really want people to use it. 5emagic lets you create magic shops, generates teleportation circle graphics as well as wizard spellbooks, detect magic aura colours, reincarnation tables, calculate travel time, and calculate Bounty/Rewards for optional quests! And that's just the *free* version, you can get more options if you subscribe to their Patreon! Seriously check them out, I'm having a blast experimenting.	DnD
The Fool Card	Anyone been reading or read through the fool card? It's not done just yet but literally couldn't get through the first 10 chapters because I was actually so annoyed with the main character. It's a great story I'm 100% sure. I just couldn't deal with how annoying she is. The fact is, is that I've met women like her, I've KNOWN people like her. Which is why is so triggering lol.

Ending of Apokolips War	I really liked this movie I‚Äôm just a little confused on the ending. Couldn‚Äôt have Barry just reset the timeline whenever he felt like it? Why did he have to wait until the end of the movie to do it? I get it was a last resort but I don‚Äôt see why because the world was shit throughout the whole movie, it‚Äôs hard to think that he went back to change reality when the Atlantans and Amazons were at war but didn‚Äôt do the same when Darkseid Knuckle Fucked Earth to shreds and only even thought about it when Constantine told him at the end? Also I guess they all die at the end? Like their timeline just fades and they‚Äôre at peace with it? Or are they going to be reincarnated onto a different life somehow? Movie was really good though.

Any way to bind throttle or forward/reverse thrust to the alt control scheme?	Right now I have, for the standard scheme, throttle up (R1) and down (L1). Which works across both schemes. I want to bind throttle axis or thrust forward/reverse to the right stick up/down in alt controls for better combat controls. As the options menu is setup now, unfortunately, if I make that bind to the stick it will apply to both schemes. The problem seems to be that in the alt section there‚Äôs no nested throttle controls. Am I boned or am I missing something?	ElitePS
I joined a new app for working various gigs. They seemed nonsensical at first, but now I realize the terrible truth behind the tasks I was given	I woke up early one Sunday morning, grabbed my phone, and began scrolling through the countless notifications I‚Äôd received during the night. It was my morning ritual, and I worked to sort through various texts, social media notifications, and emails. However, as I was doing so, one particular notification stuck out. It was an email from a company I‚Äôd never heard of ‚Äì Acheron Industries. **An Offer You Can‚Äôt Pass Up!** the subject read. Curious, I opened it. >*Dear Joshua Lowe,* > >*First and foremost, congratulations on being one of the select few to receive this offer! This is an exclusive position that we don‚Äôt extend to just anyone. Acheron Industries has just launched a new app called* ***Infernium****.* > >*Are you strapped for cash? Or maybe you just want to make a little on the side? Well, Infernium gives you plenty of money to burn. Our app is an invitation-only program that allows you to receive offers for easy gigs that pay extremely well. We‚Äôve received amazing feedback about the app, and our current users are raving about the lucrative amounts of money they‚Äôre making for simple jobs.* > >*If you‚Äôre interested in applying to be one of our exclusive users, then download Infernium in the app store and enter the following code when prompted:* **JLOWE18** > >*We look forward to working with you,* > >*Acheron Industries.* ‚ÄúFucking spam,‚Äù I muttered to myself, immediately moving to delete the email. However, I stopped just before pressing the little trash icon. My job didn‚Äôt pay all that well, and I‚Äôd been looking for an opportunity to make some extra cash. Maybe it was worth a look. Intrigued, I opened the app store and looked it up. It had a perfect 5-star rating, and all of the reviewers claimed to be making more from the app than they would at a full-time job. I suspected that they were fake, but the reviews weren‚Äôt rife with the spelling errors and repetitive phrasing one normally finds with sketchy product reviews. They all seemed to be from real people. I shrugged and downloaded the app. Upon opening it, I was immediately prompted to enter a code. Glancing back at the email I‚Äôd received, I entered the one they‚Äôd provided and was granted access. A new screen opened which asked me to create an account and provide my PayPal address. I was still skeptical but entered my information anyway. It didn‚Äôt ask for anything particularly personal, so what was the harm? Once I‚Äôd submitted my information, I was asked to accept their terms and conditions. I clicked the attachment and saw that the file was nearly thirty pages long. Deciding not to waste my time picking through legal jargon, I simply clicked *Accept*. The page disappeared, and the words ‚ÄúWe will contact you shortly‚Äù floated on a plain black background. I sighed and put my phone down. Maybe it was just a scam to get my contact information so they could sell it to some third party. I doubted anything would come of it. To my surprise, my phone rang less than a minute later. The caller ID displayed a 1-800 number that I didn‚Äôt recognize. ‚ÄúHi, is this Joshua Lowe?‚Äù a professional sounding man asked when I picked up the phone. ‚ÄúYes, it is,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThis is Liam with Acheron Industries. I‚Äôd first like to thank you for joining our new startup Infernium. I‚Äôll be your personal task manager for the app.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúhow exactly does this work?‚Äù ‚ÄúStraight to the point, I see. I like it.‚Äù Liam spoke quickly but annunciated clearly, sounding as if he‚Äôd done this a million times. ‚ÄúBasically, I‚Äôll text you the details for upcoming gigs. Typically, they need to be completed within a certain timeframe, so we‚Äôll give you as much heads-up as possible. Once you receive the details of the job, you simply have to carry it out. Payments will be sent to you via PayPal shortly after completion of the task. Aside from that, there‚Äôs nothing more you need to do.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù I asked, still suspicious of the app. It all seemed a little shady, especially since they randomly reached out to me via email. ‚ÄúPretty much. I will warn you that the tasks may seem strange and ambiguous. But I assure you that you won‚Äôt be doing anything illegal. The first two gigs are optional, so, if you feel uncomfortable doing them, you‚Äôre free to refuse. However, if you reject any subsequent tasks, then you‚Äôll be terminated as per the terms of service.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat sounds‚Ä¶ fine.‚Äù The idea of being able to reject my first two gigs made it seem at least a little more legitimate. ‚ÄúPerfect! I‚Äôll text you with details when the next gig becomes available.‚Äù Liam hung up without another word, and I was left wondering what kind of tasks they would ask me to do. I didn‚Äôt have to wonder long, because I received a text only two hours later. **Buy a bag of Peanut M&Ms. At 3 PM today, leave the package on a bench near the swings at Jaywood Park. No further action required. Payout: $300. Reply YES to accept.** I stared at the text in utter bewilderment. Three-hundred dollars to leave a bag of M&Ms at a park? What kind of gig was this? I figured I‚Äôd be buying groceries for people or helping old ladies move their couch. Maybe it was some kind of promotional thing. The task was strange to say the least, but I didn‚Äôt see any harm in it. I picked up my phone and responded ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù At that point, all I had to do was wait until 3 PM rolled around. I wondered how they would even verify if I‚Äôd completed the task. They hadn‚Äôt asked me to send a picture or any other kind of proof. But I figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt to give it a try. Jaywood Park was only a few blocks down the road. That afternoon, I stopped by the convenience store and bought a bag of Peanut M&Ms. Then I drove to the park and found a bench near the swings. I wasn‚Äôt sure how they wanted it exactly, so I just left it in the center of the bench with the label facing outward. I glanced around to see a mother sitting across the park and a couple kids playing on the swings. Shrugging, I got back in my car and left. When I got home, I looked at my phone and nearly dropped it in surprise. Acheron Industries had sent me three-hundred dollars via PayPal. My jaw dropped at the sight of the payment. How did they even know that I‚Äôd completed the task? Were they just assuming I had since it was so simple? I tried to put the thoughts out of my mind. If all the tasks were this easy, then I was bound to make plenty of money from the app. Hell, it was practically miraculous. At that moment, I decided it best not to ask questions. There was no way I could turn down this kind of money. Over the next several weeks, I received more and more esoteric tasks. They came pretty much every other day, and they were all equally confusing. At one point, I was asked to spray-paint the words ‚ÄúDO IT‚Äù on the rocky shore near a local river. I thought that it might be considered vandalism but figured the $500 payout was well worth the risk. Other tasks included laying a brick in the center of a random sidewalk, leaving a $200 tip for a waitress, and misplacing a book in a library. At one point, I was given the description of a man, including what he was wearing, and asked to find him at a local bar. Once I found him, I was supposed to buy him a few drinks then leave. All the tasks were like that ‚Äì strange little jobs that seemed to have no discernible goal. They confused me, and I often questioned what their purpose was, but I soon stopped caring. Watching the money roll in became addictive. It was almost like a game. I had to do stupid little side quests and was given absurd monetary rewards. At this rate, I could probably save enough money to retire by the time I was forty. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Then I received a text that left me absolutely bewildered. **At 5 PM today, find a man named Oliver McCoy near the corner of 3rd Street and Cedar Road ‚Äì Average height, white male, gray hair, jeans and a gray jacket. Purchase a small rosary and hand it to him. Say nothing. No further action required. Payout: $10,000**. I stared at the text for what felt like an eternity. Ten-thousand dollars? The gigs had been lucrative before, but this was completely insane. I glanced at the clock and saw that it was three-thirty. I didn‚Äôt have much time, and I didn‚Äôt have a rosary either. I immediately got in my car and drove to several stores. None of them had rosaries, but I finally found a small religious shop that sold them. I bought a cheap plastic one and raced to the location specified in the text, arriving there with only two minutes to spare. I parked and stepped out of my car to see a man pacing back and forth on the corner. He seemed agitated and was muttering to himself. Cautiously, I approached, trying to get a good look at him. He matched the description I‚Äôd been given in the text. ‚ÄúOliver McCoy?‚Äù I asked. He stopped and stared at me, his eyes wild. There was a frenzied look about him, and it appeared he hadn‚Äôt showered in weeks. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I reached into my pocket, produced the rosary, and handed to him. As soon as he saw it, tears welled up in his eyes. He took the rosary with shaky hands then immediately began to finger the beads and pray. Without another word, I left and returned to my car. When I got home, I sat on my bed and watched my phone, anxiously waiting for the next payment. One hour passed, then another. It had never taken this long for a payment to come through. Finally, my phone dinged and a notification appeared. Ten-thousand dollars had been sent to my account. I nearly shouted in joy. It was too good to be true. That night, I ordered a lavish amount of food and spent the evening relaxing. Now was a time for celebration. I turned on the TV and began flicking through the channels, trying to find something interesting to watch. As I was doing so, I came across a breaking news story. I flicked past it, but ended up returning, wondering what had happened. A local politician, Wyatt Stokes, had been assassinated. The news sullied my evening, and I almost turned the channel again. Stokes had been a good man, loved and respected by the local community. Many people thought he had a good chance at becoming president one day. Some had even likened him to Jesus. Apparently, someone had shot him while he was making a speech that evening. The newscasters claimed to have footage of the perpetrator being arrested. My drink fell from my hand and splattered across the floor as soon as they began to play the video. It was Oliver McCoy, the man I‚Äôd met only a few hours ago. As the police attempted to subdue him, he waved around the rosary, claiming that an angel had given him a sign to kill Wyatt Stokes. An icy feeling settled in my gut as the camera zoomed in on his frenzied eyes. Had I somehow been involved in this? Surely, it was just a coincidence. I tried to push the thought away, but a strange foreboding settled over me. Grabbing my laptop, I began searching for recent news. I looked up the name of the park where I‚Äôd left those M&Ms only to discover that a five-year-old had died there from an allergic reaction. Apparently, he had a peanut allergy and had torn into an unopened pack of candy he found without knowing what it contained. Shakily, I searched the name of the bar where I‚Äôd been sent to buy a random man drinks. A news story appeared detailing how a girl had been killed in a drunk driving accident near the bar. Feeling as if all the air had been sucked out of my lungs, I clicked on the article. The top of the page displayed a mugshot of the driver. It was the same man I‚Äôd bought drinks for. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said to myself, my voice barely above a whisper. I researched further and found an article about a local suicide. Some man had thrown himself from a local bridge. I recognized the location. The bridge crossed almost directly over the place where I‚Äôd spray-painted the words ‚ÄúDO IT.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be.‚Äù I felt as if I was in a daze. Had all of my tasks ended like this? Had they all been the first toppled domino in a horrible chain of events? I immediately picked up my phone and called Liam. ‚ÄúI want out,‚Äù I said as soon as he picked up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù ‚ÄúI want out. I don‚Äôt want to be part of the Infernium thing anymore.‚Äù The professionalism in Liam‚Äôs voice seemed to disappear, and he almost sounded snide. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôs possible,‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done. I quit.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is no quitting Infernium.‚Äù His voice was cold. ‚Äú[You belong to us now](https://reddit.com/r/travisliebert).‚Äù	nosleep

I mean, obviously I‚Äôll know, but I don‚Äôt think I care anymore. And yes, I know the answer is yes... I guess I just want someone to enable me, lol.	stopdrinking

Considering the quarantine and my plans for a new setup within a week or so, I think i‚Äôd love this idea. Is the community still alive and, seeing as how niche the game is, has it been overhauled enough throughout the years for it to garner attention?	Wizard101

Tempurpedic ProAdapt vs Breeze	"I am trying to decided which mattress to purchase (Between ProAdapt or one of the Breeze Models). I am mostly a side sleeper with back problems my girl is mostly a back sleeper therefore we decided on the medium firmness mattress to accommodate both of us. Reading reviews, I've seen most say that memory foam mattresses sleep hot which makes me feel that I should get a Breeze model. The issue I am having is the Breeze feels a bit more ""stiff"" due to the cooling layer and I feel like it would not feel as comfortable throughout the night. Does anyone have any experience with both of these mattresses and provide some input on which one might be a better option."	Mattress
My friend started a relationship with a guy who sexual assaulted me and she knows about it.	So to make it short: a former really 'good' friend of mine sexual assaulted me when I was sleeping 3 years ago(I woke up and stopped it). I since learned he done something similar many times to other girls... I learned that a good friend was secretly dating him last year. We all went to the same uni at the time. I told her about what he done and a she stopped seeing him. He charmed his way back in and now they are a couple and I havent seen her for almost a year because of that. The assaults happened before she knew him, so I know thats what she is telling herself. Pretending it didn't happen and doesn't want to face facts. It is also unfair that she should suffer from the consequences from what he has done...She is such a kind person and he is one of the most fucked persons I have ever meet and I really want whats best for her. I can understand it is difficult for her, when she loves him. I miss her and I think it such a sad sad situation. She reached out for meeting for coffee , but I don't know if I can, when we have to 'pretend' . Any advice?	relationship_advice

Returning to the game: what do I need to know?	So I'm looking to get back into the game after not playing for years (the newest card I have is from 2013).

[40][Analysis] _______'s Best Pitch to the Jury in FTC	With the F3 pretty much 100% confirmed to be Tony, Natalie, and Michele, there are solid predictions that Tony will get the majority of votes, Natalie will get some EOE votes, and Michele *might* get a few votes, if any. Is there any way Michele can come back from being a 0-2 vote finalist and capture a few more votes? It's highly unlikely she wins, but she may be able to scrape a few votes away from Tony and Natalie. I hope she brings up pre-game relationships as a key point in her FTC speech. As Survivor fans/players know, having a solid pre-game partner or group to play with in the game can be a tremendous advantage, like Tony and Sarah likely have. The jury probably realizes this advantage because (1) they've played before, and (2) a lot of them likely pre-gamed. However, I think it was mentioned that Michele had some sort of pre-game alliance with Nick and Yul, so this might not be a very strong point. Michele's game has been pretty similar to her Ka√¥h R≈çng game, emphasizing her social relationships and navigating different groups to get her to the end. Hardly as flashy as Tony's, or even Natalie's games. What's her best pitch to the jury to come out of this season as a zero vote finalist? Also, fun fact: Michele will be the only player this season to never be voted out of Survivor.	SpoiledSurvivor

[Poetry] Adam and Eve [Misc]	I haven't been able to get this one out of my head. There are so, so many layers of vulnerability, violence, frustration, loneliness, temptation, the list goes on. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this too--love it, hate it, agree/disagree with it, relate to it. It definitely struck a peculiar chord that resonated with me deeply, albeit from the perspective of the male gender. **TRIGGER WARNING - Abuse, domestic violence** >Is a man just an animal, and is a woman not an animal? > >Is the name of the animal power? > >Is it true that the man wishes to see the woman > >hurt with her own pleasure > >and the woman wishes to see the expression on the man's face > >of someone falling from great height, > >that the woman thrills with the power of her weakness > >and the man is astonished by the weakness of his power?

Disabled Veterans Unite!...?	Disabled vets what have you done to replace your income? I worry about having a roof over my head every day. I also am losing my health physically and may not even be able to work in a few short years. I‚Äôm by no means a frail woman. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and built pretty well. I was a Seabee Welder and loved every hard bit of it. But due to the training, and leaving things unchecked because going to medical was frowned upon, I have these physical conditions that the VA has decided to pay me versus fixing. I feel that I will not be able to do even the most minor things at this rate and I‚Äôm only 31. I‚Äôm not looking for a get rich scheme. Just something I can do at home possibly.	PTSDCombat

Travel Photographer Synology NAS Question	I recently had a hard drive with 3 months of images die on me and I'm over it. So I've been researching NAS and Synology keeps coming up. I'm looking at the Synology 4 bay NAS DiskStation DS918+ as my first one. But I have a big question regarding cloud. I'm looking for something where I can leave it at home connected to the net and access it while I'm in another country. Is that possible? How do I find out if a NAS has this support? The spec sheets are basically listing things I have no idea about. Thanks for any help.	synology
Did Forest Gump Play Disc Golf?	I watched Forest Gump again last night from start to finish. In the opening scene of he tucks the feather into a book (Curious George?) in his suitcase. In the top of the suitcase, held in place by the net, looks to be a golf disc? A driver at that. I can't imagine why. Unless Hanks or the props guy is a disc fan and was slipping in a personal bit. The thing is flat and round. There's a tube of toothpaste next to it, but I can't think of an item of personal hygiene that would look like that. I'm pretty certain Savannah didn't have a disc golf course at the time the movie took place. (We used to play in a town park.) Edit: Of course it's the paddle. After disc popped in my head, it didn't leave room for anything else.	movies
Finally lucid ‚Äî and my dad wasn‚Äôt having any of it	So I finally had a lucid dream. I was writing a story on a piece of paper and eventually wrote out: ‚ÄúYou are in a dream.‚Äù I proceeded to run around my house out of excitement. I told my dad (in the dream) that I finally recognized that I was dreaming, and he brushed me off and said, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you know that the whole time?‚Äù And then I woke up. When I wrote down that I was in a dream I felt this crazy rush in my head. It felt like I snapped into the dream all at once, but everything afterwards happened within seconds and then I woke up.

Looking for 2 build reccomendations (SL 30 and SL 120)	Hi! I always played souls pvp but never dived much into build creation. After a couple years of not playing it, I bought recently a copy of DS3 in ps4, as I always played on PC. But now the meta has changed a lot and I don't know what is a decent option to do pvp at low level like 30 at the Forest or Farron's Keep. Can someone recommend me a build for that level and other for SL 120? My only planned build is SL 60 STR using BK Greatsword, so maybe the lvl 30 build should be STR based too. Thanks in advance! PS: Just noticed the typo on the title :(	DkS3Builds
Sugar free Jello... pros and cons	"5'6"" 28m 260lbs here. I've always had a sweet tooth and have found myself turning towards sugar free jello here lately. I know that artificial sweeteners aren't good for you, but I'm wanting to lose quite a bit of weight and obtain a healthier lifestyle. I'm just now starting to try to get more active and start walking several times a week. In terms of sweets/cheats, I'm not going to be able to give them up. I'll be honest. My issue is portion control and I feel like for the most part jello is a guilt free item. But what exactly are the pros and cons of sugar free jello? Will this have a negative impact on my goals or is it a better alternative to mindlessly eating snacks? I'm new here, but already feel better seeing how supportive some of these communities are. Any tips or suggestions are very much appreciated."	loseit

Succesful Nebido story	Currently in the last few days of my third 1.000mg testosterone undecenoate (Nebido) shot. The protocol that my doctor has prescribed me is a 1.000mg shot every 7 weeks. That is around 142 mg of testosterone every week. Before I have used Androgel with no succes. Just a slight increase in libido but no morning wood. Fatigue was still present. The reason i started TRT in the first place is because of low libido, no morning erections, social anxiety, concentration issues (i was diagnosed with ADHD when i was 8 years old). Currently testing wether i have Klinefelters syndrome or not. Nebido works truly amazing for me. You have to be patient with it because the first shot did little to nothing for me. But right when i took the second shot i experienced the benefits for around 2/3 weeks. Now I am on my third shot and I experienced the benefits for almost fully 6 weeks. I experienced these benefits from TRT: \- I lost some bodyfat, but that is also from being in a caloric deficit. \- All my fatigue problems are gone! I dont need a nap anymore around 4 pm. That changed my lifestyle a lot! \- Everyday morning wood. Every. Day. \- Very high libido. I get horny around 4-5 times a day. \- Harder erections. My girlfriend also told me that my penis appears bigger when erect. \- Some increase in beard growth. The hair on my cheeks is also thicker. I know people have bad experiences with Nebido. That is because the standard protocol of 12 weeks. The optimal protocol for most people is around 6-7-8 weeks, though i dont recommed the 6 weeks protocol. It builds up a lot of testosterone on the long run -> long term problems. Feel free to ask my any questions regarding my TRT experience! I live in The Netherlands by the way so Sustanon, Androgel & Nebido are my only options.	Testosterone

Ding-Dong Ditch	It was a late Friday night when my older brother Mike dared me to ding-dong ditch Mr. Murphy‚Äôs house. Being the innocent younger sibling, I was always easily persuaded. I wanted nothing more in life than to earn my brother‚Äôs respect, so I accepted the dare. It was the first time I had ever ding-dong ditched. Mike agreed to accompany me because I was nervous. We quietly walked across the street, easily hidden by the darkness of the night. A full harvest moon hovered in the sky directly above the rooftop to Mr. Murphy‚Äôs house. I could feel my heart beating faster as we neared the porch. Mr. Murphy‚Äôs car was parked in the driveway, but the house was pitch dark. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be scared.‚Äù Mike whispered. ‚ÄúRing the doorbell.‚Äù My finger trembled as I pressed the dimly lit button. As soon as I heard the ding echo from inside, I turned and sprinted as fast as I could. Mike was waiting in the driveway and as I passed, like trickster older brothers do, he lifted his foot and tripped me to the ground. I laid flat on the cold pavement. The burning pain of skinned extremities was numbed by the rush of panic induced adrenaline. With each escaping step, I could hear Mike laughing his way home. Suddenly, as I tried to stand to my feet, the porch light turned on and I could hear the front door creek open. I had to quickly find a place to hide so I rolled underneath Mr. Murphy‚Äôs parked car. I held my breath. Fearful I would be found. It was silent, until I heard the most horrifying, vicious scream coming from the darkness beyond. Thumping footsteps approached, accompanied by the sound of scratching along the cold concrete. THUMP. SCRATCH. THUMP. SCRATCH. Louder and louder, the footsteps became with each advancing stride. As I peered out from beneath the car, the light of the full moon revealed two large, rigid feet, covered in long dark hair, descending into view. Sharp nails protruded from the toes, like monstrous claws conceived from a nightmare. A deep growl and midnight howl expelled from the larynx of the beast. I was able to escape that night, but Mike was not as fortunate. His distant laughter culminated into an agonizing cry, when he was caught by Mr. Murphy. That was the first and last time I ding-dong ditched. It was partly by choice, but primarily because my brother was no longer around to dare me to do so. I stay as far away from Mr. Murphy‚Äôs house as possible. Especially on nights when the moon is full.	shortscarystories
How do you keep your circulation going when in the operating room?	Hi everyone. I'm new to Reddit and I hope I'm doing this right. I'm a med student in Germany and have recently had my first surgery experiences in orthopaedics. The surgeons let me stand in the sterile area and sometimes even assist and I found it incredibly interesting. I could honestly imagine to work in this field in a few years. I just had one problem: dizziness, sometimes even syncopation. It didn't matter that much because I wasn't needed, but it shouldn't happen on a regular basis when you're a surgeon... So now I wonder if it is at all possible for me to enter a surgical field, or if I should rather pursue a career that doesn't involve operating... Do you have any general advice, experiences or opinions on this? Anything will be much appreciated, because I'm genuinely confused about what I could or should do in the next few years to come.	medizzy

‚ÄúBuck up, son, have some courage‚Äù says random YouTube stranger to a frightened teen worried for his grandmother‚Äôs safety.	Ok, happened last night. I was watching a video on YT, something related to COVID, and I expressed in the comments how I wish people would take this virus more seriously and comply with social distancing. Of course I got multiple replies from people about why we should forget all this worry and why it isn‚Äôt as bad as it sounds. And, well, I decided to engage and argue back. Oops. Get into it with this random dude for a while, civil discussion, not the angry people argument. But eventually to make my case, I explain about my grandmother. She is 86 years old. If she gets this virus, her chances of making it are significantly lower than those of a young, healthy person. It can still happen, she can still make it, but chances are quite slim. I told him I was scared because my uncle doesn‚Äôt listen to us, and he has a sore throat and yet is STILL hanging out with her every day. I told this stranger I‚Äôm scared that if she gets the virus, she could very well die, and this is why we need to take this stuff seriously. And he replied with: ‚ÄúBuck up, son, have some courage. Life will be so much more fruitful if you do.‚Äù Normally a nice sentiment, but right now? What the actual fuck? He talks about he himself is in an at-risk age category but he doesn‚Äôt worry because the virus is just one of many things that could kill him. That elderly people like my Grandma are going to die anyways because of their age. My grandma has a lot of life left in her. You wouldn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs 86 if you saw her. Don‚Äôt anyone ever tell me we don‚Äôt need to social distance because elderly people are going to die anyways. Oh yeah, and then he closed out his multi-paragraph response by saying I need to go listen to a podcast episode with Monty Python about looking on the bright side. Life pro-tip: don‚Äôt waste your time arguing with internet strangers. It‚Äôs not worth it. Life pro-tip 2: don‚Äôt go and tell a distressed person to ‚Äúbuck up‚Äù or ‚Äúhave some courage.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt work. TL;DR: I tried arguing with a stranger on YouTube about why we need to take this virus seriously. Oops. I explained how I‚Äôm scared for my 86-year-old grandmother and how if she gets this virus, her chances of making it are pretty low. He responded with ‚Äúbuck up‚Äù and ‚Äúhave some courage‚Äù and said she is going to die soon anyways. I‚Äôm never gonna argue with internet strangers again. Waste of my time. Stay home. Stop the spread. Stay healthy. Flatten the curve. Don‚Äôt do this for me. Do this so that not another person had to die of something preventable. God bless you and your families.	teenagers

Would uploading this fic be offensive?	This might be a weird question, but I want to hear people's opinions on it. Since 2017, I have been working on a particular Pokemon fanfic that is currently unpublished because it required such a large amount of work. I'm talking over 160 Fakemon (complete with Pokedex entries, Abilities and movesets), a brand new region and an entire cast of OCs kind of big. Just last month, I got to a point where I was ready to start writing...and then I realised that one of the Legendary Pokemon represented disease...and we're in a pandemic... So...is now not a good time? Would you guys be offended if something like this popped up during a pandemic? When I came up with this fic and put so much work into it, I had no idea that the world would face something like this by the time I was about to post it, but I've put so much work into this, and I'll be so frustrated if about 3 years of hard work goes down the drain. I keep thinking about how much backlash a TV channel in my country got when they played Contagion just as the virus started to spread. How long would it be safe to leave this after the pandemic ends? Maybe I should just write the fanfiction and post it when I'm finished. That'll be, like, 6 years down the line, based on past experiences with my writing speed (I'm joking, of course).	FanFiction

Looking for my first decent quality chef knife	Dear all, I cook a lot, and my knife is just not doing job. It is a tefal chef knife for 20 euros and I need something better. I'm considering the wusthof classic ikon or the global g2, but I'm open to other suggestions. Some information that might be useful. My hands are on the small side, but not to small. I'm more of a shopper than a rocker in the way I cut. I'm vegan thus i will not be cutting chicken. The hardest thing I cut is probably butternut squash, and pumpkins. I have no idea how to sharp a knife and an I have an hard time taking care of them. I live in Portugal Europe thus not every single knife is easy to order I can get the w√ºsthof classic ikon with an iron and a paring knife for 150 euros.

Just want to add my 2 eurocents	I want to review Weekend League - from perspective of european casual player. Last week i was locked down due to covid so i grinded solos and achieved ~96 ovr team. This week i decided to try PvP (yea i previously played like 5 pvp in season mode when i was <85, thats all its my 1st madden). Well, i ended 10-11 (no time for last 4 games). It was exciting experience. Pvp is completly different from solos. It gives more fun when you do stops, and pure satisfaction when i score (frankly i 'know' how to use one formation). Ofc Moss cheese is unhealthy, same as 1 play Dickerson/Sanders rushing td. Also i learned a lot, especially how to operate on defence. Definitelly i'll play next week. Just wanted to share, coz noone here cares about am. football. P.S. all i want to aske ea for is better servers coz its unpossible to kick fg/ make good kickoffs from east europe.	MaddenUltimateTeam

People need to stop taking pictures of people in public and complaining how nobody cares about the coronavirus.	Im so tired of seeing people take pictures of others who dared to leave their house, posting it on social media and complaining, just focus on your life, stop being so concerned with other people, it will not affect you if a stranger leaves their house, what will affect you is if you leave the house. If your that pissed off because other people chose to go outside, then stop being a hypocrite, its common sense that if your complaining and taking photos of people without consent, then clearly you are part of that group of people. It is none of your business that others go outside, its not your life to decide what people do, i‚Äôm not saying that its a good thing that people are not quarantined, but taking photos of people, complaining in social media will not change shit. I don‚Äôt care who disagrees or downvotes, its my opinion. For those who wont bother reading it, stop taking pictures of people, stop complaining, and stay home if your that afraid. Honest to god i didn‚Äôt know that people actually thought that once the lockdown was lifted people would actually stay in quarantine.	TrueOffMyChest

Building a PC for streaming console content	Hi recently a friend asked me for some help in regards of streaming. Because of the quarantine he aparently got money to spare an decided to splurge on streaming equipment. He got: a Streamdeck an elgato capture card (which states it needs a NVidia 10xx) usb-mic and -headset the problem now is he only got an old pc from work so no USB 3 which both the streamdeck and the capture card state the need of. Also in the Programm of the capture card states that his Radeon HD6450 is currently used or has an insufficient driver. Now since he is on the roll he decided to buy or assemble a new PC. He alloted around 1000‚Ç¨ for that since he won't need it for anything else except maybe some excel an browsing. Since i am a full on PC-Gamer i have no clue what kinda Hardware he needs to stay in the loop for a bit. My first step would have been the GPU since its the only thing i know at least a minimum and i would have recommended a GTX 16xx since the capture card doesn't specify an AMD alternative. Any help would be much appreciated. Also this is my first post on reddit so be kind guys.	buildapc
Read a file into memory	For some Cuda/C++ processing I need to read rather big text files with integers and complex numbers. But this is only a temporary solution; Later the data will come via Flink. For now I use textfiles for Performance testing. I created my own sturct into which i read the data line by line. For that I overloaded the read operator of ifstream. But that isn‚Äôt that fast at 0.000797ms/line. I have enough RAM for the whole file, is there a way to first read the file into memory and then access it with a ifstream (or similar stream)? Or is that already happening? How can I efficiently parallize this to ~75 Threads? Any Ideas? Thanks!	cpp_questions
Explaining maths through real world examples, can you be creative?	So I‚Äôm homeschooling my son due to corona and I notice that he keeps making the same mistake, when asked to convert 2.1 hours into minutes he sees this as 2 hours and 10 minutes and hence a total of 130minutes. I‚Äôve tried to find a way to explain this but I end up down a rabbit hole converting decimals into fractions and ‚Äúfollowing a set of rules.‚Äù I‚Äôm trying my best to give my son a relational understanding of maths and so I believe it would be best to give him a fun and memorable example to understand that 2.1 hours is in fact 126 minutes. I don‚Äôt know if this is the correct place to post this but I wanted to see if any creative mathematicians on here could help me to help my son understand. (He is 12 years old) Thanks in advance for any suggestions!	maths

Switches not working?	Hello, sorry if this is a dumb question but I just bought a home and don't really know where to start with this issue. I have double switches in the bedroom, one switch for fan and the other for the light on the fan. A few days ago, the fan switch stopped working. Then last night the light switch also stopped. I checked the breaker box outside and all looks ok. I reset that room anyway and still nothing. I also took off the switch plate and didn't see anything loose although no ground wires appear to be connected. What could the problem be? Thank you.	electrical

Faction-specific healing/revive particle effects?	I've noticed this a lot recently when watching some of the event twitch streams etc., but its also something that became apparent with the surge of recent content creator videos: **all healing effects are green**. For the sake of brevity - why?: * Green doesn't always align well with the factions from an immersion/art perspective * It makes for a bad distinction of friend vs. foe, especially during rezwars and/or if smoke is involved (is that an enemy resnade/healing nade?) **Proposal: Make all healing/revive particle effects faction-specific.** * this is already the case for shield bubbles (could be further emphasized for e.g. VS being more purple vs. NC), and it was done for the frag grenades * AOE heal, heal grenade/ revive nade etc. should follow the factions: red for TR, blue for NC, purple for VS * Optionally (don't know if feasible): The particle effects could follow the empire color settings the player uses instead (i.e. for those weirdos that play TR with blue friendly icons) *** Its a small QOL feature request, but I think it would add a lot for the distinction of the effects (gameplay, casting/commenting), and also add to the faction flavors. Sidenote: possibly smoke and/or flash effects could be faction-colored, too (so you know whom to thank/blame, and for smoke it may mask doritos a bit when spotted within).	Planetside
Stellaris Just Screwed Me in my 1st Play through lol	So I'm a console player and grabbed the game from game pass. Never played before but saw it was a 4x4, like sci fi and have had a on/off obsession with Civ since the 90's so gave it a go. Fast forward 25 hours and I'm in charge of a fairly prosperous space Civ. I play a fairly mellow style and in game year 2287 have never been in a war and have good relations with my neighbors. As a chilled player I have 2 fleets (for pirates) both at about 2.5k strength which I thought was fine. Now, out the blue, these A-Hole Fallen Empire dicks just declared war. So I order both fleets to the system that I can they're approaching. I then go to have a spy on the oncoming fleets (there's 2). One is 57.4K and the other is 52.7küòê So I'm doomed. I can see no possible outcome where I survive this insane mis match. I mean, tha F? How is this in anyway balanced? My fleet capacity is already 90/127 so it's not like it would even be possible to have a fleet that would equal a 10th of one of these guys fleets. Don't want to be gloomy but it seems all is lost. Or is there a glimmer of hope? Any bones experienced campaigners can throw me?	Stellaris

We instead got the useless ep 27 recap and boring ep 1 filler. They should have adapted chapter 3 instead of the filler episode and chapter 4 instead of the recap. The Ishval war arc should also be an episode longer, the Dublin arc should have an episode in plus as well , the Envy vs Ling and Lan Fan + Hohenheim scene with the robers should have been added too. So imo the series should have been 67 episodes long ( without the recap and filler)	FullmetalAlchemist
A Simple Addition to Playlist Vendors	"Tl;Dr at the end You've probably seen it, I've seen it; the consensus surrounding Zavala, Shaxx, and Drifter's inventories is that they've grown stale and could use a complete ""vendor refresh"". It's a sentiment that I can agree with, but I also realize that it'd need some diversion of resources on Bungie's part to pull off, so I'd like to put forth something simpler yet more satisfying, in my opinion. Seasonal Curated rolls. Now wait, you might be thinking, isn't that already the idea behind the Pinnacle/Ritual/Pursuit weapons today? Yes and no. Let's back up a bit. When Forsaken launched, every new weapon (i.e every weapon with a Forsaken sigil in its thumbnail) came with both a set of randomly rolled perks as well as a ""Curated"" roll - a version that came pre-masterworked with a particular stat and a fixed set of perks that the dev team felt meshed well with the gun. Not all of them felt necessarily like the ""God Roll"", and some missed the mark entirely (looking at you, Transfiguration), but they generally felt satisfying to use and often came with a set of perks that the base gun cannot roll with (ex. Age-old Bond with Fourth Time's the Charm + Rampage). As of this writing, only certain Forsaken-era weapons can actually drop Curated rolls, which you can see on sites like light.gg and they state ""Not all Curated rolls drop in-game"", which is a bit of a shame in my eyes, seeing as there are some pretty sweet rolls in the database itching to be released into the wild, like the Gambit shotgun, Parcel of Stardust: this bad boy has Full Choke, Assault Mag (which it can't roll naturally), Opening Shot, and Quickdraw. It also cannot drop naturally, but it could have an avenue into players' hands if we look two of its other Gambit weapon brothers; Trust and Bad Omens. These two are also Gambit weapons with Curated rolls that don't simply drop out in the wild, but can be acquired in-game...via Infamy resets. Now here's where I'm going with this; every season you could offer up ""new"" (Year 2 of course but just work with me here) Curated weapons from the Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit loot pools as aspirational content via Vanguard rank-ups and Valor/Infamy resets. Of course, some of the currently unused curated rolls are, for lack of a better descriptor, hot garbage (though the Gambit ones are honestly really solid for the most part). Luckily, Bungie has shown that they can easily alter curated rolls for weapons that already drop; they did it for Warden's Law, and I think they did it for Trust, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. It'd be simple enough to tweak the unused ones, certainly simpler than designing a ritual weapon. Tl;Dr, release Y2 Curated rolls as seasonal goals."	DestinyTheGame

How I turned the DM‚Äôs homophobia against him to defeat The Great Evil.	"To start with, a little disclaimer : as a girl, I had heard for years that the RP world was very straight man-centric and often misogynist, but I had never encountered that before. This specific DM was an unfortunate encounter which didn't deter me from continuing DND and other games with better quality people. It was a one-shot at a library event, with a bunch of strangers who were equally excited for a night of adventuring. A bunch of DMs presented their tables, and we got to pick which one we'd like. The one I chose was based on a fantasy cloak and dagger series by Pierre Pevel, with high dragons masquerading among humans to mess with politics. The combat system also relied on playing cards, which seemed really fresh and exciting. And it could have been, were it not for the DM. He had prepared characters for the players (good call for a oneshot) but seemed pretty upset when neither me nor the other girl from the party picked the busty musketeer lady with doe eyes. Actually, the girl's bf picked her and ended up playing as a socially awkward genius with a lisp ; great character, but not the one the DM had envisioned. I went for Javier, the attractive, flirty spaniard who was kicked out of the army for sleeping with the sergeant's wife ; when asked to describe him, I decided I wanted him to have a wonderful mustache and to be ""perfectly rotund : a wonderful sphere of a man, with facehair that would make Dali weep "". DM gritted teeth at that, and told me ""No, read again : he's attractive."" First big red flag of the evening, but I shrugged it off and insisted. ""He's round and fat and beautiful, with a voice like Pavarotti."" I did theater for some time and proceeded to do a rather hilarious impersonation of an opera barytone with a spanish accent. It's all in good fun, right ? Right. The DM tells me that if I change the character, I have to roll again for charisma. He asked this of nobody else. I roll 6 on a D6, improving Javier's original 5. He frowns. ""Fine. His shape is so unusual that it draws the eye, I guess."" We share side glances with the other players. Yikes, but you know what? We'll make our own fun. The story proceeds, with mysterious disappearances that we must investigate. We get railroaded a lot, with PNJs refusing to talk to us until it's ""the right time"", travelling times being conveniently too long to fit in our planning, and male characters being so stricken by the Busty Lady that they just offer clues. It's a one-shot, so we don't mind ; no time for an open-world exploration. Still, the DM has a list of prepared monologues and detailed dialogues between PNJs ; it's a little over-dramatic to my taste, but hey, the DM should also enjoy himself and it's not too badly-written. The turning point comes when we take a prisoner working for the high dragon kidnapper ; he's tied to a chair in an ""interrogation cell"", where the DM takes an unconfortable time describing the torture instruments at our disposal. ""So, what do you wanna do ?"" I don't like this vibe, and from the looks on the players' faces, nobody does. We've all played in a very cheerful, collaborative way with a lot of jokes ; a live torture scene fits as well as a Requiem in the middle of a party playlist. ""I seduce the prisoner"", I state loudly. The DM laughs. ""Right, like good cop bad cop. You bring him a glass of water‚Ä¶"" ""No"", I cut him. ""I go on full sultry mode. I'm a vision of heaven in this dark cell. I'm posing. Sure, I'll bring him a glass of water, but also I delicately touch his cheek and tell him he has so much to live for."" The DM blanks. ""It's a man"", he says like I'm an absolute idiot. ""You're a man too."" My turn to grit my teeth. My dude, I have seen bards roll to seduce mountain-sized dragons before, but you're gonna be a bitch and bring homophobia to a fantasy world ? Not on my watch. I shrug. ""I never told you how I had apologized to the sergeant for bedding his wife, right ? I romanced him too. So I'm gonna go and romance that prisoner with my 6 charisma."" The DM's eyebrows make knots. ""He won't let you touch him"", he spits. ""He fears you."" Fair enough. ""I serenade him from a distance."" The scene is hilarious ‚Äì four musketeers standing in a Bastille cell while one of them is playing mandoline on his knees ‚Äì I do take the time to compose a short rhyming sonnet about how he should tell us what he knows so we can defeat mankind's foes, and it's better to spend the night with a spaniard joker than an iron-hot poker. ""Fine, roll for it."" Little note on the system : he usually sets a difficulty, and if it's inferior to our stats, we don't even need to roll. Otherwise, we add the dice result. I ask how much is required ‚Äì convincing our boss that accidentally murdering a guard was an honest mistake was only a 6. ""A 300"", he laughs. ""You're a MAN. If SHE wanted to try, though‚Ä¶"" He points at the guy playing Busty Lady, who has already established that she didn't like using her charms. ""I have no idea how to do this"", the player says. ""It's fine, DM replies. For you, it's a 1."" The player refuses. ""She doesn't like to do that. She just stands and claps in rythm to Javier's song."" DM is livid, and takes a second to fold his notes. ""Alright, he begs you to stop singing. I'll tell you anything, he screams, just keep the pervert away from me!"". The vibe switches instantly. The other girl looks at her BF, I look at her, we look at the DM. It's like we silently formed a pact of ""Well, Fuck That"". The adventure is nearing its end ; we find the mansion of the high dragon lady kidnapping nobles for Nefarious Purposes that were never clearly stated. Conveniently, there's a party going on. ""You reckon that if you manage to stealthily mix with the crowd, you might be able to find the kidnapped countess somewhere. The Dragon-Destroying McGuffin is probably here as well, but it would take a while to find it."" Time to shine for Javier. ""I walk to the high dragon lady and ask news of her marriage"", I state. DM is baffled. ""That's not stealthy."" I argue that it's a party, and that enquiring about our hostess is only polite. ""Fine. She icily tells you that her marriage is open as ever since her husband is insufficient, but that you're too fat for her taste. What a shame, she says. If only you had retained the shape you had long ago."" I smile. ""I find your husband perfectly sufficient."" DM and high dragon lady both choke. ""You can't have fucked her husband. It's not possible."" I insist that it is, especially since she just mentioned an open marriage (which is ludicrous in the society he painted, but hey : he brought it up) and I did. I bring up cheeky details that have him fuming before long. He has completely forgotten about the party or the other players, and this goes on for quite some time. Dragon lady calls the guards because I'm being a filthy liar, he has me fight them off, solo. About 20 minutes later, when I have only 1 HP left, Busty Lady politely coughs. ""I hit the dragon on the head with the Dragon Destroyer McGuffin"". ""What ? You don't have that."" ""Yeah, I do. The dragon lady has been busy with Javier for 20 minutes. We've searched the mansion in the meantime."" DM protests that he was gonna come back to them at some point, but the library is closing and everyone is pretty done with this shite. Busty Lady argues that with all the guards clobbering a bisexual musketeer, it wasn't very difficult to move around. We can see the pain in the DM's eyes as his Big Boss Fight slips away from his hands. After a bunch more arguing, and pressed by the library lady to pack up, he surrenders. ""Fine"", he says again glowering. ""But she kills you in a final gesture."" It's a oneshot and I definitely won't play with that guy again, so I roll with it. I improvise a dramatic death monologue as I clutch my chest, but it's the other girl from the party who has the last word. She's been good fun the entire adventure, playing her stern, battle-hardened musketeer with few words and always diving headfirst into combat. ""I kiss him"", she says as we pack and the DM leaves without a word. ""I kiss him on his mouth as he dies, and our mustaches touch, and it is beautiful."" We shared a burst of laughter that lasted until long after we left the library, and we parted ways. I haven't seen her nor her boyfriend again, but I sure hope they're also somewhere having fun and tearing apart stereotypes. &#x200B; by GreenPineapple"	AllThingsDND
Sadness, depression & loneliness is fine. Hate and bitterness is where you should draw the line	This may sound a little counterproductive but let me just explain. If you‚Äôre ugly and generally unsuccessful with the opposite sex (like me) it‚Äôs actually PERFECTLY fine to be sad about that. Lots of people on reddit and subs like this and the dating advice one, tell people in my position to not care, and focus on our lives etc. Well, I disagree. Our bodies, hearts and minds literally force us to fall in love, seek sex and companionship. Unless you‚Äôre a literal psychopath, there‚Äôs no escape! You‚Äôll go to college/work... there will be cute girls/boys in your class/workplace or even just customers. You‚Äôll be attracted. It‚Äôs human nature. And when you‚Äôre generally plain or not anything special, being lonely and not sexually active you‚Äôll get sad and depressed. This doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person and reddit is confusing because it make you feel like a bad person for wanting love, companionships and even just sex - all of which are natural. Me? It‚Äôs almost been a week since I drag myself out of redpill/MGTOW stuff. It‚Äôs been easier than I thought, bad things about women have creeped up on me, but I just thought of examples of girls who AIN‚ÄôT like the bad ones and I was able to get over it. My resentment and bitterness has actually left, however sadness and general depression has stayed. Like - it sucks that not even ONE cute girl has liked me, asked me out or anything you know, when my friends have multiples girls hitting them up, GF‚Äôs, FWBs etc. And I don‚Äôt... it hurts and anyone in my position should feel sad and depressed if you‚Äôre a person with basic human emotions. However, if you let these thoughts an feelings marinate into hate and anger towards women/men, well, then you have a problem. It‚Äôs not right to hate on people for not liking you, they‚Äôre free to do so! I‚Äôm a pretty normal guy. I pulled myself out of that shit and I reconnected with a female friends, I‚Äôm feeling much better but when my friends talks about sex I definitely feel sad and left out. Depression and sadness are fine. Hate and bitterness makes you the creepy, weird incel loser.	exredpill

Enerveration and dmg immunities	If a warlock were to cast and succeed on enerveration (deals 4d8 necrotic and they heal half of that) or a similar spell against a creature with immunity to necrotic dmg, would they still be able to heal half the damage or would it nullify that altogether? im assuming they wouldnt be able to but wanted some other thoughts on it. EDIT: and also kinda related, if they had Resistance, would they heal for the same ammount or half of the half damage it took.	DMAcademy
Inventory Wiped - Can't Interact w/ anything in the world	Everything has been fine in the last week of playing until the last 30 minutes. First of all Realms started lagging (Happens a few times a day yet isn't my internet) and I decided to relog to see if it was my Internet. After doing various speed tests it wasn't an issue on my side. The lag continued so I closed and reopened the realm. I can currently load in after an extreme delay on chunk generation yet my inventory is cleared and I can not open any item such as my chests, brewing stands and furnaces. This is honestly frustrating but what is the actual problem? I'm super close to just cancelling my realms subscription because this has honestly frustrated me.	realms

"Between COVID-19, Archaeology, DXP, Mobile/iOS beta, Mod Warden's promises (which are actually coming true) and VERY successful Ninja updates, we might be in a resurgence for RS3.

Can we hear what the company plans to do to address the poor performance of the servers so they can handle a better load of players?

Jumper T16 range	Hi all, At the field I've been flying, my Spektrum Racing Drone sat (SPM4649T) lost signal so the quad came down (Using my trusty DX8) and I decided to replace the gear with a Jumper T16 tx and a Jumper R1+ RX. Now I still get a 'low RSSI' warning (Set to 52dB) at about 120m (\~400 feet) away and 10 m (\~30 feet) altitude. What range are you getting with the Jumper T16?

What are some debunked theories that you're glad were wrong?	To me, the theory that the Yonko had no bounties always made absolutely no sense at all. The only idea behind it was that the Yonko were too strong for any bounty hunters to defeat them, but that just doesn't logically follow with how the World Government operates. First of all, that's basically an admission that these people are too powerful for the World Government to defeat, and that they're more or less above the law. This completely doesn't vibe with the sense of absolute control over the world that the WG likes to front. Secondly, these people weren't *born* Yonko, they *became* Yonko. Meaning they had long careers of piracy before reaching the status, and would have accumulated a bounty. Would the world government just rescind someone's bounty because they feel like nobody can handle them? Or would they put a big price on their heads in the hopes that someone incredibly strong, or maybe a group of incredibly strong people, would go out and bring them in? The whole theory was just completely illogical, and it was a good day when the chapter came out that revealed Blackbeard's bounty. How about you guys? Any theories that you are glad didn't come true?

Wife has boyfriend, contacted lawyer.	My wife has taken advantage of me for the last time, today I contacted a lawyer. She is a taker, never a giver and I have nothing more to give. My giving well is empty after she always drew from it but never replenished the reservoir. A giant weight has been lifted, I'm 40 with a 17 year old son who will be a senior this year. I'm hold fast for the next six months, I want to see if the housing market tanks so I can keep the home, and finish raising my son in it. Only 60K in equity, I need the market to correct 25% so my mortgage will be underwater when I file. I have a good rate, screw selling the home and it's in my name. We have 5 acers of land in the hills, worth about 60K, but the well doesn't work, so I think I can get it down to 45K in worth, which equals out debt. I want to keep the house, keep my land, keep the debt, and she can go draw from her bum of a boyfriend's well. Have fun you toxic POS, the war has begun!	Divorce
Threatening Jury Votes Strategy	"This is a strategy I've wondered about while rewatching RI and other seasons and I don't know of it's even allowed. After the merge in RI, Ometepe is up 7-5 and vote out one of their own. Now 6-5, Zapatera works like crazy to try and get one of them to open up their eyes and see that they are brainwashed robots. Alas, they don't and the get Pagonged. My idea for a strategy is this: After the first Zapatera member gets picked off and the numbers are 6-4, they see the writing on the wall and are pretty much sitting ducks. They know Rob is completely in control and brainwashed his fellow 5 Ometepe members. What if they go up to Rob and say, ""We know you're in control, if you don't take put a few Ometepe people before you tale all of us out, the 4 of us will vote against you at FTC."" Let's just say it's not a bluff and they will follow through with it. That would force Rob to do something, because if someone is definitely getting 4 votes at FTC, then all they need is 1 more and hes screwed. I've only seem s1-22 and s38-40. Has this strategy ever been used or thought of? Is it allowed? What are your thoughts?"	survivor

In your personal opinion, what is the least useful perk card?	I haven‚Äôt looked through every perk card with this question in mind, but just off the top of my head Hydro Fix seems like one of the least useful cards. It reduces thirst from chems, which is such a minor thing imo. I always have dozens of purified water on hand, and I only have 3 small purifiers. I don‚Äôt use chems often though, so maybe it‚Äôs more useful than I make it out to be. The card that increases caps from cap stashes also seems pretty useless. Like yeah, extra caps are good, but I very rarely actually find a stash while just exploring.	fo76

CAN KONAMI RECLAIMING THE THRONE WITH PES 2021?!	well as we all know guys there are lot of problems with pes 20 mobile and console too, according to me the 3 main problems are:- 1. THE REFREES- as we all know and have experienced when we commit a foul even if it is a shoulder puch but too hard, or a tacke the refree will always blow the whistle for a foul but when AI does it its like the refree was talking to someone and didn't even notice, fouls are not given away especially in the penalty box, wether the keeper comes and commit a late challenge or dive to early to trip the player rather than collecting the ball, freekicks and penalities are rarely given away if any player wants to improve the gamplay it's not possible as the refrees are totally upto the coding in which the user don't plays any part. 2. THE RESPONSIVENESS- the resposnse of player when we go for a banger or a rocket and it hits the defender and gets deflected is very poor as the player still needs to press and run to collect the ball but i noticed it stops for 1 or 2 seconds and goes in the opposite direction or don't even move when shot is deflected. 3. PASSING- passing has been getting poor everytime short passes are looking like through passes and player just stops for a second and the ball is out of play you play a simple short pass when trying to build up the player will pass it to hard that the other player can't even get to the ball, same with through passing, as the best way to win in superstar is to play short passes and create spaces, the passing seems to lack in some areas which also can result in scripting or a part of scripting, still it does not happen very often except the other two problems. THINGS THAT MAKE PES BETTER: 1. THE BALL PHYSICS- as pes has improved the ball physics a lot and that is why we can experience more real life gameplay as the passing plays an impotant role in winning the game and in the build-up PES has given us a slow pacy gameplay like real life pass and move, pass and move create spaces like gameplay which is really good. THINGS TO IMPROVE: 1. THE LICENCES- the main thing realism PES has delivered really well over the past years, yes there are still flaws but they've improved in there gameplay according to me, but the main thing that makes FIFA better than pes is licences pes needs so many top teams licence, liverpool, madrid, chelsea, dortmund, athletico, manchester city, mostly premier leagues whereas FIFA only lacks in juventus license and PES has started gaining licence and are now focusing on that by buying the bayern, juventus and manchester united one so hopefully they can buy more and they will. THESE POINTS AND REVIEWS ARE MY EXPERIENCE AND ALSO SOME PEOPLE ALSO COMPLAINED AND APPRECIATED THIS ON THIS SUB-REDDIT SO I THOUGHT IT'S BETTER TO TELL WHAT ARE THE 'ADVANTAGES' AND 'DISADVANTAGES' AND OF COURSE EVERY GAME HAS MANY FLAWS AND PLUS POINTS. IT'S BETTER TO DISCUSS THESE OR ANY TYPE OF ISSUES IN THE GAME LIKE THIS WITHOUT RANTING OR ABUSING THE DEVELOPERS WHICH EVERYONE WILL FIND APPROPRIATE AND WE CAN FIND THE SOLUTIONS ALSO, SO I REQUEST DON'T ABUSE OR RANT. THANK YOU SOO MUCH FOR READING THIS AND FOR YOUR TIME, STAY SAFE, HAVE A NICE DAY :)	pesmobile

[S3E5] Question about Villanelle's mom	"I just rewatched the scene where Villanelle's mom first comes home, she sees V and says ""my baby is alive!"" and goes to hug her while crying. But I noticed that while she's making the right expressions and sounds, not a single tear falls. The crying doesn't seem genuine. In fact, it seems like beforehand, when she first sees V, she's calculating her next move and how she wants to play things. I don't think she was ever for a second happy to see V, which aligns with their last scene together when she asks V to leave. I was thinking this especially about the final scene between V and her mom. Is her mom a psychopath? I know we didn't get much exposure to the character of her mom, but her mom seems more psychopathic than V, in my opinion."	KillingEve

Rules question: When deep striking or using concealed positions do you only measure horizontal distance or also vertical?	"Here's the situation: I was playing a friendly game with a buddy who is new. He was deep striking some inceptors and asked if he could set them up on top of a building that was within a few inches of my troops horizontally, but was more than 9"" away when you take vertical distance into account. I told him he couldn't and he was cool with it but now I'm not sure if I'm right or where I can find clarification. Also I can tell him that I goofed if I was wrong. So TL:DR; when doing deep striking, concealed positions, or other abilities that require you to be more than 9"" away is it purely horizontal or can they go onto a building? I seem to remember reading that you couldn't during a discussion of the FLY keyword since it ignores vertical distance when charging but I'm not sure. I also should really figure this out since I'm building a jump pack heavy Blood Angels list."	Warhammer40k
