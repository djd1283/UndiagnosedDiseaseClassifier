Frustration	This post comes from a place of frustration, i'm tearful and angry and confused and fed up. I've been dealing with fatigue and joint and muscle pain for nearly a year. I've seen a physio, dietician and a rhuematologist. I've had every blood under the sun done. Nothing, no answers. I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I do my best to get what i need in my diet even if i'm currently overweight (and working to bring it down.) With no conclusive results i'm told to just keep losing weight and keep exercising and it should just go away. But it's not, and god it makes me want to scream that some people can treat their bodies like utter shit and be just fine, but I try my best to look after mine and I'm falling apart. I'm not looking for advice, i'm just tired, and frustrated, and needed to share this with people who would understand.	undiagnosed
Chronic Pain Community Discord Server	February 21, 2020, marks the two year anniversary of the Chronic Pain Community Discord server! We are a server dedicated to supporting members in the chronic pain community, both individuals with pain and caregivers. Our server is a place to connect with individuals from all over the world who genuinely understand what it is like to live with chronic pain, or care for someone with chronic pain, on a daily basis. We connect through our experiences, successes, rants, hobbies, and so much more. Our server promotes healthy coping mechanisms and beams positivity even though many of us deal with difficult situations. Each week we post questions to help members focus on positive aspects of their life. &#x200B; This year we have introduced a new addition to the server - a featured condition each week! Members are welcome to discuss their own experiences with the featured condition, coping mechanisms they use, informative papers, and ask questions. &#x200B; Because we feel that the privacy of both individuals with chronic pain and caregivers are important, we have private channels for each role (success stories, rants, and more) as well as joint channels (general chat, hobbies, music, an advice channel to ask one another questions, and more). &#x200B; If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me! &#x200B; Server link: [https://discord.gg/6HYgNCR](https://discord.gg/6HYgNCR)	undiagnosed

Berkeley + UC Campus Crowdsourcing Platform - Get Global Feedback!	Do you or a family member have an undiagnosed medical problem? We understand the emotional cost to individuals and families is staggering, and we’d like to help bring your story to the “crowd”. Medical crowdsourcing is the ability to aggregate more information from people of all backgrounds, ideas and experiences to potentially provide answers. This has been done through early online platforms like CrowdMed and in Lisa Sander’s Netflix show “Diagnosis”. We are a group of Berkeley students with an idea. The goal is to create an integration of students across the California campuses coupled with an innovative crowdsourcing platform for people with undiagnosed conditions to garner additional insight, aside from the sometimes frustrating medical system. Our crowdsourcing builds on the efforts of Sander’s “Diagnosis” through a sustainable, contemporary and more direct form of crowdsourcing - a Youtube series that highlights one person at a time, detailing their symptoms, past medical history, tests taken, etc. (or through anonymous Youtube videos or Facebook posts if desired). We’d be leveraging the wisdom of international medical professionals as well as potentially millions of strangers in this way, unlike current webpage crowdsourcing sites, hoping to provide a faster and larger form of crowdsourcing. If you’ve sought answers from countless specialists, and still have an undiagnosed condition that you want to share through our platform, please contact [ucbdiagnostics@gmail.com](mailto:ucbdiagnostics@gmail.com).	undiagnosed
Having a hard time..	Hey everyone I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on my situation. I am not healthy mentally, I mean it very obvious but I dont have the time to go and spend weeks with a therapist. So I have a problem with my moods. I'm not going to just assume that I have bipolar disorder but I do believe that its something like that. My moods will switch throughout the day. Either small petty things can set me off to be angry with everyone around me or make me so sad that I think myaler into depression. I take zoloft because I also have bad anxiety and depression. It helps with my anxiety but not for my moods. I'm not asking for a diagnosis but does this sound familiar?	undiagnosed
A Call to Action - Help my favorite undiagnosed charity win $10,000.	Admins, feel free to contact me if this is not allowed, and I will gladly delete. Alright so there's this new contest happening online called My Giving Story. People vote on the charity that has been the most giving, and first place wins $10,000. I have nominated a charity called U. R. Our Hope. They're a registered, 501 (c) non-profit that works with rare and undiagnosed patients to provide resources, emotional support, and help navigating the medical system. Before I had my hEDS diagnosis, they held my hand and kept my sanity intact every step of the way. They even helped me get a Marfan/TAAD panel when I had no income and no health insurance. They maximize every sparse resource they have to help as many patients as they possibly can. But as their client list grows, so too does their need for resources. Simply stated, what I want you all to do is . . . vote! You can do it without even leaving your bed. By the way, I won't see any of this money, as it all goes directly to them. Voting does NOT does require you to purchase anything, provide any information (personal or otherwise), or sign up for anything. So PLEASE VOTE! Sharing on social media would be a bonus. I want U. R. Our Hope to ☆WIN☆ so they can help as any patients as possible. It could change lives!! ♡ Thank you!

Obsessed with counting... anything	Ever since I was a kid, I have always been extreme concerned with even numbers/distribution of things and finding some sort of balance to things. For example, when I was young, maybe around 11, I remember going through this time where I was obsessed with how many times I blinked. I had to blink in twos and would do this over and over because I couldn’t take my mind off of it. I have always, to this day, counted letters in a word while reading, counted how many words are within and sentence, and how many letters are within each word within that sentence. For example, a sentence like “I am Sam Adam” is very pleasing to me because the sequence of letters goes 1 2 3 4 letters within the 4 words. However, a sentence like “where is Samantha?” Has absolutely no pattern or balance to it with the 5 2 8 sequence of letters within the 3 word sentence. Another thing I have always done in the back of my head is count random number sequences that please me. My fav number is 16 for some reason, I like that it’s even and I like the sound of saying it “sixteen”. So in my head often times throughout the day I will count in my head “13, 14, 15, 16” and find some sort of comfort in it. If I look at an object... imagine an apple tree with 5 apples on it. I will deconstruct the item visually into compartments.... for example, the leaves as a whole would be one item, the trunk as a whole would be one item, and the 5 separate visual apples would be 5 separate compartments. Making the whole apple tree a 7 part item, which I do not like as it is not even. To accept the item and have it not bother me so I can move on, I may allow myself then to consider the apple tree as one whole item so I can say it is an 8 piece item even though I know that doesn’t make sense There are many other things I do along this line. I was raised within a family who doesn’t much believe in mental health care. I find this way of thinking to be absolutely exhausting at times but I can’t bring myself to stop. I find it annoying when people prance around saying that have ocd about things, but, do I have some sort of ocd? Am I just extremely over active in my brain? Thank you for reading	undiagnosed
Is anyone allergic to immunoglobulin E?	Years ago I spoke to my doctor at the time about getting an allergy test, besides the dander of my animals of course but one of the things I’m allergic to is my IgE. If you know it’s response in the body you know it has to do with allergies. Allergic..to..my allergies? Please someone make sense of this for me. It’s got me puzzled, and new symptoms daily...sounds bonkers... I’m going through hell at the moment “Fibromyalgia” and “sleep deprivation” and don’t forget the “mental health” related bs. Video to come once I feel better. Slept the past two days away... not depression related, pain related. Ironically my undiagnosed “diagnosis” has to do with mental health but I believe with a trigger; an allergy or such is what set me into a cycle of flair ups for the last four years, but as I’ve gone through it, all of my warped memories (trauma related as is my UD diagnosis) My shits fucked up. I’m going to do a video on it and I’ll edit this, anywhere my fingers feel like tight elastics and my foot hurts, yes just one.” If you think any of this sounds familiar comment🤘🏻 How about the allergy to IgE? ANYONE 😅😅 BONUS : Gardner diamond syndrome? Bonus bonus : scleroderma?	undiagnosed
I fucking hate doctors	I just saw a neurologist for these weird fainting episodes and he stopped me a few minutes into the appointment to tell me that I’ve had tests don’t in the past & since they all came out negative that means I have anxiety. He then MANSPLAINED SOMATIZATION to me. I was so pissed off. Like yes, I was so confused with I hit that car in the parking lot. It was definitely. That other time, when I passed out behind the wheel, that must have also been anxiety. The time I was with friends and threw myself on the couch and had this weird episode with extreme pain and sort of loss of consciousness (that had deja vous of the second time). The time last week, when my GP told me I had to go to the ER cause I had this weird confused episode (that was like a long drawn out episode of that first time). Those must have all been fucking anxiety and nothing else. He is a fucktard and I hope one day he wakes up with all my symptoms and illness and that no one will ever help him. That all doctors tell him that he’s somatic. That’s what doctors deserve. The worst of the illness that they leave their patients with.	undiagnosed

Participation	I'm researching Undiagnosed conditions. I myself have had a condition which was life threatening, and took a long time to diagnose. This has inspired my master's thesis. I need participants who are prepared to have a Skype interview with me. I must stress I have no influence over your diagnosis, and I do not have the expertise to diagnose you. I am trying to gather information of experience in the hope it might inform the way people are managed during diagnosis. If you would be prepared to participate there are some important things that are important. You must be over 18, you must have a physical condition which you have been waiting to be diagnosed for longer than 3 months. Finally you must have had at least one objective finding e.g. a blood test, physical measurable symptom, biopsy.	undiagnosed

ULQ Pain UNDIAGNOSED 4+ Weeks!	Wondering if anybody has any thoughts as to what could be causing substantial and moderate ongoing upper left quadrant pain. My cat scan and my MRI conflict each other one says kidneys are atrophic and chronic renal disease is present while the MRI says everything is fine. Doctor can feel a mass in my ribs however it did not show up on MRI either. Small umbilical hernia also did not show up on MRI however is palpable and seen on CAT scan and ultrasound. On going for 4 weeks. Had colonoscopy they were unable to complete so redoing next week with a two-day prep instead of one. Nothing helps the pain I've lost my quality of living I'm stuck in bed I can't do anything other than a normal person under 40 should be able to do. Does anybody have any suggestions on what type of doctor I could possibly navigate my way to? Any potential things I could Google that could help me find a way to Advocate to resolve the potential cause or suffering is rooted at?	undiagnosed
Just needed to vent	I'm sure this will just end up in the void, but I wanna get it off my chest. So I'm pretty sure that I have depression, anxiety, and OCD. Possibly PTSD, an eating disorder, and parinod personality disorder. But I don't know for sure, because I have never honestly talked to a professional about it. I try too, but I get so scared. I start thinking really intense, negative thoughts every time I try to talk about any of these things. I don't want to sound like I'm bragging or anything, like, that's a long list right? I suppose people can have all of those things and then some. But without any professional input at all, how can I possibly say I have all of those things? Also I'm pretty high functioning when I need to be. I know that I need to have my shit together at work so I try not to freak out all the time. Etc, ect, So yeah, that's basically why I don't feel comfortable talking honestly about it. P.s I'm glad I was able to wrap that up pretty nicely.	undiagnosed

HELP! Period issues: Extreme blood flow and huge clots over the past 2 weeks with a few days of nothing scattered throughou5	Asking for my gf (27f). She has no history of reproductive health issues (such as PCOS), but her mother, grandmather, and maternal aunt all had to have hysterectomies in their 50's. As we are both females there is no possibility of pregnancy or miscarriage. I won't get into personal details but trust me when I say there is no history nor possibility of any STI's. Health issues include mental illness, allergies, and scoliosis. Possible undiagnosed asthma and heart issues, but we're working with a doctor on that. She has been tested 3 times for anemia in the past and has been negative every time. The issue: she had 2 periods a few months ago where she had a few more clots then usual, also larger in size then usual, but still smaller then a quarter. In February she missed a period for the first time ever. On 03/25/2020 she began spotting and by Friday 03/27/2020 had dwindled to just a few drops every once in a while. On 03/30/2020 she got her period and it was progressing as normal. By 04/01/2019 her flow increased (which is normal) but the number of clots was even more then the last abnormal period and a little larger then a quarter. On 04/03/20 her flow increased to the point of bleeding through super tampons, soft disks, and even pads worn as an extra precaution every 1.5 - 2 hours and the clots have increased in number and size each time. This level of flow of clots continued into 04/04/20. On 04/05/20 her flow returned to normal (heavy, but not soaking through every hour heavy with minimal small clots). Yesterday (04/06/2020) we thought it was over as she only experienced the usual end of period light, no tampon necessary kind of spotting. After some non penetrative sexual activity around 12 AM this morning her flow amped up a little bit. By this afternoon she was bleeding through tampons and clothes with even bigger clots then before every hour and then every half hour. There is no sign of any slowing down yet. I might just be being paranoid but the first time the intense clotting and flow started was right after non penetrative sexual activity as well. I'm probably being stupid and it's unrelated but I thought I should mention it. This is so unusual for her and everything we've read so far says that clots larger then a quarter and or changes in volume of flow could mean a serious medical issue. We want to know if she needs to see a doctor right away or if we should just wait until her next appointment in 2 months to bring it up. Additional info: the only other symptoms she's experiencing are lower back pain and feeling 'out of it', both of which could be unrelated.	diagnoseme
