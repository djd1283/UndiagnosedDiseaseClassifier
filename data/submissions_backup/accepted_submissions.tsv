Any idea PCOS/Hashimotos/constant headaches ?	My wife (24) has been having symptoms that even through thorough lab tests, visits to specialists, has led to no outcome. Doctors say it may be hashimotos, May be pcos, etc. through the diagnosis, a doctor found a dermoid cyst, which was taken out. All along, she has had issues with headaches. A mild ab workout or standing in the kitchen for over 10mins causes her headaches. Ona. Scale of 1-10(hitting your head on a wall) she says it’s at a 7. The max that doctors have done, is a CT of the brain without contrast, when we pushed to see if there’s something wrong. 9 months after rigorous testing and running around to multiple doctors, we want to look into getting a full body & brain MRI to see if that could show anything. Sorry for the detailed info. But I want to know which type of mri should we opt for? I don’t mind paying out of pocket, since the doctors deny it due to lack of reasons for an MRI even though they fail to diagnose her condition. Any help would be deeply appreciated.	undiagnosed
Weird undiagnosed chronic pain that has been going on for over five years	Hi guys I need some input right now cause I am feeling really lost right. My body feels broken and I have never been diagnosed with anything. It all started when I 14 and I started have lower back pain for incorrect lifting techniques. The back pain is on my lower left side. Due to this pain I went to a physical therapist and he told me my left glute was not activating. During the course of pt I did glute strengthening excersises and core strengthing. The back pain lasted But I continued to play lacrosse for my school. My first year of high school lacrosse I got it and syndrome, and I pushed threw it. I rested for a while after that season and my pain decreased, but was still there when I excersised. I went back to pt for the itband syndrome but that did nothing. Then I got the bright idea to start lifting weights again and started feeling pain in my upper back. I went to pt for that and it helped slightly. I ended up fracturing my wrist around this time. I never let my wrist fully heal. To make a long story short I ended up to to pt 5 more times and none of it helped. Too make a long story short I still feel all this pain years later. I have tried injection and chiropractor care. That did not help. I’m 20 years old and lost I feel like I’m going insane and see no hope in sight. I was wondering if anyone has gone threw something similar and can help me out.	undiagnosed
Chest pains and dizziness for 17 years (T-3 to T-5 spine)	"I have been having this ongoing issue for 17 years now, and there doesn't seem to be any answer. I get these crazy feelings in my chest (I hesitate to call it pain because it a feeling that I don't know how to describe), and I'll get dizzy but not in the vertigo sense. If I take good care of myself, it happens less, but it still happens. When climbing steep hills/stairs I have to stop often (this has been happening from the age 18 to now 35). When the weather is over +35 C or under -35 C, I have trouble breathing and get similar symptoms. After looking into my heart and lungs, then didn't find anything, but noted I was not able to get my heart elevated to the rate they wanted for the stress test I took. After all the tests that I had, it has been discovered that I have degenerated discs between T-3 and T-5 (I have not been in any accident. I have also discovered that the left side of my body is larger than the right in some places like my arm, my calf, my ear, potentially my face, my stomach, and most importantly my left rib cage is larger than the right side (the left side being where I feel this pain). After going to a geneticist they theorize I may on a spectrum involved with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. I was also born with Wolf-Parkisans White but had a procedure to eliminate it. 6 years ago after a bad break-up I sought help for depression. Since then, my doctor refuses to believe that the problem is anything but panic attacks, but due to the fact that I don't behave or experience the panic attacks like a typical person he called them panic episodes and refuses to entertain anything other than putting me on anti-depressants. Last summer, I was taking a hike with a friend who is doing his residency to become a doctor, and I had to keep stopping every ten steps because of the pain in my chest. I told my friend that my doctor says that antidepressants would fix this climbing issue and my friend strongly disagreed. I should also note that if I have been drinking heavily the night before, these pains will be around all day the next day, making it impossible to do anything, other than crawl around on all four, or lay down or sit. Typically, a panic attack will last no more than an hour. For those days when I am hungover, or if I've done a lot of heavy lifting, these ""attacks"" go on all day and seem to be much more dependent on the position of my body, or physical exertion. My theory is because my rib cage is bigger on one side, it messed up my spine when I had a growth spurt at 18, and something neurological is going on between the T-3 to T-5. The only hope I found was a forum with other people with similar spine problems having similar symptoms. But they also don't know what do. Also once a massage therapist mentioned something about how that area of the spine is connected to the heart and lungs. I asked her if she knew what article/book she learned it from she said she didn't know. My doctor thinks its a ridiculous idea. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you."	undiagnosed
Soon-to-be 30 y/o female, debilitating symptoms and doing whatever I can to hold on to hope.	I failed to keep this short. I will gladly answer any questions that may be proposed due to missed information. this all started with some occasional pain in my right shoulder, no injury or known cause. 5 years later, my entire body is affected, and my right side is losing functionality, and I'm certain my left side will follow as has been the trend. I think they are muscle cramps, maybe spasms. it's a dull and throbbing sort of pain. feels like someone is spaghetti-twirling a fork into the tissue. the main areas affected are my shoulders and hips. Good days, the pain is only focused at one part of my body-usually the right shoulder-that first problem area. the pain is severe, but it's easier to apply a heating pad to one area for relief (which is minimal but absolutely welcomed). most of the time, my body seems to be lighting up, pain pulsing throughout every limb and throughout my trunk, even in my face. I have been having strange jerking/twitching episodes, like when you're about to fall asleep and jerk awake, but this happens throughout the day, standing, sitting, lying down. it used to be minimal, but it's progressed to a point that I'm embarrassed to go out in public because it draws a lot of attention. I must include that I am prone to seizures, and while it hasn't been ruled out as a type of seizure, I've had a normal EEG while the jerking was in the early stages of presenting itself, and occuring DURING the EEG. if that's important, which I believe it is. I've recently started taking high potency CBD oil, which has helped with the twitches and weakness but not the pain so far. I've always been in good shape, physically. petite yet strong, something I've been proud of my entire life. now whenever I use my muscles, with varying amounts of strength independent of days, I am unable to relax them after the action taken. mostly in my right arm, but the left has become progressively worse now. my hand freezes up into a claw-like position. I am mostly unable to grip things, and writing has become difficult. my hips lose strength spontaneously, and I've fallen many times because of it. there are days that I'm unable to walk. there are days that I can go for hours like there's nothing wrong, but I'll almost certainly be immobile following the activity. lately I'm finding it difficult to hold my head up or keep it still, like a bobble-head almost.. I'm not sure if it's noticeable because I'm now living with my mom, she hasn't said anything about it, and she hasn't held back questions about anything else. my mental health has deteriorated. I experience paranoid delusions, heavy anxiety, depression, laughing/crying spells, and what I can only describe as some kind of peripheral hallucination or mental glitch, that always causes fleeting fear. combatting my physical problems was difficult to begin with, but now my mental health has taken a hit, so I'm struggling much more these days, and I contemplate taking my own life daily because of the pain I experience. it has worn me down. I still have so much strength, which is evident in the fact that I am still here, but I am close to a breaking point. I've exhausted my story, and I have started another round of a diagnosis journey, but I don't feel like I have another one in me if this dead-ends. what I have going for me now is that my symptoms are so much worse than they were during previous rounds, and I have zero tolerance for dismissal of healthcare providers. an EMG/nerve conduction study have recently been recommended by a PA, and I'm finally coming up on a long-awaited neurology appointment to have the tests ordered, so that's where I am currently in the process. any suggestions, tips, ideas, and - most of all - words of encouragement will not go unappreciated. i wish anyone else who is currently struggling with an illness, diagnosed or not, the best of luck in their journey. thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read. best regards.

last night could have been my last night	i was feeling bad. worse than my normal bad. good days don't seem to come around anymore, it gets old, and i grasp to home remedies to temporarily comfort me. i drew a bath for myself and placed my tired body in the water. closest alternative to a full-body heating pad. then it happened. my back arched, my neck down to my hips, both arms and legs, turned rigid and immoveable. my face sunk below the surface and i could not make my brain communicate to the rest of my body to move for what felt like eternity. i sucked water into my nose and throat as I fought with any amount of regained strength i felt to wedge my body into position, bringing my head back above water. i eventually managed to pull myself on to the bathroom floor once the left side of my body woke back up and continued to choke for air between the spewing of water from my face. needless to say I am no longer allowed to take unsupervised baths, which pisses me off because it's just another aspect of my independence that has been taken away from me beyond any control of my own, and I'm not yet even 30. i allowed myself to be upset about this but only momentarily because now I have proof that I am not ready for death quite yet. i don't know when that day will come, and most days, it feels imminent, but I've still got some amount of will. if i didn't, i wouldn't be here to share this with whomever is listening. I saved myself. I know i didn't have to, but i did.	undiagnosed
Undiagnosed don’t know what happened	Please read this I am still suffering and I can’t take it anymore One day I was going to the gym as usual took a little extra preworkout and while in the gym my heart was really sore so I came back home. I took “half beta prograne”(the doctor had prescribed it for my anxiety it slowed heart rate down) . I took 2 thinking it would help, I lay down on my bed and after some time I felt my face swelling I’m not sure What it was but my face was bright red and my pupils dilated and I felt like a fish of blood going through my head and I got scared and jumped up my face was hot and I felt so hot I had to cool down so I jumped in the shower that kinda helped. I drank 6 liters of water and everything was weird. Every time I tried to lay down I felt a rush of blood. I put pillows to keep my head up. Next day I had sever e headache and my eyes were blurry and sensitive to light. My head was so hot and sore I took ice pack to cool it down it lasted for 3 days and I felt like I couldn’t concentrate I don’t know what happened. I had a feeling like I was looking through a camera my vision was weird. I took painkillers it didn’t help my extremely sore headache never had one like that before. Weeks later I would out of no where get that same blood rush feeling in my head and my pupils would get huge. I went to the doctor the doctor said it’s vertigo but I don’t think so she gave me tablets they didn’t do anything. This is getting to long but right now I can’t focus I don’t feel the same like before my eyes and vision just imagine your camera and you looking at your phone at things just like that and I get occasional headaches. I can’t think I can’t remember things I have brain fog and I feel like the world is going faster than I am!!!! I can’t describe the feeling. I feel out of my body	undiagnosed

I'm giving up	"To be honest, I still don't know fully how to talk about this because a lot of my memories of what happened are hazy. I'll start from the beginning though, just to give you guys a general idea of what's going on. So two years ago, I was completely healthy. I got migraines, sure, but for most of my childhood and the brief time I'd spent as an adult (I was 20) I never even ran a fever. I was living in Denver, CO working with at-risk kids as a full-time volunteer. It was intense and grueling and exhausting work (60 hour high-stress work weeks mixed with having no money and living in a big city for the first time with an insane roommate) but it was also extremely rewarding. For the first half of the school year, everything was going great. Until around December, when I got bronchitis that just...wouldn't go away. When I went home for Christmas break, it had essentially progressed to pneumonia. The second half of the year, things got progressively worse. I lost my appetite completely, couldn't breathe well enough to walk longer than 10 minutes, couldn't climb the stairs. Eventually, I was so sick that I'd throw up anything I DID eat. My body was just constantly in pain. Everything hurt and nothing was getting better. I lost over a hundred pounds and was beginning to lose my hair. I managed to finish the program out and see my kids until their last day of school, but as soon as I stopped having to put on the uniform and go to school every day, I absolutely CRASHED. Everything that was already bad got even worse. My family ended up driving out to Denver (a 13 hour drive) and renting a hotel room. They put me in it and cleaned my apartment out for me. Then, they drove me home and instead of taking me back home with them, they brought me straight to the ER. My doctor told me then that I was extremely lucky I went in when I did. If I had waited until Monday when my doctors appointment was scheduled, then I likely wouldn't have made it. I was diagnosed with malnutrition, dehydration, pericardial effusion, heart failure, kidney failure, and, of course, organizing pneumonia. They tested me for everything under the sun. I saw just about every specialist in the hospital as they ruled out... Everything. I was tested from everything from rocky mountain fever to lupus to leukemia, and the tests came back consistently negative. They tested the fluid from around my heart, the bone marrow from my spine, my saliva, and probably a billion blood tests. While hospitalized, I ended up getting 9 blood transfusions because my hemoglobin kept dipping so low. My WBC was consistently going up while my RBC was consistently going down. My feet and legs were swollen like footballs. My CRP level was over 400 and I was on such a high level of oxygen that I couldn't leave my bed. I ended up transferring to Barnes Jewish because the hospital I was at just didn't have the resources to figure it out. Cue me getting tested for everything, again, plus the doctors being convinced that the only answer could be anorexia. (Lmao trust me, I'm the farthest thing from anorexic. I love food normally, this lack of appetite was a symptom, not the cause) They ended up almost releasing me just because they had run out of possible diagnosises when, finally, a miracle happened. Sort of. At this point, I've been in the hospital for 2 months. I'm no longer to the point of being near death, but I am still sick. My muscles have all atrophied, so walking is extremely painful. Of course they make me do it anyways, because that's how you get better. But I notice that while one leg is getting better, the other one is extremely painful. Turns out the ultrasound they'd done of my right leg before was inconclusive because I kept flinching away from the thingie. So they do an MRI. And what do they find? Vasculitis. Of course, they only find it in my leg. But I had similar symptoms in my left arm not that long before. The problem with that is having vasculitis on opposite extremities but NOWHERE else is extremely rare. I think I recall a doctor asking me if I'd ever done cocaine because there's a few rare cases in some other country where one particular strain of cocaine causes similar vasculitis symptoms. It was bizarre. But it was enough. They wanted to biopsy my leg, but my blood was too thin even after being pumped full of vitamin K and 2 plasma transfusions. So instead, they treated it the same way all autoimmune diseases can be treated. They gave me steroids. I improved almost immediately, to where I was sitting up in bed, coloring, laughing, and just generally felt...better. It wasn't a diagnosis, but it was SOMETHING and after 2 months of being tested for everything under the sun, it was a good feeling. They released me, I started seeing a rheumatologist, and things got better. I was on 80 mg of prednisone and was slowly tapering it with an increasing dose of Imuran, an immunosuppressant. Cut to a year later and my health is getting weird again. I'm getting recurring kidney stones and I've done the stupidest thing possible. I've stopped taking my medicine. I land myself in the hospital again, though it gets caught a lot faster this time. Because I've moved to a new state, I've been proactive in finding a rheumatologist, and he's taking my health very seriously. After some lab results come back with high inflammation markers, and I've lost my appetite again, he sends me to the ER. Again, a million tests are done. 2.5 weeks later, I'm released with no more answers than before. After an angiogram, it's revealed that my thyroid and ureters are inflamed. My doctor has a theory that I have IGG4 Related Disease. So I get both my ureter and my thyroid biposied. And... Nope. Of course, there's evidence of chronic inflammation. There's evidence of that in all my organs. But I've tested negative for IGG4 Related Disease. Again, there are no answers. Currently, I'm back on prednisone and Imuran. We""re tapering the prednisone slowly, but it doesnt look like Imuran is going to be enough to do the trick, so he's going to switch me to rituxin infusions. I think I may have to give up on a diagnosis and just hope the treatment works."	undiagnosed
Carb Coma ?	My daughter is 13 for most of her life she has chronic abdominal illness she had a hard time tolerating food as an infant she was born prematurely , she projectile vomited , her hands and feet would turn blue as a baby. She had Gerd,reflux , esophagitis she was very fussy with foods as she continue to grow she continued to have the reflux problems she started getting chronic headaches and total body tightness what we began to notice is if we fed her foods specifically it started with Cheerios and pancakes from IHOP she would go into a drunken stupor for about 30 minutes she would then follow sleep from anywhere from 4 to 6 hours and then wake up with chronic and total body painIt is not abdominal pain we would see slight swelling at her lips and eyes when she would wake up her entire body hurt she says that her skin feels tight this used to happen once every few months then became once a month and has quickly escalated into weekly and almost daily after she wakes up there is a slow burn of her feeling just not right We have seen two top children’s hospitals in our area when they cannot get her to fit into a particular box they then tell us her issues maybe psychological that her body gets used to eating these foods and then makes the reaction happen I have a hard time agreeing with that because I have seen it happen so many times and the types of food that it happens with primarily was junkie carbohydrates and has now moved into other types of foods like dairy and nuts. . We are completely lost she is missing school she is being seen by medical professionals but we can’t get anywhere she has had every possible food allergy test they have suggested she has had gastric emptying and she has had endoscope she has had so many tests and they still tell us it’s psychological and I understand that there is things like conversion disorders but the scope and the frequency happens more and more she has seen psychologists and they give her coping strategies she’s been doing this since she is four years old she’s not a stressed child Her greatest life stress is that she eats food and passes out into this coma like state does anybody have any ideas or suggestions we are desperate to take this to the Internet	undiagnosed

The Foot Bone's connected to the Uterus Bone, I guess?	Now that I have your attention, allow me to share the genuinely bizarre foot pain that 7 specialists can't figure out. 8 days after having a neurectomy (for ACNES) I stood up and had a sharp, extreme pain in my large toe, right at the joint where it meets the foot. It felt like I'd broken it (I've sprained various parts of me well enough to know what that was like). When I went to get X-rays, they found that I was perfect, so I saw my GP. He noted the localized heat, swelling and redness, and told me I had gout. Which is an interesting diagnosis, because I was a 23 year old woman who doesn't consume alcohol at all. (For those of you that don't know: gout is virtually unheard of in women below menopausal age, other than in extreme alcohol addicts) After going back to a stand-in GP one day trying to get pain meds (that never helped anyway), she balked at the gout diagnosis, and sent me to the rheumatologist. The rheumatologist sent me to the orthopedic surgeon, who sent me to the OB/GYN. The clincher, and the real reason nobody can figure out why my foot hurts so much, is that it only hurts for about 3 days, *when I start my period*. After that the pain fades rapidly and after 7 days I'm better. When the pain is bad, my foot throbs, and I have to walk on the outside of my foot. *It doesn't show up outside of my menstrual cycle and I don't have menstrual cycles without the pain in my toe.* It's not a huge bother - like I can still do my daily errands - but it's just weird. I never have pain in between attacks and they always settle down by themselves. Painkillers don't make a dent. They've done x-rays, ultrasounds, bloodwork and an MRI and found some inflammation around my sesamoides, but that's really about it. Other than congenital asthma, I'm a hugely healthy individual. They've ruled out gout, arthiritis, rheumatism, damage to the bone and are now searching for endometriosis. In... in my toe. They're trying to find uterine tissue in my toe. I'm not saying it couldn't be there, but I am saying, you would expect to see that kind of thing on an ultrasound or MRI scan. Soooo... anybody got any cute ideas about what kind of demonic gremlin is wreaking havoc in my toe, and why it is collaborating with the one that's rented out a room in my uterus?	undiagnosed
Seeking Help with an Undiagnosed Illness (foreign objects that look like worms in throat, nose, etc.)	Hello, I'm looking for any sort of help or information that might lead to a diagnosis and cure for these symptoms I've been experiencing for over ten years. It started with a lump around 2006/2007 underneath my ear, then I started to get sick a lot. It was flu like symptoms and sever headaches, body aches, and dizziness. My equilibrium was so bad I felt like I'd fall over even when sitting down and it got so bad I'd be at work and feel like I'd pass out while sitting there (a feeling of being lightheaded but you're sitting down). Every time they did a needle biopsy where the knot was I'd break out with these big pustule cyst type bumps and I felt like something was crawling underneath my skin on the left side. They've done several needle biopsies since this began and eventually they took out my tonsils because they were getting swollen, bleeding, and full of puss. They took out my wisdom teeth because they said that could cause an infection in trying to pinpoint where this might be, but as a result my lymph nodes swelled up underneath the knot. After that they cut out 2 of my lymph nodes to do a biopsy and the results didn't show anything, and after more of them swelled back up. I've been wishing to see a infectious diseases doctor, but none of my primary care physicians have been willing to refer me. Just recently I lost my insurance, so now I really don't know what my options are. I've been doing research and watching documentaries about parasites and I've found that I have a lot of the same symptoms described by the people in these documentaries. I found an episode of Monsters Inside Me that describes the dirofilaria worm and this seems pretty close to my experience with whatever is going with me. However I'm not positive, I've found a few other illnesses that seem like they could fit such as Angiostongyliasis and toxoplasmosis, but I can't be sure. It feels like there's something moving around mostly in my eye and temple area and I've seen movement and an object that looks like a worm in my eye. Then objects that also look worm-like or like larvae have come out of my nose and throat and it feels like there's something rooting around in my sinuses at times, like something digging. This whole thing affects my speech at times to the point where I feel like I've had slurred speech. I'll be talking to people and it just comes out wrong. It's affecting my cognitive functions. When I'm talking to people it feels like I can't communicate properly and like everything just comes out wrong. Because I don't have insurance I've had to try alternate methods and medications. In my research I came across Dr Sebi's Cell Food (the Advanced Package), it comes with a product called Lymphalin and I've been using it because it's supposed to help with the lymph nodes swelling. Using the package has been offering some relief from the pain, but it's still there and still pretty active throughout the day. Please any help or advice is welcome. I just really want to understand what is going on inside of me and what steps I can take to move forward and find a cure. {These are pics of the object in my eye as well as some of the stuff that has come out of my nose/throat, might want to magnify so you can see it better.

help me please	So, this is about something that started about 4-5 years ago. I started puking one day, it went away for a while at first. The doctors thought it was stomach acid but the medicine they gave me, didn't help. Eventually I started puking a couple times week, which then grew into puking like 20-30 times a day, literally. I have had countless hospitals and doctors visits and countless tests done. Nobody can seem to figure out why I puke so much but it effects me going to school and out in public. They gave me a pill to help calm the vomiting, that didn't work. They gave me a stronger one which works, but only for a certain time and I start puking again. Sometimes the pill doesn't work at all and I continue puking all day and night. It doesn't matter how much or how little I eat. It also doesn't matter what I eat. I wish it could just disappear and leave me alone but wishes don't work..I just want to be normal😭	undiagnosed
Please! Help is wlcome from anyone willing	My name is Sarah, I am 20 years old and for the past 6-8 momths I have been experiencing unbelievable abdominal pains. I have described these pains to multiple doctors and specialists. They are crippling, bring-me-to-my-knees types of pains, I become short of breath, start sweating profusely, and often cry from the pain (I am not an easy crier, I have a very high pain tolerance). In words I would describe it as someone using a pitchfork to spaghetti noodle my insides. It starts just below my belly button, spreads to my hips, then wrap around and come up my back and lasts anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour and a half, usually without any warning. After a CT scan, manual pelvic exam, internal pelvic ultrasoubd, multiple urine tests, a blood test, meeting with a uroligist and more, ALL of my tests have come back normal, with the exception of blood in my urine. I do have kidney stones and ovarian cysts, but have been told that neither of those is the cause of my pain. I am 5’4” and 160lbs at my heaviest — I have tried food journaling, changinging my diet, and losing weight. I am scheduled to meet with a GI specialist in 3 days, but I doubt that will give me any answers either. Please, though my boyfriend and family have been incredibly supportive, I am absolutely sick of dealing with this. I need answers, of any kind. I need you fellow redditors.

Loved one has had undiagnosed very low ferritin levels for months with weakness and other symptoms	I've already posted much of what's below in another, non-reddit, forum, but they informed me that they weren't qualified to answer questions involving medical diagnoses, so I'm re-posting it here. \-------- I'm typing this on behalf of my mother. She has been feeling sick and weak for at least months and has gone to several doctors with no diagnosis. The problem is that the doctors don't communicate or share medical records, or, they are myopic and can't make diagnoses that fall outside their specialty. To get to the point, my mom's ferritin level has dropped from 9 to 7 in a month ( It's supposed to be in the 16 to 288 range for healthy individuals ). My mom's rheumatologist was concerned and sent her to hematologist who \*did nothing\*. He instead recommended that she should have a colonoscopy, but none of her other blood work or tests indicated that she had any type of gastrointestinal bleeding and she doesn't have dark stools . Since my mom saw her rheumatologist, my mom's ferritin dropped 2 more points. The sections of the blood work that are pertinent include the following : `Other blood results:` `IRON AND TOTAL IRON BINDING CAPACITY IRON, TOTAL Reference Range: 45-160 mcg/dL 67 - No Historical Data` `IRON BINDING CAPACITY Reference Range: 250-450 mcg/dL (calc) 468 H` `% SATURATION Reference Range: 16-45 % (calc) 14 L No Historical Data` `MCH 25.3 L Reference Range: 27.0-33.0 pg` `MCHC 30.6 L Reference Range: 32.0-36.0 g/dL` `RDW 16.4 H Reference Range: 11.0-15.0 %` We live in Spring Texas in the United States and my mom is using the government health care plan, which is horrible ( at least it is now, but it's all she can afford ). She's seen about a dozen or more doctors and none of them can seem to figure out what the problem is. We don't know quite what to do at this point. Anyway, I hope this is the correct forum for my question. If anyone has any recommendations, we'd be very grateful. Thank you, jdbtwo	undiagnosed
My Story	"My name is Brooke Journeaux. I am a 26 year old mother of two. I'll begin my story before I realized anything was wrong. I don't remember the exact date, but sometime in early 2017, I was walking through my kitchen when I experienced sharp, unbearable pain in both of my ears. My fiancé was able to direct me to the bed to sit down when I started to experience tingling sensations that went up both of my arms. And then it was like my brain shut off. I did not want to be touched. I curled up in fetal position and began to hysterically cry and hyperventilate. I don't really remember how long it lasted, an hour maybe, but when I woke up the next day I felt like I had a hangover. I had severe brain fog. We decided it best to go to the ER, where I was told I had a panic attack. I've had them before, but this was the worst one up to that point. Fast forward to late 2017. My girls and I had moved in with my parents down in Tennessee, while I worked at a bank as a single mother, getting our lives back together. It was stressful, but I was making it. In early 2018 I began to start having these strange sensations like I was always on the verge of having a panic attack. I would get hot flashes and cold chills and my brain would just feel foggy. I remember one day, while dealing with a customer, my computer screen just whirlpooled, for lack of a better word. I just brushed it off as nothing serious. Then there was the day I did have a panic attack at work and had to go sit in the break room while it passed. I was confused, because other than these recent weird feelings, I was the happiest I had been in a long time, so there should have been nothing causing me to have panic attacks. Then it got to the point where if I was stuck in traffic on the way home I would get dizzy and feel like I was going to pass out. I just figured I wasn't eating enough, even though I snacked between meals all day long. My fiancé moved back in with us April 2018 and the sensations would come and go, but I mostly felt fine and never felt the need to see a doctor about it. June of 2018 I noticed that I had lost most of the feeling in my right big toe. I thought it was weird, but it wasn't affecting me in any debilitating way, so I never got it looked at. July of 2018, I was involved in a hit run, in which the other person got away. I then had to spend the remainder of my savings account on buying a new car. A few weeks later I started to have battery issues with my new car, right before we had planned to take a week long vacation to go visit my family in South Carolina. I had to instead spend that money on getting my car fixed, so that was extremely stressful, as I hadn't seen my family there for several years. August 9, 2018. I went to my car on my lunch break. The last thing I ate were my blueberries and one of them had this awful chemical taste to it. I spit it out. I noticed that whenever I went back inside to work, the inside of my mouth had went numb on the left side. And the left side of my face began to feel weak. I went to answer the drive thru, which had feedback at times, that normally wouldn't bother me. This time it was extremely painful. I had hypersensitivity in my left ear and eye. I decided it best to go get checked out at an Urgent Care facility close to my home. He had me do a few things and concluded that my left side was weaker than my right and sent me to the ER. On the way there I began to get weird tingling sensations throughout my head. When I got there, they did an MRI, which came back inconclusive. I noticed that the pattern on my hospital gown made me dizzy. When I told them that, they blew it off and said they didn't know why that would be happening. I got sent home after they told me I had some sort of combination of Bell's Palsy and Trigeminal Neuralgia. They referred me for a follow up with a neurologist. I woke up the next day feeling completely fine. It wasn't until that evening that I had more issues. I was watching a movie with my girls. As soon as the movie went off and I went to move my head, everything went extremely blurry. I got extremely dizzy and my arms immediately started to tingle and go numb. I called my fiancé, who was at work at the time, completely freaking out and had him come home. It wasn't going away so we called an ambulance. They did a heart test, I forget what it's called. But it came back fine and they told me that it was the same thing I was dealing with the previous day and to schedule an appointment with a neurologist. The next few months were so crazy, that I'm not sure if this next part will be in chronological order. My memory is, and always has been awful. I talked to my supervisor about what was going on and went ahead and took my vacation hoping that by the time that week was up, I would be able to return to work. Well I wasn't. I was having almost constant dizziness as well as a lot of vertigo. I would get sharp pains and pressure behind my eyes and ears. Sometimes it would last only a few minutes, and others it would last for hours. A lot of the time I would have to just lay on the couch because I couldn't handle the amount of effort it took my brain to walk around. This eventually led to me being unable to drive or work. I saw a neurologist and he suspected Vestibular Migraines and put me on a week long round of steroids. This only made my symptoms more intense. Shortly after that I began to start having some of my weirder symptoms. Often it felt like I was trying to walk through water, as it seemed harder to move my legs. Sometimes they would just give out on me. I only fell all the way down once, and that was more due to vertigo. Here, I will list some of my symptoms: -vertigo, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, pain/pressure behind ears/eyes, numbness/tingling in random places, electric wave feelings going through my brain, confusion, trouble speaking when confused, a complete lack of thoughts at all, stabbing pains in random parts of my body, chest tightness, sore scalp, tinnitus, phantom noises, nystagmus, feeling of my brain being on fire, body swaying, heavy head, migraine, reduced hearing, leg stiffness, leg weakness, feeling of chest on fire, hot flashes, cold chills, heat made my dizziness and vertigo worse, while cold made my pain worse. These are just what I could think of off the top of my head. I can tell you that we tried a few different medications. The first one I tried was Amitriptyline, which didn't do anything but help me sleep, but I continued to take it for that reason. I didn't notice anything was wrong, but my fiancé noticed a change in my mood, where I was more irritable and more depressed. I had been taking it a little over a month, when I attempted suicide with my Amitriptyline. This was a rare side effect of this medication that almost killed me. I never in my right mind would do that to my family, regardless of what is going on with myself. So I discontinued the Amitriptyline and tried Nortriptyline, recommended by my ENT. I stopped taking it after the second day, as it made me absolutely miserable. It was as if my symptoms were magnified 10x. After that, I was done with medication for awhile and instead tried Vestibular Rehab. She found clonus of my lower extremities and her opinion was that this is more than just a vestibular issue. This rehab seemed to help more than anything else I had tried and she recommended I start doing yoga. So I looked up some YouTube videos and made it a daily routine to do yoga. I also began to eat mostly unprocessed foods and am taking 250mg of Magnesium daily. I slowly became less stressed, and my symptoms slowed down enough to where I could get a part time job in January 2019. I got some light sensitivity glasses and went to work. After awhile, I began to feel great, enough so that I got the Front Desk Manager position at my job. Every now and then, if I didn't eat right or I got too stressed, I would get dizzy and confused but it wasn't ever really bad. There was only one day that I had to leave work early. So for months I went with hardly any symptoms. I did a second round of Vestibular Rehab when they did start to pop back up. Before I left my original neurologists office, he was able to refer me to Vanderbilt for a second opinion, MRI, and balance test. My MRI was ""essentially unremarkable."" I have questions about my MRI, because I saw some things that didn't look right to me, but I'm not a radiologist so I'll get a second opinion on that. My balance test showed my left ear was 27% weaker than my right. They talked about the possibility of Meneire's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, or mini strokes. But it was then concluded that I was ""too young"" for it to be any of these things. I've had just about every blood test you can think of, which have all come back normal. Before I made the trip to Vanderbilt, I would like to note that a lot of the doctor's I was seeing for my issues tried to tell me it was a physical manifestation of my childhood trauma. I know my body. And this is not all in my head and I was enraged, as was my fiancé, when they tried to tell me that's what it was. We recently have moved back to KY, under not the greatest of circumstances. It's been stressful, to say the least. I've been here about a week now and only a few days after arriving, I have begun to have symptoms again, each day getting a little bit worse. It started with just some slight dizziness, then vertigo and nystagmus. My legs have been giving out. Last night the Bell's Palsy thing happened again on my left side, except for this time, the top of my left arm and leg are both numb. I had issues pulling my thoughts together and speaking, which seems to have resolved for the most part today, but I am still getting dizziness, vertigo, and hot flashes/cold chills. My vision in my left eye is now worse than that of my right eye, which has a prescription. Before I conclude this, I will throw out there that my father has been experiencing similar symptoms for years now and he has yet to get a diagnosis because of his lack of insurance and money. My aunt has Multiple Sclerosis and wants me to look into that possibility. I do not want to be one of those cases that takes 17 years to diagnose, when it's to the point of no return. I have two young children I am wanting to homeschool, but if I ""relapse"", for lack of a better word, it won't be an option. I have probably left bits and pieces out, but it has been a long journey and an abundance of chaos."	undiagnosed
PLEASE HELP ME!! UNDIAGNOSED PAIN CONTINUING TO GO OVERLOOKED!!	I first experienced this pain when I was 16 years old. I was at the time on my period and I brushed it off as terrible cramps. It felt like the worst cramping/stabbing/sharp pain I've ever felt in my life, it was so severe it brought me to my knees and took my breath away. I didnt feel that pain for a couple years and once I was 18, the same pain started coming back. This time it didn't come with my periods. It would hit me as random episodes with absolutely no warning or correlation to anything. It seemed like it happened anywhere from between 8 to 6 months. It was always the same pain, it was so bad it would keep me from doing anything. I have gone to the ER for this 3 or 4 times now and its cost so much money and time. I've had countless doctor's appointments and each time, they come up with nothing. A couple doctors have questioned if it was in my head or not, thinking I might have depression or anxiety that manifested into physical pain. I've never been diagnosed with either and I personally do not think it's a mental problem. Usually these episodes last up to 12-20 hours and then go away. The one I have now, which started Sunday night at 12 am, is still here and its rendered me completely useless. I was asleep and early in the morning I was woken up with how intense the pain got. I could barely get out of bed or stand up straight, I got my mom and she said I was totally gray. My ears started ringing to the point I couldn't hear and I was super nauseous. I went to the ER shortly after I woke up, which was monday, and it was the worst pain I think I've ever experienced. For those of you who know what it's like to have an IUD placed, it feels like the first initial cramp that absolutely shocks you, but goes away after a few seconds. It's that pain, but continuous for over 24 hours now. It hurts so incredibly bad for so long now, I dont know what to do. I can't live like this and I need help. All my bloodwork, ultrasounds, CAT scans, HIDA scans, everything looks normal. The only thing is that for a few months now, my white blood cell count and glucose level has been elevated. Every doctor says I seem totally healthy and they can't find a reason for the pain. The pain initially starts in my stomach, above my belly button and then my uterus starts hurting. At first it's always bareable and then the debilitating pain just hits me. The worst of the pain is centered around my uterus, ovaries, and even my private areas. I can't sit down, I can't spread out, no laying on my stomach to see if it helps. There's nothing to do that takes the pain away even a little bit. Ibuprofen doesnt seem to help, unless it's the extra strong dosage from hospitals. It hurts my bladder/uterus area so incredibly bad when I pee or put any sort of pressure on it. It's never lasted this long and it really is ruining my life. I dont know if I can keep living like this, just waiting for the next episode of severe, sickening pain. I need help from anyone who might know what I'm talking about, or I'm just going to keep wasting money on ER trips that only dull the pain momentarily, followed up by more and more doctor's visits - if I can even last that long before I see if I can just take out my uterus and ovaries. Thank you for reading if you made it this far. I need help.	undiagnosed
Never ending stomache pain	Im posting about my girlfriend of 6 years. Sense she was about 12 shes had episodes of extreme abdominal pain she discribes it as a stabbing pain thats right in the center of her body about where the rib cage ends. Its not a constant pain but when she gets her bouts they can last anywhere from a cple days to weeks to months. When its bad she cant even move or walk ive never in my life seen anyone in such a state. She is now 32 and the doctors and hospitals never have any answers shes seen numerous specialists been on a slew of diff medications and nothing seems to help they removed her gaul bladder maybe 6mnths ago and hasnt had an episode intill just this last friday. Our local er keeps her for a few hours then sends her in in the same state she came saying theres notjing they can do for her all the while shes hasnt even beem able to keep water down and has been in bed in constant pain crying and moaning. I hate to see her in this state and shes at her wits end dealing with it. Thamkyou for everyone who has taken the time to read and i appreciate all input	undiagnosed
I've been in hell with no escape.	I'm just in constant pain. The entire time. Iron rods shooting through my shins, stepping on sharp rocks, needles being pushed into my shoulder joint, the bones in my calf deep freezing in an instant. Not always all at once. Often one at a time. And there are periods when I have none... That almost makes it worse. Makes me realize how bad it has slowly become. How much I've been fighting to maintain a normal life. A life where I go to class, and out with friends. A life where I don't wince every 5 minutes, or control my breathing to stop tears forming in my eyes. I'm tired all the time. I just want a nap. Just 5 years should do it. The meds my doctor's gave me all stop working over time, and I don't know if it's because the pains are getting worse, or my body's getting used to the drugs, or a combination of both. But I do know that the drugs they're trying me on are several categories above where I started a year ago. My GP hasn't a clue what's causing it, or who to refer me to. The rhumatologist was the same. I'm not sure I'll survive another 7 months on a waiting list. Not with all of me intact. Even typing this I have pains in my thumb, my ankle, my collarbone, through my lungs, and my hands are twitching randomly. It makes it hard, when I'm going through all this, while still dealing with the ongoing grief from my brothers cancer journey, and his death. And so desperately wishing it's not cancer. And I feel like I can't say anything, because despite the length I have no label. I can't say I have... Anything. Because we have no idea. We're not even sure it's a nerve disorder. It may be psychological. And I feel like crap even mentioning it, because it's nothing compared to what my little brother went through with his chemo, and coming to terms with his mortality and death. So I suck it up, and bury it deep, but I'm scared. Terrified. What if life's like this now? What if there's never an answer? What if the damage is already done? If you've made it this far, I'm sorry it's so long. Just had a lot of very confusing things to get out.	undiagnosed
I can’t write certain letters and numbers	I have this problem where I cannot write certain letters. It is kind of hard to explain, but I am going to do my best. I didn’t notice it until a few years ago. I went to write the letter “S” and my mind just froze. My pen was to the paper, getting ready to write my name, and I just couldn’t make my hand move. I kept starting over and over to write the “S” and I finally got it, but it was messy looking. Growing up I do not recall having any problems with writing letters. I have always done well in my English classes, and I love to read, and journaling used to be a big thing for me. I have never been diagnosed with a learning disorder either. I don’t think it’s a learning disorder, and I’ll explain why. If I am not looking down at the paper, or if I close my eyes, I can write the letters that I have trouble with while writing a word. The letters(and numbers) that give me the most trouble are: S, O, P, Q, D, C, G, J, O, Q, S, and U. Sometimes the letters V, J, and W. With the “W” I have noticed I have problems when I try to use curved lines instead of straight ones to make the W. The numbers are: 2, 3, 8, 9, 0. When I look at the numbers and letters I have a hard time writing, they all seem to be curved in one way or another. Making letters out of straight lines are fine. I will be writing a sentence, or a word, and when I come to a difficult letter my hand stops, and I have to force my hand to make the movement to finish the letter/number. This is while writing words, and sentences, etc. If I am making the letters by themselves I don’t typically have a problem. I feel my hand tense up whenever I start to write, and I sometimes get cramps from holding my pen too tight while trying to write. I can write a letter or number in the air, mimicking the way it would be written on paper, but when it comes time to it, I struggle. I also have no problems typing or reading. Here’s a little about me: I do struggle with dysthymia, general anxiety disorder, and PTSD. I am on antidepressants (I noticed this problem before the antidepressants). I get told a lot that I am tense, and I just recently had to go to the dentist because of a toothache, but nothing was wrong with my tooth, I was just clenching my jaw too tight, and putting a lot of pressure on my teeth. I clench my jaw when I am stressed, and I am constantly stressed. I do have a lot going on in my life, but even when things seem somewhat calm, I am stressed about something. I get told a lot I’m going to worry myself to death, which at this point I believe because I also suffer from GERD, and digestive health has been linked with stress. I do smoke weed, and socially drink (maybe a couple of times a month). I do smoke regularly. I didn’t start smoking until I was 21 (I’m 23 now) and I didn’t start drinking until I was 21 as well. I noticed this problem before I started smoking. I have found a couple of ways of going around these problems. For example for the letter 3, I have found it not a problem to start the number if I put a straight line at the top, and then finish the rest. I just started a new job where writing is a huge part of it, and I am becoming more and more frustrated with myself over this, and I don’t know what it means, or what to do about it. I do not have health insurance, so no I have not seen a doctor/neurologist about this. I am looking desperately for answers, and I keep coming up short. So if anyone knows anything about this, or experiences this, please share your knowledge. I cry about this frequently, and just want to fix it.	undiagnosed
What Is Wrong With My Foot?	So my right foot, just inbetween the ankel and the bottom of my foot, will hurt severely. To the point i have to limp around, cant bend it, or put weight on it. It'll even be sore to the touch right below my ankel. This happens if i wear high heels, use it to much ( walk long distances). Or sometimes it just happens randomly. Nothing i do ever relives the pain. No ibprufien. Not a hot bath. Not staying off of it or elavating it. Ive had xrays done but they show nothing. Bloodwork shows slightly high inflammation but nothing alarming. Ive been to my GP and a rumutolgist ( or however you spell it) and they have no answers for me. Does anybody have any idea what could be wrong? This has been going on since i was 15 and im 24 now.	undiagnosed
Not being taken seriously	I’ve talked about this in another subreddit but here we go. For over a year I’ve had lots of swollen lymph nodes and horrible constant lung pain. I went to the doctor multiple times but I just gave up after a while because I was told that I just had a cold and that it would go away. It did not. Around five months ago I started to get really bad joint and muscle pain all over. I went to the doctor a few times and got x-rays on my legs and lots of blood tests but everything came out fine. Soon after that, I developed chronic stomachaches and headaches that do not go away. I went to the doctor again but nothing came of it. After that I started to experience trouble balancing and tremors in my hands. I went to the doctor AGAIN today but she just told me she didn’t know what was happening and sent me home. Everything is extremely painful and it stops me from being able to hang out with people and doing things that I love. No one will listen to me or take me seriously and I just want to know what is happening so I can make it stop. (Sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes I’m exhausted so I can’t focus well)	undiagnosed
i’m so frustrated	for almost exactly a year i’ve been experiencing frequent vomiting, frequent dizziness, constant fatigue, nausea, and headaches, and i’m so weak that sometimes i can’t walk or even sit up. i’ve been to many doctors and specialists, had a gastric emptying study done, an upper endoscopy, xrays, mris, ct scans, everything. and we can’t figure out what is going on with me. i’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life and i can tell it’s not anxiety. i recently turned 20, i used to travel to different countries, i had lots of friends and was always doing something fun and exciting. now i can barely leave my home unless it’s to go to work. i’m so young and it’s so frustrating that these are supposed to be the best years of my life and i’m stuck here, quite literally suffering. i’m not asking any questions or looking for advice, just looking to vent to people who may understand.	undiagnosed
Depresssion or something else ?	Hi everyone, Recently (the last 4-5 months) I have been feeling quite down. And iv had so many symptoms. Before this I thought I knew my body, but it turns out I’m beginning to completely not understand myself. Il just get straight to it and try to create a cohesive pattern of events and maybe someone would have ideas or know what’s going on with me. So I had a really stressful time in my life (I think), at a work placement, I was doing work from 9-5 then doing more work at home after, trying to secure a job. However I didn’t quite click with the people and I felt they didn’t like me much, eventually we kept arguing and they would go out of their way to make things difficult for me. So I left. Now I usually have a lay back attitude yes these people annoyed me, yes it wasn’t a good part of my life, but I learned a lot and just chalked it up to them being not very nice people and that’s that. I didn’t feel stressed, during it. I got over it fast. Then I started to do small bits of work from home for myself and learn more. Things were great ! I was actually glad I left, I kept up with my new routine. But then one day I just felt a wave of depression come over me, but I wasn’t feeling sad or angry but I couldn’t shake the feeling. I did more exercise eat healthier all to try to lift the mood change I noticed. Well this kept going for on for a couple month and I was getting fed up. Then my symptoms took a nose dive. I began to feel extreme fatigue, joint pain I mean I was so tired that I felt I never slept at all, then for about 2 weeks into the third month I kept getting insomnia (which has now gone). I’ve been getting spots on my face which were never there before. So I went to the doctors for a blood test, it came back that I was low in Phosphate and my vitamin D levels were borderline, and they put me on Phosphate Sandoz 500mg Phosphorus. I took that for about a week and I felt a bit better. However overtime the symptoms came back again. Decided to have another blood test and my phosphate was LOWER than before, so he gave me TONS of the stuff. But this time it didn’t help. So I went back desperate to fix the fatigue. Because it had for awhile now interfered with my life, I can’t even remember what feeling energised feels like. So iv stopped taking the phosphate as it’s not helped but every day I take 2000 UI of Vitamin D. (Because vitamin D is harmless, I think) but nothing seems to change. I wake up in the morning feeling exhausted, my back and shoulders feel tense and stiff, and it’s the worst in the morning. Eventually through out the day it kind of simmers down, but then I’m left with a constant anxious feeling. But I have NOTHING to feel anxious about ! it’s just there ! My doctor chalked it up to Fibromyalgia (which I don’t believe) but also that it could be depression (which I’m starting to convince myself it is) but the thing is I don’t feel sad, I feel miserable because of how I feel everyday, not the other way around. Yes my life was rough for a bit but iv been through far worse, but im very fortunate and I have great supportive family and friends. However what iv also noticed accompany my fatigue is constant gut discomfort, and I struggle to go to the toilet very often. The doctor also noticed I had a nasal polyp. Which brings me to the other part of my puzzle, could vaping cause this nasal congestion and be ruining my life ? iv vaped for years and had no problem prior and I only vape 100% VG and nicotine on a low dose, no flavouring. I’m also hoping it isn’t vaping as I will struggle to quit it. I don’t want to go back to actual smoking. I just have so much wrong with me, which makes me down. I’m so confused. Does any of this hit a note with anyone ? or am I just depressed, without knowing it ? If anyone wants any more info ask questions I would be so thankful ! Any bit of knowledge in any of these areas could potentially improve my quality of life :)	undiagnosed
Dealing with being undiagnosed	I know so many of us have different issues, but I was wondering how you deal with being undiagnosed. Personally, I often feel unheard and like I’m making a big deal out of nothing, even when I’ve had it confirmed by doctors that there is a problem, we just don’t know what it is. What are your tips on living without a diagnosis, and not feeling hopeless?	undiagnosed
Fibromyalgia or Hypothyroid	I have severe insomnia. 4 months now. Cannot fall and stay asleep. Go days without sleeping. Sleeping pills work a few days then quit working. I had palpation when taking sleeping pills hr went from 65 to 150 in nothing flat. When I have palpitations hard to breathe. Has not done that since. I have Rheumatoid so I had bad joint pain. I had chest pain like burning of the rib cages a month before the insomnia. Back and neck pain. Before the insomnia I was sleeping 9 hours and felt unrefreshed. I have muscle spasm and myoclonus. Tingling and pain in the hands and feet. When I do not sleep burning all over. Been told the abnormal lab value was a high calcium which I has started taking a supplement 2 weeks prior and a low TSH but not enough to send me to an endocrine doctor.	undiagnosed
Undiagnosed for five years in Zimbabwe - please help!	Hi everyone. I’m writing to you from Zimbabwe, which if you’ve never heard of it, is a small African country just above South Africa and next to Mozambique. I’m looking for some advice about my mom – she’s had medical issues for the past five years or so and remains undiagnosed, but her symptoms seem to fit Addison’s Disease. This will probably be a pretty long post, but I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through it all, as I’m really desperate at this point. I just want to give you a little bit of background, as there may be severe emotional issues at play as well. My mom is 46, female, white, 5’4”, and about 130lbs. She was adopted at birth by a lovely couple who could not have children, and had a relatively happy childhood, although trauma may have been experienced as she grew up in the Rhodesian War. Her adopted dad passed away when she was 24 of a heart attack, and her adopted mom is still alive, but has Alzheimer’s. She lives in the UK and lost all of her savings when the Zimbabwean dollar crashed in 2008. My mom has told me that she was molested as a young child by another child that her parents has been thinking of adopting, although they never did. She was also raped in 2013 by an ex-boyfriend. She went through a string of bad relationships between 2010 to 2016, jumping from one to another. None were physically abusive, although I think there was some emotional abuse in some of them. She’s a single mother to myself and my younger sister and has no family here for support – financial or emotional. She was diagnosed with depression in 2013, and has suffered with it her whole life. She thinks that it’s related to her adoption. I’m now 23, but I was 17 and in my final year of high school when she first started exhibiting symptoms. My sister was 14. I dropped out of high school to work and support her, and also had to fund her medical costs, so there are some tests that were not run due to costs, although we did manage to do 99%. Cost is still a factor now, due to the hyperinflation currently occurring in Zimbabwe. She also lives in a town about 4 hours away from me. Okay so now the symptoms. In August 2014, whilst working an extremely high pressure and stress job, she exhibited the following: • Extreme anxiety and panic attacks • Insomnia • Alternating diarrhoea and constipation • Low blood pressure She was then diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, IBS, and a mental breakdown. She was prescribed Lithium, Amitriptyline, Bromazepam, and Piroxicam. After about two weeks, the symptoms seemed to subside, and she went back to work and life continued as per normal. Then, in February 2015, the symptoms reappeared, as well as some new ones. She was still working at the same job. Her full list of symptoms then were: • Extreme anxiety and panic attacks • Insomnia • Alternating diarrhoea and constipation • Low blood pressure • Tremor in her arms, most noticeable when trying to perform a task that requires control, such as buttoning a shirt • She walked with a strange gait, slightly bend over and shuffling. • Pigmentation on her face • Fatigue, even after getting a good night’s sleep • Excessive thirst, she would drink about 4 – 5 litres of water per day • A tingling sensation in her shins and calves when they were exposed to warmth – for example if she sat out in the sun, or if she was in a hot bath. She said it felt similar to pins and needles. • Brain fog and short-term memory loss. She wouldn’t remember conversation had the previous day, or if she’d left a pot on the stove. She was frequently confused during conversations. • Inability to regulate body temperature. She would be freezing cold and covered in goosebumps when it was warm, and put her jersey on, then get really hot and take it off again after 5 minutes, then get cold again. • Emotional. She would be crying all the time for no reason. Once after being at the shops, she accidently walked past our car in the parking lot, and then started crying because of it. • Body aches. Her body was aching constantly, mostly a 3 or 4 out of 10, but no pain medicines helped. The doctor ran blood tests for liver function, cholesterol, blood sugars, diabetes, lithium, a full blood count, thyroid function, hormones, vitamins, serums, lithium levels and a morning cortisol test. Her cholesterol was slightly high, urea was borderline low, and her lithium was low. Her cortisol level was 156 nmol/L. She had a raised eosinophil count on the FBC. All other results were normal. My mother was then referred to an endocrinologist who re-ran all the tests and did a physical examination. He found the following: • Pigmentation in her nail fold beds, creases on her palms, the skin of her face and neck, on all the sun exposed regions of her hands, feet, ankles, and arms, and on the surface of the buccal mucosa (the lining of the cheeks and the back of the lips inside the mouth where they touch the teeth) • Proximal muscle weakness in the legs • Postural hypotension, her BP dropping from 140/70 in the lying position to 115/20 in the sitting position • Nerve death in her lower legs, which was causing the tingling and the strange gait. • The repeat tests were normal – no elevated cortisol, blood ACTH level was normal, repeat FBC and thyroid functions, prolactin, liver functions – all normal. He then referred my mom to an endocrinology centre in South Africa, as he was at a loss as how to proceed. We travelled to Johannesburg and saw an endocrinologist there who was also at a loss. She conferred with her colleagues, and they suggested heavy metal poisoning. The blood tests for lead and arsenic disproved her theory, and the metals were 0 or too low to cause any effects. We returned home and then made an appointment with rheumatologist from the UK that was in the country for two months. He initially thought of lupus, but she was tested and did not have lupus. He then diagnosed her with Fibromyalgia. I was unhappy with this diagnosis, as was our GP as she said that my mom didn’t have the markers, so we then made an appointment with another endocrinologist. He had adbsolutely no theories at all and referred her to a psychiatrist. She saw the psychiatrist for two sessions, but she was so expensive that I couldn’t afford any more. Our GP then sent us to a neurologist and my mom had an MRI, which revealed no lesions at all. Amongst all of these tests, she’s also had various scans of her lungs, kidneys, EEGs, etc. Since then, she has been to several homeopaths and alternative medical professionals. One such person used headphones and electric current to find issues in the body. I’m afraid I can’t remember what the technique was, but she found only depression. Another homeopath used a ball that you squeeze, and it diagnoses you, but she also found nothing. She did prescribe my mom CBD oil for the pain, which she still takes, and it helps. But basically, that’s where we’re still at today. Some symptoms may be psychosomatic, but definitely not all of them, so it’s hard to rule out any symptoms as true or untrue. Just to summarise the conditions ruled out: Lupus, lung cancer, thyroid issues, diabetes, med side effects, heavy metal poisoning, kidney issues, brain tumour, fibromyalgia, vision issues, Celiac Disease. To anyone that made it all the way through – really thank you so much! I’m hoping someone can spot something I’ve missed.	undiagnosed
Frustrated and tired	This has been going on for a bit over ten years now and we still can't figure it out. I am a 24 yo female. I am in constant joint pain and can side from joint displacement. Basically my joints can dislocate and pop back into place with the wrong move. It isn't centralized in any address but it is worse in my knees, hips, ankles, and elbows. I am also hypermobile in all joints to the point where it causes extra pain. Some of my muscles are weaker than they should be, especially my hands. I have been tested for various arthritis disorders as well as various inflammation issues. All came up negative. I have been to physical therapy and although it helped somewhat, it didn't fix the issue. I am currently waiting to get an appointment with a genetics specialist to see if it is something there. I plan to ask about Ehlers Daniels Syndrome but is there anything else I should consider?	undiagnosed
Nausea is awful and stupid	It feels like my insides are doing a relay of deciding not to work. Sometimes swallowing doesn't make stuff go down. Sometimes my stomach takes forever to empty. Some times my small Intestine makes my belly feel like it's made of balloon animals. Sometimes my large intestine decides to not move for a week....and then evacuate everything in one day. I am very annoyed. I am so nauseous and my tum feels all burny and adrenaline-y. I don't know if that makes sense, but I just needed to vent. I dont feel well. Hxbdnsjksb. Tums didn't help. Pepto didnt help. Chewing on ginger helped a tiny bit... sigh. I'm trying to wait it out without taking gravol because it makes me sleepy (though it does help a bit) and I have to go to work soon.	undiagnosed
Undiagnosed Severe GI Issues - Going on Two Years Now	Alright. Here it goes. I have been dealing with some severe Gi/Rectal issues that have stumped doctors going on two years now. I have yet to find any sign of treatment that will help fix the problem, or even offer any real relief from the symptoms. While I’ve always had some issues with bowel movements and etc. throughout my life, the severity of the situation started in May of 2017. It may be best to simply bullet point the symptoms and feelings: &#x200B; * All of a sudden, one day I had an extreme and intense pressure in my rectum. * It’s a feeling that feels very localized to my rectum—so nothing with my stomach or anything of the like. * On top of being that pressure and presence, I would always feel like I needed to go to the bathroom (bowel). * I would be able to go multiple times a day, and yet always and consistently get to a point where I felt that I really needed to get something out—and yet I was unable to do anything. * Currently I still go 6-10 times a day (maybe more). Yet I still get to that point multiple times a day where I feel like I really need to go, but can’t. * To further clarify, this feeling/pressure/urge to go is ALWAYS there, and NEVER goes away. Only recently have I found that rare few seconds of respite…only for it to come back not too long after. * The more I go, the more whatever is causing that pressure gets irritated. So it doesn’t help that I go all the time. * The pressure/presence has been painful at times. * Important to note by saying that I go 6-10 times a day (often times more), that calculates how many times I am able to successfully have a bowel movement of some shape or size. That number does not include the times I go to the bathroom without any success. What have I done about this? Tons. The typical ER/Urgent Care/Primary doctor affair that turned up nothing. I had two surgeries (Anal Sphincterotomy twice over the course of eight or so months), along with about a year or so of consulting a surgical doctor that specialized in this area. When that came to a dead end, I was steered towards a Gastro specialist. After even more specialized screenings/tests, even he couldn’t come up with anything. I also saw a Physical Therapy specialist for the anal muscles, yet none of the stretches or things taught to me there aided me. Panic attacks after the useless second surgery led doctors to think it may be linked to anxiety/depression—so i was told to see a psychiatrist. So I’ve been seeing one for just under over a year and a half. Tried countless of medications. While they might have been doing something, recently I have come to possible discover that they may not have had any big affects. That they simply may have been red herrings/placebos for me to mentally latch onto as a potenial way of getting better.	undiagnosed
Crazy and horrible symptoms for years. No diagnosis.	"Hello all, I make this post in search of answers, or anyone out there who may have similar issues to mine. I'm going to try and cut this post as short as possible but at the same time try to give my best description of what is happening. If I went into detail about everything that has happened, this post would be way too long and I'd be typing for hours. I'm a 30yr old male. For the past few years, many strange mostly very painful symptoms have slowly progressively interfered with my life to the point where I can no longer work or function like a normal person. I am in so much pain that I have to constantly take controlled substances just to make it through the day. Before all of this started around 2014, 2015 or so, I never had ANY health problems whatsoever. I was born with an inner ear deformity that caused permanent hearing loss, but that is the only thing. I also have pectus excavatum and mild scoliosis because of it, but according to many doctors, these things are insignificant. The pain that I feel is a massive ""congestion"" type feeling that feels like blood or fluid is backed up in my body. This feeling intensifies greatly after sexual activity or going to the bathroom, or sometimes it intensifies just randomly. Sometimes it goes away, but over the last few months, it has not gone away at all and it is just beyond intense. Doctors won't prescribe me pain medicine because of the country-wide opioid crisis (United States). I think about suicide every day and how I am going to do it. Please keep in mind that these thoughts are not due to depression or hopelessness. It is simply because of the constant physical torture. I am very close to the point where I just simply can't take it anymore. It is way too intense. I have spent the last few years, starting around January 2017, constantly moving from doctor to doctor, hospital to hospital, trying to figure out what the hell is going on. EVERYONE is completely stumped. I am just at a complete loss for words that I can be in this much pain and absolutely NOTHING shows up on any test or imaging done. I have had countless MRIs, CT scans, and blood tests. Anything you can possibly imagine, I've had it done. I've been to the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and John's Hopkins medical centers. All of these places either gave me a false diagnosis or no diagnosis at all, because my symptoms are just so bizarre. My issue does not feel like actual ""chronic pain"". It feels like a blood flow or some type a fluid flow issue. It feels like fluid or blood gets backed up or stuck in random places in my body and causes very intense discomfort. Sometimes going to the bathroom or sexual activity, or some other random bodily function, like sneezing, can cause temporary relief. But the ""congestion"" pain always comes back. I am currently in the application process for the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. However, the acceptance rate is very low and it takes 6-8 weeks just for them to consider you as a patient. Honestly, I don't know if I can even make it that far. I am just so desperate at this point. I just don't know what to do. I am trying my very best to get through each day, and it is getting harder and harder. It is completely destroying me, my family, and everyone who cares for me. This is a cry for help. I really don't know what to do. It is just so intense. There is something seriously wrong with my body and at this point I don't know who can help me. If ANYONE could give me some sort of input or point me in the right direction. I would be so grateful. Thank you."	undiagnosed
Kindly help me	23 yo, male. Marijuana smoker for three years which got excessive in the last one year. Bad routine and not enough diet, plus masturbation once a day. I know, all on me. A month ago felt that I wasn't getting relieved after urinating. No matter how hard I tried, there'd be this feeling that some was left. And so had to go many times. For three four days, I was constantly aware of my urethral region. It was a nightmare. Went to doctor. Had urine culture done, uroflowmetry, ultrasound, sugar, all normal, kidney and bladder function, etc. Just the flow of urine was less. They said it's a psychiatric issue when I told them about marijuana use and prescribed anti anxiety meds. Although haven't taken them. Now it's been a month, I haven't used marijuana and neither will I do that ever. Started a good healthy regimen. Don't know what happened but it went away for 2-3 days, then came back. Now I have to go like 8-9 times a day, it was 3-4 earlier. And sometimes the slightest of urge is there even when I went 10 minutes ago. They've also said it's psychosomatic. But I don't know. If someone could help me?	undiagnosed

Rapid heart rate and back pain, not sure the cause	"My story begins in 2004, though 2004-2009 is possibly unrelated to what I'm having now. But to summarize quickly what happened in 2004, I had a month of: burning stomach, hot flashes and feeling generally miserable. After that month, I then spent 5 years where, basically, at night, when I laid down to sleep, I'd get heart palpitations and have to lean forward or sit up. Essentially I had to basically get back up and do other things for 2-3 hours until finally, somehow, I got to sleep without the palpitations. That'd cycle on for 3-4 weeks then I'd spend a month or two OK, then back to a few weeks of palpitations. I spent 5 years doing EKGs, an echocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound, even brain MRI. Nothing found. The only possible clue was that in 2008 I was furiously Googling to try and figure it all out, and found Lyme, and I remembered that in 2004 I had a red rash on my neck for 2 weeks at the beginning, and I thought it might be Lyme. But at that point, 5 years later, it was too long after to get a positive blood test, so I don't know. My 2004-2009 nightmare ended after I lost weight and started exercising. &#x200B; But then, fast forward to April 2018, now I am 41, I was riding in a car, and suddenly I felt nauseous and like something was very wrong (and in retrospect I had probably had rapid heart rate same as the incidents that came later), it stopped and only happened that one day. I went to the doctor a couple days later, they found nothing, but they didn't check much. I had gained weight again, so I ended up spending a few months losing weight and getting in great cardio shape. In June, I had a couple of weeks where I felt what felt like a rubber band putting a little bit of pressure around my head. Went to doc, found nothing wrong except high triglycerides and high C reactive protein (side note: by October those were both rock bottom low after 4 more months of exercise and avoiding the worst foods). &#x200B; In October I may have had a UTI or prostate infection, it appears to have went away. &#x200B; In December my new nightmare began, I had another incident like the one in April but this time unmistakable and unignorable rapid heart rate and arm shaking. No significant chest pain or shortness of breath. went to ER, they found nothing. Of note, that time it happened while driving. 4 days later, same thing, ER, found nothing. This time it woke me up at 2AM, not while driving. Then in the week after that I had some pale stool and some daytime non-driving occurrences of this, that were partly relieved by passing that pale stool. At that point I was beginning to have some back/side pain, not much but some, in addition to the rapid heart rate incidents. And of note, these were not all-day lasting, but, they also did not seem to be tied to a certain time after eating. During that week, I had a chest CT with iodine contrast, that found nothing but small lung granulomas. at the end of that week an external abdominal ultrasound found a gallstone and supposedly nothing else. Of note, the gallstone was mobile and no evidence of cholecystitis, but the doctor suggested that the gallstone was the problem. or at least at first. Now, this was during Christmas week at that point, and suddenly I began having hot and cold flashes, resting heart rate elevated all day long, severe diarrhea, and more. At first I thought it was anxiety but I quickly found out my T4 levels were high...and to skip ahead a bit, nothing was ever found wrong with my thyroid, it must have been from the iodine contrast. I took thyroid medication for a couple weeks but it ended up coming back down even without. 3 side notes: one, during the first week my thyroid was up (but before I knew that's what it was), I hardly ate for 3-4 days. After I started eating again, I had very slow digestion (I don't think it was constipation, just very slow digestion) and noticeable undigested food in stool. That took 2-3 weeks to recover. Two, I'd also lost about 17 pounds unexpectedly, although I know that weight loss started BEFORE those days I hardly ate. I can only assume that it was the high thyroid levels that caused it, but, I cannot definitely match up the dates because of the delay in finding out my thyroid was high. Of note, the weight loss did stop and hasn't started again. Three, during those weeks my thyroid was high, even after the thyroid medication got my resting heart rate under control, for a couple weeks there I really felt like my heart was weak, even when resting and my resting heart rate was in the normal area I expected. Additionally, just standing up, not even walking, would take my heart rate straight to 125 or so. Those have mostly recovered... &#x200B; Moving on, during the 3-4 weeks that my thyroid levels were up, yes, my resting heart rate was up, but interestingly, I did not have any of the extreme rapid heart rate incidents. But, a couple of weeks after my thyroid levels came back down, starting end of Jan/early Feb, I began having the specific rapid heart incidents again AND the back pain came back and this time some pretty regular pale stools. At first, the rapid heart rate incidents occurred almost exclusively driving or riding in a car, but over time they now happen at home or work sometimes too. &#x200B; So, I went back to doctors, at first to investigate the back pain, and another ultrasound was done. This time splenic hemangioma was found (and it was found on the December US in retrospect), but is assumed to be a non-significant finding. The gallbladder was also found unchanged...no evidence of cholecystitis, despite the gallstone. Apparently stable. A gastroenterologist reviewed it all and said yea, none of this looks like biliary colic. Seemingly ruling out the gallbladder...? &#x200B; Now, at this point, 3 weeks ago, the rapid heart rate incidents are starting to happen daily, so I go back to the doctor to move forward on that too. And long story short, they want me to try Buspirone, in other words, to see if anxiety's the cause. basically blaming it on anxiety, and I know that's not it, but, I've been taking it, because if I don't they'll say I didn't even try it, and if I'd argued about it up front, that might have been taken as proof that anxiety is correct. In any case, after 3 weeks of taking it, zero effect. Does nothing to prevent or lessen the incidents, and does not change my state of mind in any way because, there's no primary anxiety to treat. And at this point the rapid heart rate incidents have gotten frequent enough that I've gone to the ER again twice. Unfortunately they're mostly only doing cardiac workups, and finding nothing, and I'm convinced there is no cardiac cause anyway. Of course, I always mention the back pain and pale stool but that doesn't elicit much interest at the ER. Anyway, the ER, too, is claiming it's anxiety. Now, I understand Buspirone takes a few weeks to build up, and it has been 3 weeks anyway, but the ER gave me a 1mg lorazepam, which did absolutely nothing, not even drowsiness, and I still got a minor rapid heart rate incident on the way home. They also gave me a prescription for something faster acting than Buspirone, which is hydroxyzine. So, the next day before I was due to get my ride home (I can't drive anymore due to the risk of these incidents), I took the hydroxyzine about 2PM. It made me so sleepy that I had to nap for 2 hours at work, and on the way home I was drowsy with head lolling. And guess what? Rapid heart rate still occurred through the drowsiness! I don't know the reason this is happening a lot more often while in a car than at home or work, but the anxiety medications are not doing anything at all, except the side effect of drowsiness. Anxiety makes zero sense as a cause anyway; the symptoms came first, and it was as bad on the very first day it happened in Dec, back at a time when I didn't know anything was going to happen and thus had no anxiety about it. And no, there's nothing stressing me about work, or at home, and I don't have fear of riding or driving in cars, nothing. And then there's the back pain... for that,.they wanted me to try taking ibuprofen. Tried, did nothing. That pain too is getting worse, and more pale stool, and I'm beginning to get vague but extant aches in my front chest and epigastric area. Very vague, but still there, and starting to worry me as it has been going on over 6 weeks. It is unfortunate though that I have focused more of my appeals to the doctor on the heart rate rather than the back pain and pale stools....because the heart rate is easier to pin on something dismissive like anxiety than the pale stools are. In retrospect I'd have focused more on that... Here's a summary of tests I've done: Various EKGs all throughout last 3 months: nothing Various bloodwork- nothing (except thyroid as explained), multiple CMP, CBCs, insulin, etc. WBC were mildly elevated a couple times, that's it ER on 12/8, 12/12 and 12/19, standard cardiac workup and chest xray, nothing Dec14 : Chest CT, nothing but granulomas Dec 21: Abdominal US, gallstone but no cholecystitis, common bile duct non dialted and retrospectively, splenic lesion 1cm suggestive of hemangioma. ""Visualized portions of pancreas unremarkable, tail obscured"", everything else unremarkable Dec 27: T4 as high as 2.5ish, took methimazole for a couple weeks In the middle of my high thyroid days, I did go to the ER a couple of other times between Dec 23 and 27 thinking the gallbladder was infected...it wasn't. I probably would not have even gone those extra times if my thyroid hadn't been high, but it was. Jan 14: iodine uptake scan, 100% normal. At that point the doc decided the iodine from the CT must have caused the high thyroid Jan 29: Scrotal ultrasound normal, so no chance of a testicular tumor that could have affected thyroid Feb 15: Second abdominal US, gallstone still mobile, no evidence of cholecystitis, ""head of pancreas unremarkable, body and tail obscured by bowel gas artifact"", 1cm splenic hemangioma seen (and also seen in retrospective review of Dec 21 US), all else unremarkable Feb 28: Xray to look at chest/back, nothing found 3/5 and 3/12 ER, cardiac workup (except no xrays this time) shows nothing, and they also did CMP, nothing (although this time they did not provide me with the actual lab results so I don't know that for 100% sure) 3/7 Went to a dentist for xrays for good measure, need some work on 5-6 teeth but nothing seems infected 3/18: Did a treadmill stress test. 10.10 METS, comments on report basically said nothing wrong. This was ordered 6 weeks ago back when I was starting to have the rapid heart rate incidents again, but before I realized the back pain/pale stool was coming back, so at that point I saw a cardiologist thinking the rapid heart rate was all I needed to investigate, and he ordered the stress test. Heart problems seemed to be ruled out. Gallbladder was seemingly ruled out, but is it really? Given the location of the back pain (it matches the referred pain maps for gallbladder and liver referred pain), and the pale stool, I mean, it still could be the gallbladder, either that or the liver or pancreas. Although both ultrasounds found liver and pancreas unremarkable/normal echogenicity, and amylase/lipase/insulin and liver panels have always been right in normal range. I do think the heart rate and the back pain/pale stools are related though. The only good news is that the doctor has been willing to order a HIDA scan which should definitively determine if the gallbladder is the problem, but it won't look at anything besides the liver and gallbladder, and if it comes back negative, to me, the next step would be an abdominal CT to get a better look at pancreas than the ultrasounds did, but I don't know how I'm going to power through the doctor's desire to blame it all on anxiety/musculoskeletal back pain. I thought I had more time to humor them on the anxiety and costochondritis comedy routine, but the rapid heart rate is almost happening every day now and the back pain getting worse, and also the vague pains elsewhere are starting, so I can't just let it go. Any ideas? &#x200B;"	undiagnosed
I just want an answer	For over 5 years, I’ve had issues with my left foot. It has been swollen permanently for 5 years, and I’ve had pain in my left ankle, and issues walking for long periods for just as long. I never had any major issues, just wore a compression sock if it got bad. But 2 years ago, things changed. I started getting blisters on my second toe, and I would stick a bandaid on it and not worry. I woke up on a Friday, and could not bear weight on it without serious pain. I had an infection. My parents took me to the ER, and I was there for 36 hours, and watched as this ominous red line spread through my toe and up my foot. Luckily, the infection started receding before it got to my ankle. I was on bed rest for 2 weeks. I had blood tests, 2 ultra-sounds (from my hip to my toe), and an X-ray, and everything came back completely normal. Since then, I have had trouble getting moving in the morning, or after I’ve been sitting for a couple of hours. I can’t stay on my feet for long (which makes shopping hard haha) and my left knee is also starting to play up. I’ve never had issues in my right leg, and no problems with fluid retention, blisters or anything else like this anywhere else in my body, My GP is great, but we have no idea where to go next, so we’re just treating each symptom as it comes. All I want is a diagnosis. I’ve accepted that it’ll never get better, I just want to stop it getting worst, and have an answer.	undiagnosed
What do I do next?	"Hello all, My doctor and I have been working to try and sort out what is going on with mw for a few months now. I am super lucky to have an attentive and open doctor so he has been avtually listening to my symptoms and running all kinds of tests. However first set is all back (normal fml) and I have a follow up in 2 weeks to make a ""battle plan"" so I'm hoping to get some ideas from here to run past him. Symptoms: *Headaches: I used to get migraines a few times a month with weather changes, hormonal changes, or gehydration. I now have headaches (sometimes mild, sometimes full migraine with sensitivity and vomiting) every single day. Changed pretty suddenly in the last 8 months. *Unexplained nausea/vomiting: I keep waking up between 3-5 am, seemingly for no reason. I will wake up about every 10 minutes for a while, then have a sudden rush of nausea, sometimes but not always followed by vomiting. Usually feel better after. Sometimes repeats an hour or so later. I also get rushes of nausea throughout my day that gobaway within a few minutes. *Chest tightness/fluttery heart feeling: Just that. Sporadically in my day, goes away in a few monutes usually. The chest tightness has been getting worse this week. Finally, just a few weeks ago I got a tiny scrape on my knuckle that somehow resulted in me full on passing out? I have never fainted before, and am very unbothered by blood or injuries. It took a full 5 or so minutes to actually lose consciousness, when I did I was only out for a minute or so? Woke up breifly to tell my Fiance I was peeing (so embarassing) and he called the ambulance. (They cleared me on arrival and we agreed not to go to the hospital as all their stuff came up fine.) Most concerning part here is the loss of bladder control... I have an MRI coming in April, and a 24 hour holter monitor going on today. We have checked my thyroid, my glucocse, my blood pressure, a bunch of other bloodwork (cant find the paper urgh) and did an EEG which came back normal. I have other really odd symptoms but at this point I have no clue what is related and what isn't and I have 0 trust for my body right now, so just ask!"	undiagnosed
Suffering for 2+ years - help wanted	Hi, I guess I'm writing this from a place of desperation, as my partner has been suffering with an undiagnosed condition for over 2 years now, and he's really gotten to a point of giving up hope. It's hard for me to explain his symptoms, because they're a bit all over the place, but I'll give it a go. It all started when he took 2 very long flights and when he got off the plane he had headaches and motion sickness for about 3 months. Eventually the motion sickness subsided, however occasionally he still feels as though the world is rocking or swaying. (He has been checked for vertigo and tinnitus etc. at a Ear, Nose and Throat specialist and all they found were pullups in his nose which can cause mild discomfort of the sinus region). These headaches have persisted every single day since then. They are annoying, but he has kind of learnt to deal with these daily headaches most of the time. It is not these headaches that are his main concern (although they do affect his mood and ability to work). He has these episodes where he gets really weird symptoms. Sometimes it is light sensitivity, or numbness or the arm or part of the face, he can get flashes of pain in his chest or parts of the head, he gets strange feelings in his head (I can't really explain since I don't personally get them). He has had an MRI and it came back clear except for some evidence of possible migraines. So he was diagnosed with having migraines, but the issue is none of the migraine medications help. He takes nortriptyline daily and has tried heaps of other meds e.g. topomax, sumatriptan etc but none help. He's tried chiropractors, osteopaths, physiotherapists etc. Etc. We've seen multiple specialists and they all just say its migraines, but it doesn't seem to fit very well. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Or does anyone else have any idea what could be wrong or what other treatments we can try? Thanks!!!	undiagnosed
I’ve had a hell of a morning.	I’m a college student and I just spent $2,000 fucking dollars on an endoscopy to see why I’m having constant stomach pains, nausea, and diarrhea. Want to guess the result? Absolutely nothing wrong! No ulcers, no inflammation, not even old healed ulcers. I am 100% fucking HEALTHY. And now, because of that, I’m going to be going to school full time and working at least 20 hours a week. I study engineering, and while some people are good at it, I am not. I have family I like to visit on weekends. That’s not happening. I’m a leader of a club. That’s gotta go away. I’m also married, and that’s not a problem, but my husband has his own undiagnosed issues that look a lot like MS- extreme fatigue and his legs buckle and fail a lot. So I try to help out with him. So basically what I’m saying is a lot of time just went down the drain so I could get this ABSOLUTELY USELESS procedure. I fucking hate my body for this. Anytime something’s wrong, it’s diagnosed healthy and I just deal with it. Fucking great.	undiagnosed
Excessive mucus	Looking for answers. Mucus builds up daily and makes him throw up. It's so bad that he feels like he is choking. He has had this condition since childhood and now an adult it hasn't stopped. He says he has been to the doctor yet no answers. Is there anyone out there that can relate?	undiagnosed

Need an answer because I can't take it anymore	I've read that Reddit has helped solve some mysteries. It's been a few years now I started to get this cold feeling in the upper part of my arm when the temperature drops or when I'm an an air conditioned place. It started as a small area in my arm and ever since then it's spread to both my arms, neck, chest and now my face. I have seen about 3 or 4 neurologist's and had tried different medications and nothing seems to help. Two of them have sent me to get an MRI to see if what could be causing this. All of the doctors I've seen either tell me that i should have gotten this when I was little due my my car accident, fibromyalgia or they simply don't know what's wrong with me. I'm up to the point where I can't take it anymore and I just want to know what's going on with me. If anyone knows or could know what is wrong I would greatly appreciate it!	undiagnosed
Neurological issues following getting Flu like symptoms last month	M 22, 5’11” 221 ilbs Non smoker Caucasian Non drug use No alcohol use. June 28th- Current date Hey everyone. Thanks for taking the time to read this. (Positive for band 41 on Western Blot) I have been going through the worst month and a half of my life and it’s putting me in a very bad spot mentally. In the middle of June I found some small black thing 2x the size of a poppy seed maybe. It was 1am, was in bed. And I found it directly underneath my groin. I had to remove it with tweezers. Couldn’t tell what it was but I assume it could’ve been a tick, it also wasn’t moving when I removed it? So skip to a week and a half later. I end up getting really bad flu like symptoms. ( Night Sweats, Fever, Swollen Lymph Nodes, Chills, Weakness, Sore Throat) Urgent care just gave me Amoxicillin and said it was more than likely an upper respiratory. 2 days in on that I had horrible sores throughout my mouth and Thrush (Candida) Few days after that I started getting really bad neurological issues. - Memory Loss - Vertigo - No Depth Perception - Confusion - Cognitive Decline - Feeling like the left side of my head is empty - Bipolar cycling - Some hearing sensitivity - Left ear feels like fuzz always I felt like I was living in a bad fever dream What’s worse is I’m self aware of how horrible this all is. It’s like the entire left side of my head has been filled with molasses. I can’t think straight or logically. I can’t be creative. I don’t feel like myself. I started getting kidney pains and have begun the need to constantly have to urinate. Even my most recent blood work came back saying my kidney function was slightly below my normal amount. And my New Born White Blood Cell Count has been slightly elevated as well. I’ve seen a few different doctors and they all just say because my blood work has come back pretty clean that there’s nothing wrong with me and sent me home. I’ve been to the hospital 2 times. I’m absolutely mortified. The only remaining symptoms are - Memory Loss - Cognitive decline - Numb feeling in head - occasional dizziness. - Hearing issues. - Eye floaters - Feeling worse in the night/ Morning Thank you -Current supplements I’m taking - Paleo Vegan diet - Black Seed Oil (7-27-18)✅ - Colloidal Silver (7-15-18)✅ - B12 (7-15-18)✅ - Lion’s Mane (7-25-18) ✅ - Garlic (7-25-18)✅ - Coconut Oil Pills (7-27-18)✅ - Super Omega 3’s (7-19-18)✅ - Uridine (7-27-18)✅ - Choline (7-27-18) ✅ - Phosphatidyl Serine (7-27-18)✅ - Tulang Honey ✅ - Olive Leaf Extract ✅	undiagnosed
Can anyone help piece together these symptoms?	I’m posting this on behalf of someone else. I’m not a Reddit user, but I’ve found that this is a good outlet for issues of this sort. I also want to be honest in saying that I don’t have the full spectrum of their symptoms/issues, however, I have a good base for asking you all here. I am also being as discreet as possible for certain reasons, but I am more than willing to discuss further through private messaging. They’ve been dealing with these issues for approximately 2 years. In the beginning, they traveled in search of an answer, and came up empty. They’ve progressively gotten worse to where they cannot do much other than small, basic, household tasks. They’re only able to lay in one position due to pain, their stomach is very sensitive to certain foods, and it is painful for them to eat. They’ve lost a great deal of weight and are EXTREMELY underweight. They’re losing hair as well. Bed sores have become a major issue because of their inability to lay in positions other than the one. They are not able to leave the house, and at this point have not been able to for approximately 2 years. It seems to have gotten to a point that this has caused depression and mental issues that are preventing them from wanting to seek any more medical attention, as well as they feel they are too weak and doctors will cause harm if they do seek out more help. I’m scared and worried because my loved ones are not wanting to push them into getting anymore help and are basically trying to make them as comfortable as possible until they die. They are around 40 years old, so this is something that hurts me deeply. They are too young for family to not want to do everything they can to help them. I hope someone can help me, and I hope you aren’t offended by my discreetness as I don’t know the reddit culture very well. This is something that is greatly affecting me personally and I decided to take matters into my own hands since no one else is willing to step up and do so. Again, I’m willing to answer any more personal in depth questions privately (reddit has that right?). Please help!!!	undiagnosed
Unexplainable illness, legs covered in now football sized wounds some 1/4 in. deep that do not heal and get bigger over time, and is slowly spreading to rest of body.	My sister has, for the last several years, had this condition where small wounds, can even be as small as scratching an itch, will get worse over time and not heal, eventually resembling large bumpy red burns, with currently about 70&#37; of her legs covered and just her legs, and just last week now one on her stomach. Presumably, a guess by a doctor, the capillaries are dissolving near the wound, causing less and less blood to get to the area, thus causing the wound to widen and deepen over time. It's a constant battle to keep them from getting infected, and we fear the worst if it ever does. Recently her fingernails have grown weak, they crack and split when trying to manipulate simple things like bending paperclips. She has seen and is currently seeing multiple doctors and for a time a panel of many, all to no avail. All tests come back negative, no parasites or evident viruses at play. Her veins are also very quick to collapse, she now has a port in her chest for easy access to blood for the occasional test. We get a 3' by 3' box of pads and gauze every week to keep the wounds covered. At this point I want to get this ridiculous story out there, but any suggestion at all would definitely be appreciated. Before this I guess it would be hard to impossible to imagine the pain of people with undiagnosable and probably fatal diseases, I can see how it would be so easy to feel forgotten by society with no help coming. Sad affair all around. Keep the spirits up and dreams happy guys!	undiagnosed
Eye Condition - Eyes Swell Shut - Chronic for 7 Years	Hi Reddit, This is my first time making a post. My life has been effectively destroyed by a medical condition that remains undiagnosed. Every few days one or both of my eyes have conjunctivitis (pink eye) symptoms that are so severe that one or both must remain closed after they basically swell shut. This started in 2011 when I found myself with pink eye and went to urgent care. I took some antibiotics and it went away. Over time, it happened more frequently and more violently. I've seen something like 6 or 7 eye doctors, seen ear nose and throat specialists, allergists, specialists that specialize in infectious diseases, surgeons that specialize in tear ducts (thought it was tear duct blockage for a while but apparently that just causes extra tearing) and countless GPs. Symptoms: 1. I start to feel pressure and discomfort in the corners of my eye. 2. Eye feels dry and eye starts to produce a discharge that's colored anywhere from clear to dark brown. The crusty stuff at first. 3. Eyelids start to swell and discomfort accelerates. 4. Discharge starts to go crazy and the only thing that makes the pain manageable is to close the eye entirely. 5. Discharge drains down my face, usually a green-brown color. 6. Pain and pressure start to get really bad and it's difficult to concentrate/sleep/etc. 7. Eyelids swell and the tissue around the area gets really inflamed. 8. Symptoms start to recede and gradually the eye returns to normal. It doesn't appear to be an allergy as I've completely moved from one environment to another, lived without a cat for 6 months, quit smoking for 6 months, slept on a couch in case I was allergic to memory foam, completely changed my diet and then back and a million other things. I'm also on antihistamine nasal spray and eye drops right now just to completely eliminate the possibility (it isn't helping). I've tried antibiotics over the course of entire year whenever I got initial symptoms and it does nothing. Steroids help with the healing process but you can't do that long term and it only helps a little bit. I have to wear mirrored sunglasses all the time because this is horrifying to look at. Anyone have similar experiences or have any ideas? I'm not sure what exactly to cover but I'm having no luck and the next step is to submit myself for some sort of study. Any help is appreciated, thanks!	undiagnosed

Seen Doctor, ER, and Gastro.... Still No Answers!	Hi, I'm Austin! Since June 20th 2016 I have been waking up every morning between 5 and 7 am writhing in pain and needing to run to the restroom. When I use the restroom it is usually an hour or two of hot lava spewing from my back end. In the beginning I threw up a lot but that has mostly subsided. After using the restroom, my stomach just hurts, feels bloated, gassy, and cramped. I have very little appetite, but once I do eat I fill up immediately. Then it is just a continuation of the stomach ache until morning where I repeat that schedule. What has been done so far: Gastric Emptying, stool sample, blood sample, CT scan, CT scan with iodine, gallstone ultrasound, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and I have a HIDA scan scheduled for next Friday, also waiting on the results of a food sensitivity blood test. Medications I am on: Zoloft, Xanax (only taken when travelling), dyciclomine, dexilant, vitamin d pills, IBguard / FDguard, and promethazine. Medications I have taken: everything above, xifaxan, assorted pro biotics, assorted anti biotics. Final notes: Things tend to be the worst in the mornings, I have tried cutting out certain foods, and am seeing a chiropractor weekly.	undiagnosed
Seen Over a Dozen Doctors and No Diagnosis Yet	"I've been poked and prodded, and scanned over the past 7 years, and still no diagnosis. I've completely lost trust in the competency of most doctors because of the unscientific way that most of them approach problems that they can't affix a quick label to and prescribe a pill for. My family, though for the most part is supportive, still makes frustrating and dismissive suggestions about what I need to do for my health. ""Oh, have you seen a naturopath?"" ""Maybe you're sensitive to gluten?"" ""I read this thing in this book, and it probably is migraines""... The list goes on and on. My husband thinks I'm being lazy when I don't want to go out because I'm so fatigued. Symptoms like numbness, weakness, confusion, and other vague and fleeting sensations just don't elicit the sympathy and understanding that a tummy ache or fever does, even though they can by symptoms of serious diseases. I am lucky to have great medical care now, and am gradually getting closer to a diagnosis. There are a lot of objective tests that still need to be done. I'm convinced now that this is not an unsolvable mystery, just doctors rely too much on subjective diagnostic criteria. I have lumps under my skin that need to be examined, and probably biopsied. I had a high white blood cell count in my spinal fluid several years ago. They need to do another lumbar puncture. There are still blood tests for certain cancers, and autoimmune disorders that they can do. I don't have MS, migraines, lupus, gluten intolerance, or a thyroid deficiency. These are things that have been tested for. What me and doctors are still going to look at is: Sjogrens, lymphoma, paraneoplastic syndrome, and the cancers that could cause it, sarcoidosis.. Sorry about my disorganized rant!"	undiagnosed
It's been 10 years for me.	I just wanted to say a few things. I'm glad Reddit has an undiagnosed subreddit, but I wish it was stronger. More posts, more users, etc. I have been on this trainwreck of a stumbling, fumbling journey for 10 long years. My disease has left me unable to work, despite my best efforts, and my state chose not to expand Medicaid. Clinics only help with the basics, and I don't qualify for charity programs. And a doctor has to submit each case to the Undiagnosed Diseases Program, and a doctor has to request genetic sequencing. There are very few reduced-cost copay programs, and I either don't qualify for them, or I have stumped the doctors there. So I don't qualify for any kind of health insurance. I can't get a diagnosis, because I can't get help. And I can't get help, because I don't have a diagnosis. This issue has nearly left me homeless. I've already done CrowdMed, and I've already emailed talk show hosts, started a GoFundMe campaign, emailed the White House and my governor, called every clinic in my state, tried to get a lawyer, all of it. And CrowdMed was the only thing that was helpful. Unfortunately, you have to get your CrowdMed diagnostic suggestion confirmed with a physician in person. Which I can't afford. So I'm still undiagnosed. Along the way, as I have dragged my carcass through this journey, I like to at least think that I have learned what works and what doesn't. I have had journalists publish articles about me, and I have published articles about my experience as well. But it doesn't do any good. Doctors either refuse to listen or refuse to help. Right now, I am going to a local reduced-copay doctor's office. He is wiling to conduct any test I need, but this doctor's office will be paying for it all out of pocket. They can't blow the entire budget on one patient, so they are limited. I am thinking about getting some blood tests from the University of Washington's Collagen Diagnostics Lab, (skin biopsy, TAAD panel, NSG panel) having UW bill me, then apply for UW's financial assistance program. I haven't had an income since 2008, so it should be a shoe-in. My next appointment is not until September 24th, and I am stuck just biding my time until then. Such is the never-ending struggling just to find out what's killing me. I have dedicated everything I have to trying to help myself, since no one else will. I have done all my own research, called, emailed, chased new leads, and followed up, all on my own. All while everyone around me constantly chastised me, minimized my illness, and told me I was just being lazy. All while trying to avoid homelessness. Thus concludes my rant for the day.	undiagnosed
Poor working memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, concentration, lethargy, lack of sad emotions, sluggishness, physical inflammation and weakness.	"**Symptoms:** - Bad working memory (cannot remember on the go, struggle forming sentences or finding right words, hard to do simple calculations) - Bad short-term memory (forget about something I planned to do or something that I already thought about, forget people's names, song names, words in general) - Bad long-term memory (Can't remember almost anything from my past) - Concentration (Hard to read a single sentence, hard to read something for a long time, hard to engage on conversations without thoughts coming in) - Brain fog (Sometimes I cannot think straight and have a cloudy mind) - Lethargy (I don't feel attracted to any superficial thing like normal people do E.g. any form of devotees, lack of motivation to do things or move from bed) - Lack of sad emotions (I never feel sad, angry, or emotional about anything. I do feel a lot of empathy, love, positivism. I always have a smile on my face and I'm really content with my life but the only thing that worries me is my inabilities but it is just fear for the future, it stresses me yet doesn't make me sad) - Sluggishness (I feel tired like I need more sleep most of the time) - Physical inflammation (Pain all over my body specially when sitting or standing for long periods of time, the pain subsides when cracking my bones but then it builds up again and sometimes it doesn't stop) - Weakness (Just overall weak E.g. I always have to use very mild weights at the gym and doing long exercises is difficult and my body gets a lot of inflammation post-workout) **My life story:** I'm a 20 year old guy that has struggled throughout my whole life specifically upon anything that involves a mind working task. I remember an outrageous small number of things that happened in my life. Most of them are since 4 years ago but anything before that is really hard to think about. The things that I remember has to be something really special or important that happened (this memories are not vivid, I just get a little visual feedback but not how everything happened) and the most vivid memories are from something that I shared with someone or thought much about (telling a story or daydreaming an event). Non of my memories fall under a timeline, I'm completely disoriented with time and at what stage I had an experience. E.g. I cannot assign a year, month, or day to any of my memories. Even for recent events is hard for me to think about what happened last week or even 1-2 days ago. Luckily is not like I completely lose my memories I can probably still remember if someone gives me a detailed explanation of what happened in that event. But I repeat, this is more pronounced in the last 4 years. It is like my brain is not able to function or remember without hints or external stimulation. And this only helps me remember the specific event not the period or the things that happened before or after that event. I was apparently a high distinction student till 3rd grade (I had probably 7-8 years old) and I have a faded memory that at 4th grade I couldn't ""apparently"" (I don't know if at that stage something happened to me or just the studies got out of my capabilities) focus anymore and it was really hard to study and do homework. Since then, I had bad grades and struggled to get through the school years. I've always been really scared of failure so since I was not able to concentrate I found my ways around it by plagiarizing or doing acceptable work that would keep me going but this was more like a flight or fight response while getting a crazy amount of stress for my inabilities. Somehow I managed to get through all my years without failing a single one. I had extension for some classes but still got through and at the last years of school I developed a really efficient way of plagiarizing and doing homework to just get that passable score. Because of this, my parents never got too worried about my performance and they didn't know I was doing all of this to get through. In this period I always thought I was ""too smart"" to be losing my time doing school work that will not help me in the future or ""too lazy"" because I didn't put the effort or responsibility upon them. Since I had a lot of free time from not doing homework, I got into computers and videogames and I was really skilled at it. The memory and concentration problem was still there but since it became my passion I would bring out the best out of me and just as clever as I was on plagiarizing I was clever on the computer. I began to think about the future and I was really convinced I would study something computer related and always kept on the back of my mind that when that time comes I'll stop being ""lazy"". Then the time came, I traveled abroad to study IT and that's where I began to realize all my inabilities. I had a strong motivation at the beginning and solely focused on my studies. As I began my degree I was getting HD on my assignments but not because I could concentrate or remember, I was lucky that the degree was mostly based on practical work and the only memorizing based work was quizzes and essays which again I ended up plagiarizing because I couldn't read and hated writing for the same reason. Even the practical work I would stress because I had to think and took me a long time to get started on doing it and while doing it I would rush through it to get over, but ended up landing really good grades. In this period I also started working for the first time, in a catering kitchen as a kitchen hand. And I was also lucky that it required almost not much thinking but my memory was the worst at this point. I would forget simple tasks they told me to do all the time but they were compassionate and they kept reminding me. Also I started getting nerve pain in my feet, inflammation in my knees, hips, back, neck, shoulders, hands and pretty much all my body from standing for too long. Here is where I got the most concerned about my physical and mental health and decided to do everything I could to feel better. I began exercising, doing yoga, meditating, taking supplements, started a healthy diet, 8+ hours of sleep, self-improvement and I began to feel a little bit better on behalf of my physical health, energy, mood and discipline. Also I began drinking coffee and it helped me slightly with my cognitive abilities and a lot with my short-term energy. Then when I thought I was ready to focus in my studies again, I started a calendar to organize myself where I encouraged to do an online course on Android development, got the course and assigned 2 hours a day to it. Starting from the first day, I sat down and tried to study but I still couldn't focus and got so irritated about it that I couldn't continue and set excuses about it that maybe it was because I didn't sleep well or maybe because I was drinking coffee in the morning and then I would crash in the afternoon and a number of ruminating thoughts about what is keeping me from focusing. This became a limbo and I never got better but I would keep trying until I remembered that I've always been like this and I cannot keep naturally trying to fix myself. That's when I began researching about ADD, SCT, Depression and I was so radical about it that I would read about anything that could be the culprit of my issues every single day while being a lurker. I ended up discovering Sleep apnea and all the symptoms where really similar to mine and I knew I had to get a sleep study to know if I had it specially because when I read about it I remembered 2 or 3 times that I woke up during the night gasping for air. At this point, I actually wanted to have it because that meant that I could get treatment even if I had to sleep with a mask but I just wanted to feel better and after the study it was not it. The sleep physician asked me why I took the study, I told him all my symptoms and he decided to prescribe me Mirtazapine (antidepressant) that he told me would make me sleep better and fix my concentration and memory issues. The next 2 months were the worst in my life I had even worse concentration and I felt like a living zombie everyday. Interestingly, I was having really vivid dreams and sort of began recalling small things about my past also my palms which are normally really sweaty were not much anymore but not anything more than that. Eventually the physician told me that Mirtazapine didn't work and that he cannot keep assessing me and that I needed to see a psychiatrist and he change my meds to Effexor. Since effexor I had a major improvement, my mood got really elevated, my short-term and long-term memory improved slightly and my social-anxiety was gone. I have been feeling really good ever since. I seek for a psychiatrist and it took me a 5 month wait to get an appointment . One month ago he ended up diagnosing me with ADD and Depression. And added dextroamphetamine on top of the effexor. Since, for the first time I've been able to sit down to do mental tasks but my memory is still very poor and that's why I'm still thoughtful about whether I have something else or maybe my brain got damaged for such a long time from being undiagnosed or maybe I have trauma that make my brain work non optimally. I just don't understand what could be the main cause. I have to point that my parents have apparently been really tough when I was young but I don't remember and my brother have a number of pathologies (Chemical Sensitivity, Electromagnetism sensitivity, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) I thought It was essential to tell my story to have a better understanding of my symptoms and maybe there's something important that can help understanding what's wrong. I am really thankful if someone managed to read everything and I would really appreciate any insight or thought anyone can give. **Current Meds/Supplements**: - Effexor 75mg - Dextroamphetamine 20mg - Vitamin D3 1000iu - NAC 600mg (Sometimes) - Just stopped taking Fish oil but I took it for 2 years - Glucosamine - Vitamin C (Just started) - Magnesium Glycinate (Just started)"	diagnoseme
