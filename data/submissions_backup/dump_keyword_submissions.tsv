Request: I have no idea what's happening to me. Graves Thyroid Disease, hypothyroid, hormone replacement therapy	I don't know where to start. I was overweight for a decade. It never bothered me. Not even a little. Suddenly, I lost a very large amount of weight. To the point that I was underweight. I was diagnosed with Graves Thyroid Disease, which for me, the onset was extreme. Also, with the disease, you're always extremely hungry, and can eat whatever you want around the clock, and you're still losing weight. So for four months, I ate nothing but junk and in huge amounts. Everyone smothered me with compliments. And then I got diagnosed, and went on medication to slow down my thyroid. I should also mention that while people were showering me with praise, I was really sick. My hair was falling out, I was having panic attacks every night, extreme palpitations, the whole nine. I was at high risk for cardiac arrest the whole time I was undiagnosed. That's Graves, and it's horrible. Anyways, my thyroid slowed down. I gained a little weight back, but I was still a healthy weight for my height. It didn't bother me. Fast forward about six months. Suddenly, it was like a light bulb lit up. I decided I wanted to lose the weight I'd gained. I set a goal weight for myself and started exercising, and counting calories with one of those stupid phone apps. So I did that for awhile, and approached my goal weight. For some reason, that wasn't good enough. I set a new goal weight. When I got to that one, that wasn't good enough either. I was weighing myself obsessively. I stopped exercising, lost all energy. I saw where this might be going, so I stopped calorie restricting. I started eating whatever I wanted. I went to the Endocrinologist, and found out to my surprise, that the Graves disease, which is autoimmune, successfully destroyed my thyroid. Which means, I am hypothyroid, and my metabolism is way slower than a healthy person's. That thought makes me panic. I'd only gained back a tiny amount of weight, I'm still slightly underweight. I started on thyroid hormone replacement therapy two weeks ago. All I think about is food, and my weight, but I still eat junk when I feel like it...only to feel deep regret afterward. It's like there's something wrong, and I know it, but I'm refusing to let it stop me from eating what I want. Yet, it's always on my mind. My question is...what's happening to me? What did happen? I was overweight for years and it didn't bother me one bit. Even when my mother was pointing it out and telling me how unattractive I looked. I knew she was just being horrible, and I felt perfectly comfortable in my own skin. I was a healthy weight up until I graduated high school, and then I started taking a certain medication that caused me to become overweight, and I wasn't bothered by that, either. I feel like most girls would have been horrified, but not me. I was okay. So...can I get some feedback about this? And how to stop myself from going down this road? I feel like when this hypothyroid thing got thrown into the mix, it made everything so much worse. I'm always thinking about eating and not eating. I better go back to restricting my intake because I could be paving the road to being overweight again. Which, to me, seems like a nightmare if it were to happen. I don't get it. I really want to stop thinking about food so much, I really want to stop constantly examining my legs to see if they've gotten any bigger, and checking to see if I can still feel my hip bones...I've successfully stopped weighing myself every day, but that's about it. My husband, who is wonderful and loves me very much, keeps telling me that I could be three times my size and he'd still love me to pieces. It's not that I want to impress anyone by being so small, I don't need to. It's just me, something going on with me. What do I do? What is this?	EatingDisorders
Crazy health anxiety...anyone? Natural therapies?	I'm a 30 year old female. A traumatic event happened to me in spring of 2014 health wise that could have killed me. I ended up needing a crazy surgery and being hospitalized and on follow up drugs (blood thinners) for 6 months. Ever since that event, it's like a switch went off in my brain that turned health anxiety on. I can't seem to shake it. Although it has gotten a lot better (after counseling) I am genuinely afraid of having an underlying undiagnosed disease that will kill me. I even went as far as to get genetic testing done but I know that genes don't determine my future... I am the most terrified of cancer and neurological disorders. Basically, I worry too much and in 2015 I want to stop this cycle. What has helped all of you in terms of supplements and natural therapies? I don't want to waste my life worrying about the unknown. I feel that around PMS time every month this anxiety gets A LOT worse. I'm not sure why. Thanks all!!!	Anxiety
Doctor just confirmed my fears - I have AS. Thank you for this sub and all the info here. This is my story:	Hello all. Here is my story, I hope you don’t mind if I vent a bit. I have battled spinal inflammation for years now. I’m currently 34, the pain started at age 25 as annoying sciatic pain and general discomfort at the base of my spine. I had X-rays and an MRI way back then and the tests didn’t show anything that led docs to think it was spondylitis. I was treated for bulging discs. Now years later, worsening pain and two separate battles with uveitis have pushed me to the edge and my doctor recommended testing for AS. On December 31st 2014 I came back positive for HLA-B27 and blood sediment test shows inflammation markers obviously. X-Rays came back showing a change, scarring and sclerosis in my SI joints and hips. My first go 'round with uveitis (Christmas 2012) was pretty scary, mildly infuriating and very painful. I put it off for a week thinking it was a stye, and then went to urgent care as it didn’t get better. They treated it as pink eye and gave me antibiotic drops and it continued to get worse. The pain finally pushed me over the edge (I have a very high pain threshold after years of back pain) and I went to the emergency room. I hated to be that guy, the pussy in the ER with eye pain. The ER docs didn’t see it that way to my surprise. I went through hours of testing including awkward pressure tests for glaucoma with an [archaic instrument](http://www.gilai.com/images/items/1862_big.jpg) that looked better suited to help Magellan navigate the south pacific than anything medical related in the year 2012. Finally an ophthalmologist was called in, apparently right off the street. This schlub came in wearing jeans and a t-shirt and exhibited the worst bedside manner I have ever encountered. No gloves, thumbing his nose and then touching my eye and the like. He immediately starts into the spondylitis speech. I was floored, I had no clue about the disease and without any sort of blood test here is this doctor telling me my spine is going to fuse together into one piece. I mean…he wasn’t wrong, he was just an asshole. Anyways, the best part about my stupid negligence regarding my eye was that I now needed a steroid injection, directly into my eyeball. Now obviously my eye had to be open to receive the injection and as a bonus I could witness this horror show. To add insult to injury this doctor was so visibly excited about my eyball injection that he assembled a crew of giddy doctors, adorable nurses and fresh faced students to see me squirm in agony while he performed his little show. Fucks sake man, what a day. On my way out the door he told me I would likely never see the same again out of this eye and reminded me that without a doubt my spine would be one solid piece very soon. Well, needless to say I didn’t want to see that guy anymore even though he insisted. My eye sight returned 100% with some steroid drops. I do have some scarring in my eye and some of my iris flaked off and is floating around in there, but I can see just fine so I’m happy. At that time in my life I didn’t have any health insurance so I wasn’t about to go chasing down this rare auto-immune disease that I obviously didn’t have. Some crazy New Delhi street doctor couldn’t possibly know what he was talking about…and I felt fine, well normal for me – tired and in pain. Fast forward to Christmas 2014, this time of year my back seems to get worse. Hunting season comes around and I can’t sit in a tree stand without total discomfort and now I’m starting to get some redness and pain in my eye….the other eye now! Reality sinks in, I know in the back of my head what is about to happen. My wife thinks I’m just stressed but I know…the disease, AS, this is real. I went to the doctor and sure enough, its uveitis again. Getting this eye infection once can happen to anyone, twice and doctors start to think your body is attacking itself. Tests are ordered up, steroid drops are administered (no injection since I was not as stubborn this time and caught it early.) I get an oral steroid for the back inflammation which at this point has gotten so bad I can’t bear it. The worst I’ve ever had…it dropped me to my knees at work and I couldn’t get up, which was so embarrassing. So here we are, as I said the tests came back positive and now I know where I stand. I’m relieved in a way; at least I know what’s going on and can move forward with treatment. I also know the pain is my normal pain, just way worse. I know how to work through it like I have for all these years and that makes me happy. I had stopped exercising and stretching thinking maybe I finally blew out a disk and I needed to rest, that was making me feel worse. Now since the diagnosis I am back at the gym and doing yoga every day. I feel ok, I’m optimistic but this is serious. It has been a little frustrating telling people what’s going on, they google the disease and then come back saying ‘it’s not that bad, you need to exercise, and eat right - starch is bad anyways, this is actually good for you!’ ugh. I know, they are trying to keep me optimistic but god damn, this can be really bad. I know what I need to do and for me that is not easy but I can do it. I really want to go the active route. Stretch, exercise, eat right and gulp – drink little to no alcohol. I’m currently on Meloxicam, previously shitloads of ibuprofen. I’m taking Vicodin so I can get though a day at the office in a chair and workout at the gym. I really, really am terrified as all fuck of the side effects related to Humira injections. I just don’t want to go that route, at all. I have yet to see a Rheumatologist; probably early next week will be my first visit. I have worked through the pain in my own way for at least 2 years, probably more likely 5 years undiagnosed and I am quite flexible. I want to stretch and be healthy. I don’t want to inject myself with Humira – please don’t take that the wrong way. I know a lot of you are further along in your fusing than I am and if it works for you then that is awesome. I don’t criticize your choice at all, for me it just doesn’t feel right, at least right now. Thanks for reading, throw some knowledge at me!	ankylosingspondylitis
ELI5: Why hadn't Ebola spread to the US a long time ago?	All it takes is for one infected person to get to the United States for it to spread, right? I'm surprised it took this long. I know there's restrictions on where you can fly if you have certain diseases, but you'd think somebody would be undiagnosed or simply break the law and fly to the US without telling anyone they have Ebola, right?	explainlikeimfive
Structural Violence: Living with an Undiagnosed Illness for 10 Years	"**Disclaimer** Alright, so I found Reddit by chance a few weeks ago, and I've been reading through posts and getting a feel for the site. After some time, I felt compelled to share my story, but I was hesitant. I needed to make sure that Redditors are respectful, open-minded, and supportive. Thankfully, I have seen that most of you are. In order for me to share my story, I need that safety net to be in place. I usually choose not to share my story, because I have found that I can't trust people with it - not even my own family members. All they do is minimize, hurt, and judge. But Redditors, it seems, are not that way. So . . . cloaked in the safety of my (sort of) anonymity, I need to tell my story. I just really need people to not be judgmental, and I am begging all of you to understand that I am not trying to impose or be a leech toward anyone I have ever encountered. I am in no way an entitled person. I need to know that this is a safe place for me to tell this story. Please do not make me regret it. This is my very first Reddit post, and I've reviewed the forum and site rules as well as the Reddiquette. I'm really going to try to adhere to them, and I'm really going to try really hard to compile this massive story into a worthwhile, coherent read. I also feel that I really need to link to just one article I wrote, just this once, but only because it is very relevant to the story, and it explains this story well. There are honestly a LOT of links I'd like to include, because they, too are relevant and helpful to the story. But I won't, because I don't want to mess this up. Anyway, I just really hope I do this right. So here goes. And thanks to everyone who reads it all. **The Background Information** To give a bit of a background, I am someone with an undiagnosed illness. Essentially, what that means is that I have a mysterious illness that has defied answers. There IS an illness there, and I really AM sick. It's NOT a psychosomatic illness or a mental condition such as Munchausen's, Hypochodriasis, depression, or anxiety. There is truly something wrong with me, and after dozens of tests, no one has a diagnosis. There is no single occurrence that makes a disease undiagnosed. Sometimes the disease is rare, sometimes the symptoms mimic other ailments, and sometimes, people have diseases that have no name. As in, literally, there is not a doctor anywhere at any time that has officially established and defined that disease. And sometimes, unfortunately, the doctor just doesn't have the answer. If you've ever seen the show Mystery Diagnosis, you might get a very basic, brief idea of what I have been through in the last 10 years. **The Crash Course** It is at this point in the post that I need to include a link. I, just this once, want to include it because it provides a really thorough context. I honestly don't know how to complete this post without it. It's an article I wrote and published about this very experience and how it has affected me. I am in no way attempting, intentionally or otherwise, to spam anyone. Once you read everything together, you'll see what I mean. It all just kind of fits together. This article will support my position that I am in a difficult situation, and that I did not create any of it. When I was born, the atmosphere just opened up, and the most foul-smelling, rancid, festering river of Fuck You rained down on me continuously, while everyone around me blamed me for not having an umbrella. I'm nearly drowning, and almost everyone around me has pushed me farther under. So please, even though it's technically a no-no, please read [the article](http://www.examiner.com/review/crowdmed-offers-hope-for-the-undiagnosed) before continuing. **The Story** Living without a diagnosis has forced me to relinquish all control of my own life. I simply have almost no control over my life anymore, and there isn't a damned thing I can do about it. I have an illness that has made me sick enough to the point that supporting myself financially is not possible. I tried so hard to be that independent, accomplished person. For so long, I tried until I nearly collapsed. Physically and mentally, I cannot even sit at a desk for 8 hours a day and use a computer. It hurts me knowing that I can't. I'm kind of getting choked up just thinking about it. I want to so badly. More than anything, I want to. But I can't. I just don't have the bodily resources to sustain it. So, because of that, I have no money. I have no bank account, no savings, no assets. My credit is now shot. I am grateful for every last tiny thing in my life that is positive and beneficial. I count my blessings. At the same time, I am in need. When you have no money, you can't afford to live on your own or pay any bills. That makes it very difficult to avoid homelessness. I have narrowly avoided it, I have come very close on more than one occasion. All I can really do is move again and again, from house to house, over and over. But, understandably so, people get tired of me. Despite me trying absolutely everything to improve my circumstances, no lead ever pans out. Nothing ever works. People get (understandably) tired of supporting me, and once again, I have to pack up all my stuff and find somewhere to live with no money and no way of acquiring any. I have lost count of how many times I have had to move in the last 3 or 4 years. The thing is, I totally get it. No one can live for free. It's crystal clear, I promise all of you. And I have tried absolutely everything to change my circumstances. You might be wondering why I can't just move back home. My mother and her boyfriend have drinking problems, and it gets violent. I actually HAVE lived there before, and while it was better than being homeless, it was no picnic. I woke up terrified of his wrath, went to bed terrified of his wrath, and sobbed almost daily. He once threatened to shoot me, and during another incident, he hit and almost choked me. My mother doesn't do anything about it. The last time I lived there, I lost the will to live. I planned on overdosing on pain pills, but couldn't find any. So here I am. I have lived with other people as well, and while it was marginally better (and while I appreciate all hospitality, always), things did not improve. I was constantly harassed, chastized, and verbally abused because they couldn't deal with my circumstances. These were all people that I had known for years. I cried so many tears over all of this. It was this never-ending rain that never stopped. All I could do was continue to move forward and try to fix my life. Even as I sit here now, all I can do is shake my head, because I can't wrap my mind around my own experience. I truly do not understand how . . . why . . . this dragged on for so long and in such futility. Every idea, every new lead, every possibility, every option - I tried it all. Nothing was working. I hit a road block every single time. Try and fail, try and fail, try and fail. All while battling near-homelessness, constant abuse, and how I was going to afford to buy basic toiletries. Part of what compounded the issue is that I do not qualify for any kind of health insurance. Nothing from the Health Insurance Marketplace (""ObamaCare""), no indigent care, no Medicaid, nothing. Even with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, each state gets to decide whether or not to expand Medicaid. Governor Deal, the governor of my state, chose not to. When elections rolled around, people elected him for a second term, dashing my hopes once again. And the Affordable Care Act uses money from your tax return to get reduced insurance rates. Thanks to my stupid illness, I can't work, so that option is out. And with no diagnosis, I don't qualify for disability, either. There is literally nothing I can do to fix my situation. I have been completely abandoned by almost everyone in my life because of this, including my own family and some of my extended family. They all think I just need to ""get it together."" In fact, my extended family had a ""meeting"" behind my back and decided they would force me to exercise, because they were so sure that they knew how to ""fix"" my illness. So yeah. I apparently shouldn't have confided in them that I wasn't feeling well, and that is the last time I will ever trust them with anything ever again. I actually WOULD like advice as to what I can do to fix all of this. But I beg of you, proceed carefully. While I will always appreciate help, there are some things that simply won't work, and I am going to ask that you avoid saying the following suggestions, as they are extremely minimizing and hurtful. And I can assure you, I have heard and tried them all: 1. Try eating a healthier diet. 2. It's all in your head. 3. You're obviously just exaggerating or faking it. 4. It would help if you exercise more. 5. Try getting out of the house more. 6. It would help if you had a better attitude. 7. It's just mind over matter. 8. Other people have it worse. You just need to suck it up. 9. Try THIS supplement! It worked for [whoever]. 10. You just need to get a job and stop being lazy! 11. Just pray more. 12. Just try coffee or energy drinks! 13. Other people have it worse! 14. Just tough it out. 15. It's mind over matter! 16. Everybody gets tired. It's not that big of a deal. 17. Just go to a clinic or walk into an ER. Essentially, I am asking you all to tactfuly help me fix my *circumstances*, **not** the illness. At this point, I am trying ONE last idea, and then I will be flat out of options. There is a local doctor's office near me that accepts reduced rates. I can save up for the $45 fee by doing small side jobs here and there as my health permits. I am still in the process of gathering some documentation. If this place cannot diagnose me, it will not be good. I am never one to be dramatic, but people have died in the past because they could not get a diagnosis. I don't want the same thing to happen to me. I am not just some lazy, entitled mooch who refuses to get off her ass and work. I am not someone who sits around and whines and complains while never trying to better herself. That's not me. It never has been, and it never will be. I have lost control of my life due to problems in my life for which there is seemingly no solution. I am 31 years old, and while I am alive, I have not yet begin to live. I am merely existing. At the beginning of last year, the people I was last living with just got tired of me and kicked me out in favor of a paying tenant. I understand why they did it, but they knew full and well what I was going through. I had been keeping my mom updated all along in case I had to move back home. Throughout all of this, she assured me that I could come back home. When the day finally arrived and I had to move yet again, my mother changed her mind and, despite having a spare bed, refused to let me come home. For several tearful moments, I tried to figure out what I was going to do. I imagined a life of wandering through Wal-Marts and hospitals, taking ""sink baths"" every night in the bathrooms. Could I live in a bus station? Would I be raped? Where would I stash my stuff? At the last minute, I remembered a friend from college. She and her husband lived about 2.5 hours away. She knew of my circumstances and once offered me a room should I ever need it. I had forgotten about it until then. I contacted her and let her know what was going on. She and her husband immediately sprang into action, driving all that way to come pick me up. I have bee with them ever since. The change was abrupt, but it was the best thing that has ever happened to me. We have become a little family. They accept me, trust that I am doing the best I can, and show me what it means to be around people who are caring and understanding. I can count on one hand the number of times in my 31 years that I have NOT been rejected, and this is one of them. They just allow me to be sick. It feels like breathing for the first time. They insist that I can stay as long as I need to. I am so relieved and so thankful, and it is so healing every single day. Now that I have a stable place to live, I can focus a little more on trying to accommodate my illness and trying to figure out how to fix this. But I am running out of options. if this local doctor's office rejects me or is unable to diagnose me, I will be officially out of options. Once that happens, all I will be able to do is wait it out while I succumb to a demon that no one can identify. I did not ask to be sick. I did not cause it. I have not done anything to make it worse. I have this insurmountable, unfathomable problem with no solution. No end in sight. Everyone who has the ability to help simply refuses to do so. As for everyone else, all they can do is say ""I'm sorry."" I know this is impossibly long, and thank you to those who read it in its entirely. This really isn't even the whole story. I could go on for pages about how this mystery disease has affected me mentally and physically. How debilitating it is. How frustrating it is. I am not in a wheelchair, nor do I use mobility devices. But I have been tempted before. At this point, I understand what I can and can't do, and I pace myself as needed. That's all I *can* do, really. I can't make my illness work around my life. I have to make my life work around my illness. tl;dr: I've always been sick. No one believes me, and no one knows why. I have no way of finding out. It has completely halted my life. I don't know what to do, and I need help."	offmychest
Less pain while pregnant	Hi ladies, prior to getting pregnant I suffered from mid/moderate chronic pain. Primarily in my back, shoulders and neck, sometimes in my hands, hips and knees. But since getting pregnant, the pain has almost gone away. I feel for you ladies having back pain, I can totally sympathize with how that feels, but i'm very grateful that so far, my pregnancy has been pain free. My pain is currently undiagnosed. I've been tested for RA a few times, and have had some thyroid tests done as well. Both would be for an autoimmune disease. I know that pregnancy suppresses your immune system, but in the small amount of research I've done on autoimmune disease and pregnancy, there isn't a clear tie between this reducing symptoms. Some people, especially those with RA, seem to experience more pain. So for any ladies out there who suffer from chronic pain, did you have a similar experience? Might I be on to something here?

Pain decreased with pregnancy	Prior to getting pregnant I suffered from mid/moderate chronic pain. Primarily in my back, shoulders and neck, sometimes in my hands, hips and knees. But since getting pregnant, the pain has almost gone away. I thought that maybe it was all mental- that I was just focusing on other things and thus, not noticing the pain, but then, I realized something and I wanted to check in with you to see if I may be onto something here. My pain is currently undiagnosed. I've been tested for RA a few times, and have had some thyroid tests done as well. Both would be for an autoimmune disease. This morning, as I lamented being sick AGAIN I had an epiphany. Pregnancy suppresses your immune system, could it also be suppressing my symptoms? In the small amount of research I've done on autoimmune disease and pregnancy, there isn't a clear tie between reduced symptoms. Some people, especially those with RA, seem to experience more pain. But others do have less pain. Does anyone else have experience with decreased pain from pregnancy? Could it be from my suppressed immune system, or maybe something else, like increased hormones?

Grad Student Loan Repayment with a Twist	Hello, Thank you all who post here for your thoughtful and helpful advice. As a smart young woman, with a whole lot of debt but a good head on my shoulders, I seek your advice today. I have great deal of student loan debt following grad school. Before grad school, I made a great salary for my age, but in a role with limited growth. I assumed I would be able to limit costs by working a lot during school, even while having one incredibly demanding, time-consuming chronic disease. Then those plans were shot when I came down with epilepsy. Which was undiagnosed until the end of grad school, but put a major damper on my ability to perform beyond my already demanding program requirements. For several months after school, I was not earning income above survival level, so remained in forbearance. Once properly tested and treated, I got a great salaried job. However, my school was expensive. For the numbers, my options, as far as I can see, are: 1. Pay down debt for 10 years at $1650 per month. 2. Enter an IBR program and invest to prepare for the tax bill in 25 years. I would love to pursue option one, but given my medical costs outside of insurance (par for the course with the conditions I have), I cannot do that unless I ask for significant family assistance. I do not want to be an extra burden to family members, even though some have suggested there is a way to set up a repayment plan to them at a lower interest rate than my loans. If I enter IBR, I understand that I could theoretically have my outstanding loan amount forgiven in 25 years but expect to pay tax on that amount. This option seems reasonable, so long as I can save and invest in preparation for the tax bill that year. My chief questions at this moment are (with the caveat that I seek human intelligence and have reviewed as many online resources as possible in addition to speaking with financial services and my loan servicer at this point): If I enter an IBR program, am I able to pay more than the monthly payment without penalty when I am able? If I enter an IBR program and my income increases significantly, will I stop qualifying, or encounter other downsides? How do I calculate AGI when my salaried position began in August of 2014? What can I do with any money I can set aside to invest in preparation for the tax bill in 25 years if I remain on IBR? If my income increases so that I stop qualifying for IBR, what consequences can I expect? Thank you for your help. I hope to post words of wisdom here when my path forward is clear.	personalfinance
[Serious] I do not qualify for any kind of health insurance, and I am too sick to work. How can I get my rare disease diagnosed?	"This is my first time posting on this subreddit, and only my second time posting to Reddit at all. So I've read the sidebar rules, and I just really hope that this post is okay and that I do everything right. The [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2rv0ib/structural_violence_living_with_an_undiagnosed/) is really, obscenely long, but I hope someone out there has the patience to read it in full. It's important to read everything, though, because I go into a lot of detail about everything I have tried in an attempt to get myself ""unstuck."" I just don't want someone to suggest something, only for me to say, ""I've already tried that,"" and that someone thinks I'm intentionally rejecting his or her advice. Thank you to all who read."	medical
chronic pain and undiagnosed autoimmune disease	I worked for over 20 yrs. as a social worker, and was in good health for most of the time with the exception of the last year. In 2002 - Diagnosed with hyperplasia of uterus, 2003 - Pulmonary Embolism which caused scaring and death in lower lobe of left lung, 2004 - partial hysterectomy, 2008 - Raynauds Syndrome - effecting my digits and now affect other parts of my body and episodes can last for 24hrs - I live in VT and experience painful raynauds in both summer and winter months, 2011 - Pericarditis and abnormal EKG admitted to ICU for 4 days, 3 episodes of Pericarditis since first episode - Cardiologist believed Pericarditis was a secondary illness which he said likely an autoimmune disorder, referred to Rheumatologist multiple blood tests and none indicated any autoimmune disease, but she treated me with Plaquinel for over 2 years, Rheumatologist referred to Neurologist - MRI showed lesions that were not typical for a person my age, and although lumbar puncture did not indicate MS the Neurologist stated she was not going to rule out MS or some other dymelating disease, during past 2 1/2 years have experience extreme joint and bone pain, urine retention, mental confusion, muscle weakness, rash on abdominal area for 2 years that 2 determatologist could not diagnose, 6 weeks ago admitted to hospital for renal disease..... I am at the very end of my rope and feel like a sitting duck.... during renal incident doctor discovered in 2005 and 2006 my ANA's were positive for autoimmune which was never shared with me. I consider ending my life every day I am so tired of living in excruitating bone and joint pain and wondering what is next... I need some control.	autoimmunity
10 years later still undiagnosed. Scleredema? Morphea? Wtf is eosinophilic fasciitis?	"I went through a crazy amount of testing 10 years ago when I was 18 years old, but nothing has been formally diagnosed. Best answer is ""a mixed disease of panscloratic morphea and scleredema"". Now 10 years later, I'm still deformed, and unsure what the future holds for my stupid rare disease. I was sent to another dermatologist 2 years ago, and she without testing said ""its Morphea, you're fine"". Great. How do you know that without testing me? Do I have to see multiple dermatologist until I find someone who gives a shit to test me again and properly diagnose me? Or do I carry on with life until it potentially grows and affects my mobility? Or worse, starts hitting my internal organs? If you don't know what it is, how do you know what it could potentially do? Would you be concerned and push for answers? I've added some notes from my old dermatologist. One of his brain storming map, another is a report that was given to other dermatologists for a doctor's round to try to figure it out. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

[Request] experiences and recommendations for approaching the subject with a SO with [undiagnosed, but apparent] bipolar disorder.	"I'm currently in a situation with my SO where some form of bipolar disorder seems to fit all the criteria for her current mental state. She is 25, with history of Bipolar disorder on both sides of her family and an older sibling with a confirmed diagnosis, on top of that, she has somewhat self diagnosed, become aware, convinced, and/or accepted that she might be bipolar. The past couple months have seen the first ""major"" manifestations of the disorder following a major and recurring depression with a ""persuasively voluntary"" admission to an inpatient mental health facility this summer. Without going into too much detail, her mother committed suicide when she was 16 as a result of [undiagnosed] bipolar disorder and her father died of Huntington's disease about a year later, so needless to say a tumultuous adolescence. Thank Christ though, she only has had passive suicidal thoughts on her downs; and a very robust, but a markedly taxed and slowly exhausting, support system which I believe has prevented her from engaging in the more harmful and destructive aspects of the disorder. She is currently under care with a great Nurse Practitioner, and a counsellor who seems good but has a particularly heavy client load and hasn't been privy to all the information needed I believe and can't formally give a differential as they are currently pursuing their full accreditation in psychology. All that being said, and from experience, what is the prudent course of action? Should I directly and discreetly contact her health care providers with my concerns or gently and tactfully bring the subject up with my SO. Any input is greatly appreciated; for all the emotional stoutness and crisis management skills coupled with the patience of saint I have, dealing with major mental issues and their nuances is not something I've got in my skill set."

Dieting with Hashimoto's, lost 40lbs, on a complete standstill with BMI at 31... Some questions for you all before my next check up.	"I found out I had Hashimoto's disease in April 2014, after a twin pregnancy. I learned I went undiagnosed for 10 years. It felt like a huge revelation. I started a very strict diet in May, of 1000-1200kcal per day. Low, but allowable given my height is only 5'3"". My Endo gave the go ahead. I used myfitnesspal rigorously, used a whitings scale to keep track of my intake, and calculated my TDEE. I managed to lose 45lbs by September (BMI 40 -&gt; 31). Right in time for another check up. I was extremely proud! For the first time in ten years, I lost weight! Pre-pregnancy I was very active (badminton, running...), but it never helped to manage my weight. But near the end of the summer, my weight loss slowed viciously. It finally stopped completely in October. At that point, my endo ordered me to up my calorie intake to 1500kcal since she thought my BMI was at a decent level (30-31). Weight loss would be substantially slower, but I figured there'd still be weightloss. Sadly, my weight loss stopped entirely as soon as I did so. I weighed in every 2 weeks, and everytime I would cry: I didn't lose a single pound. Worse, I even gained a little (about 5lbs). Now my weight is stable again, but not dropping at all. I can think of reasons why this might be happening, but I don't understand why it's lasting so long. And worse of all: I don't understand why my weightloss is halting at this weight. With my TDEE and food intake I could sustain a body that weighs 40 lbs less! Or at least a body that weighs 20 lbs less! My fatigue has become substantially worse since my last check up, which was in September 2014. My muscle and joint pain is unbearable as well. I'm guessing my thyroid is in bad shape again, and I need another checkup and dose adjustment. I made an appointment during my last appointment for late January (earliest available) so I'm due for my check up very soon. **But before I go, I'd like to ask some questions:** Has anyone ever had a similar problem? Weight loss that just halted at a certain weight, even though your calorie intake is very moderate? Or weight gain when another dose adjustment was necessary again? I know this can happen when your thyroid is further deteriorating, and when you need a higher dose of medication, but can this happen so fast? Is 25mcg such a big difference? The last couple of weeks I've had extreme constipation, muscle pain, brain fogg, hair loss, forgetfullness and my throat has been sore for weeks. Do these symptoms resurface again for others again too, or are you without symptoms once your treatment is less or more stable? My symptoms seem to come and go, in bad ups and downs. Has anyone got any metabolism problems? My endo says a person with Hashimoto's should eat -300kcal than recommended to maintain a normal weight, compared to a person without hashimoto's. How many with hashimoto's here feel like they have regained a normal and stable life without symptoms? How long did it take? My husband and children are all at a very healthy weight (BMI 18-22) and we eat the same things. So any advice to conquer this problem is very welcome. **Some extra information:** - I'm on 100mcg levothyroxine - No supplements of any kind - Endo stopped vitamin B supplements (Oral) as soon as I hit normal levels. - Endo stopped vitamin D supplements as soon as I hit normal levels."

Mother of 3 with Hashimoto's disease and a busy life: Experience of other parents transitioning to Keto?	"I'm a mother of 3 sweet boys under 3 years old. I work fulltime from home as an illustrator. I have a busy lifestyle, since my children are at home with me during the day, which means I have very long workdays. Sadly I've been diagnosed as a Hashimoto's patient after my last pregnancy. Records finally showed I had gone undiagnosed for at least 10 years. My symptoms are still very severe. I've lost 40lbs on an intermittent fasting diet, but my weight loss has come to a halt... I was looking into Keto to break my plateau, and am struggling with a few practical questions, and was hoping for some insight and feedback from people who faces similar problems before. - How bad is the ""Keto-fever"", when you start the Keto diet? Due to hashimoto's I'm constantly without energy, and have severe concentration problems. I'm scared to start Keto and 'make things worse', even if it's just for a few weeks... - Has the keto diet helped fellow thyroid patients with alleviating some of the symptoms, or at least, manage the weight problem? - If you live in a household with persons who depend on you, and do not need to follow the Keto diet, how do you work around this? I cook for my husband and children, who are all at a very healthy weight. How can I easily follow the Keto-diet myself whilst still providing for them? - What happens when you have high carb cheat days? (Few times per year I'm required to go out on a business trip lasting several days. Food choices are set by others, and due to hierarchic reasons, best not interfered with.) - Any parents who followed a keto diet together? - How difficult was it for you to switch to a keto diet? I'm hoping to receive some feedback, as I'm really interested to start keto, but scared at the same time. I'm short on time, but am reading as much as I can about the diet, and will be looking up recipes shortly. Any tips and experiences are very welcome! I'd like to regain control of my body and life."	keto

ELI5: What is the cause of the uprising of autism within the last 10-15 years?	So maybe I'm misinformed but it seems that Autism has been becoming more prevalent within the last 10-15 years when I went to school it was uncommon now it seems everyone knows someone with it. Is it a change in our genetics or DNA or has the issue always been there just undiagnosed or is it an over diagnosed disease type?	explainlikeimfive

Low red cell count?	Really hoping for some advice here please. I have undiagnosed bowel problems that are very likely celiac disease (diagnosis is ongoing). In July last year I was suffering from heart palpitations, numbness and more and was diagnosed with folate deficiency and borderline B12 deficiency. I was told my MCV was too high. I was retested in December and the problem was found to be corrected (MCV went 101.5 - 87.5, and B12 / folate were very good) - I was feeling good at this point. A few months later and I'm struggling with tiredness and random spells of feeling feint. I had a full blood cell count which found my red blood cell count is off (4.39 in a range of 4.5 - 5.5) and also haematocrit but subsequently my iron levels are fine and my MCV is still fine so B12 / folate is not suspected again. My doctor shrugged and said it was probably normal for me and the feintness is anxiety? Any suggestions?	AskDocs
I [22M] am moving a long distance and broke up with my gf [24f] of 8 months. She suffers from chronic pain and I could not have left at a worse time. Things are getting complicated. What do I do?	I'll put things in chronological order as best as I can. My girlfriend has had chronic pain issues since I've known her. For quite some time she suspected it was Crohn's disease or something similar for a long time. She went in for a colonoscopy last week but the doctors didn't find anything wrong with her. Needless to say she was extremely upset that she is still undiagnosed. She can't work at the moment but isn't getting any medical treatment either. It's a very bad situation. The very next day I got a call from a radio station that I had been shortlisted for a job at. They're hiring me! This is the first real career job for me. I'll be moving out of my parents' house in a few days, be earning a decent salary and be well on my way to an adult life. I'm thrilled! However, there's a catch. This radio job is over 800 miles away. The two of us had a chat that night about what we were going to do. She wanted to continue a long distance relationship. I did not. We didn't really discuss what we were going to do in this situation beforehand when we really should have. I take responsibility for that. She completely broke down. I can't remember the last time I saw someone cry that much. I was sad with the situation and felt awful having hurt her like that, but she was completely distraught. She didn't want to talk to me ever again at that point, so I texted her mom after I left to make sure someone knew what was going on and could help her. She's seeing a therapist, who I called a few days later to let know what was going on as well. A couple days later she called me to come over and air a few things out. She was still crying a lot and wanted me to know how badly I hurt her. She needed me more than ever and felt stabbed in the back. I can't really blame her for feeling that way. Today she texted me saying she changed her mind about breaking off contact. She said basically I was her boyfriend but I was also her best friend and she can't afford to lose both. We've texted back and forth a bit since. As you can see things are getting a bit muddy. I feel tremendously guilty about leaving her at such a critical time and am starting to think shooting down the long distance idea was a mistake. However, I don't think I should tell her that. Going back on my decision. would be playing even more games with her heart and wouldn't be fair to her at all. What concerns me even more though is I might not be able to handle the amount of emotional dependence she has on me. She has a couple friends, but not many. She can't really go out much with her ailments either so she basically sits and watches TV most of the day. She's had an absolutely miserable past year or so and I feel for her on that, but from what I can tell I was becoming the only source of happiness in her life. I don't know if I can get back with her if her whole emotional well being depends on our relationship. I have my doubts that's ultimately all that good for her either. What do I do? I honestly have no idea. Should I backtrack and take up long distance? Should I continue to talk to her or would it be better for her if I just broke things off completely? --- **tl;dr**: Girlfriend is sick with chronic pain issues. I found out I was moving 800 miles for a job the day after she had an inconclusive medical procedure. I didn't want to continue things long distance and she's been a wreck since. We're texting again now. Should I keep contact? Should I stay firm with ending the relationship?	relationships

Looking for a dermatologist to take on my special case.	"Hi, I'm looking to talk to a dermatologist, or someone who has access to communication with dermatologists. I'm specifically looking for a dermatologist that is willing to take on my special case, which is a rarer than rare skin disease that is apparently some hybrid of two rare skin diseases. One doctors comments: ""This is an unusual presentation of Scleredema. None of the usual etiologies i.e streptococcal infection, diabetes, or paraproteinaemia are present. Clinically, the diagnosis was more compatible with pansclerotic morphea or eosinophilic fasciitis. The pathology is not compatible with either. She does have mild eosinophilia but the MRI was negative."" 10 years ago, I went through extensive testing, MIR's, biopsies, doctors rounds, and I am still left undiagnosed. I'm pursuing it again now because it seems to be changing, effecting my movement, and aching, as opposed to being simply cosmetic like when first investigated. My family doctor will refer me to anyone willing to dig into this. Any help or advice greatly appreciated! edit: My family doctor referred me to the first dermatologist who did all the initial testing, then he gave up.. and then 2 years ago she referred me to another, ""one of the best in Ottawa"" but when the appointment came around, I was booked with another dermatologist in the office, and brushed off with ""its just morphea"". At that time I didn't have the paper work from the original dermatologist to prove that my case was unique and that it wasn't just morphea. She ordered blood tests to make sure it wasnt affecting my internal organs. I don't think my doctor knows who else to refer me to, and I'm afraid of just being brushed off again if I get randomly assigned to another dermatologist. I want to find someone who is up for the challenge and willing to take on my case!"	ottawa
I don't want to vaccinate, and I'm pro vaccination	First of all, I'm not an anti vaxxer. My daughter is just over 3 months old and going for her vaccinations the day after tomorrow. But the closer that day gets, the more I start to freak out. This ain't my first kid, I have a 6 year old son who has had all of his vaccinations. I got my mother in law to take him to get them as I just couldn't handle seeing someone give my boy a needle, but he got them. I had severe undiagnosed PPD with my son, it lasted for just over a year and while I loved my son, I wasn't quite as attached as most mums are. This time around, I have PPD but am on medication for it that really helps. My daughter is the greatest thing in the world, I just adore her so much. I want nothing but the best for her but I am seriously considering cancelling her appointment for her needles because I just can't stand the thought of someone hurting her. I've even organised my mother in law to take her, but I'm freaking out. All I can think about is that she won't understand why people are hurting her. Needles hurt, anyone who says they don't is a liar. My son was vaccinated, why can't I get my head around my daughter getting vaccinated? Is there some sort of numbing agent they could put on her skin so that the needles don't hurt her? I'm in tears writing this. I KNOW she needs her needles. I don't want to risk her getting some deadly disease. But I'm panicking, I can't handle it. I don't want anyone to stick needles in my little girl. Has anyone else felt like this? I am seriously freaking the f**** out.	beyondthebump
My thoughts on a lifetime of severe anxiety &amp; my cure	"I'll try to keep this short, but it's going to get long. TL;DR up front: I believe that the majority of recurring anxiety &amp; panic attacks are caused by food (which requires further explanation, see below). But first, some history: I struggled with constant anxiety &amp; regular panic attacks most of my life, and depression later in my life, as well as borderline hypochrondriac because I'd have minor annoying problems (light IBS, . I eventually turned into as much of a hermit as life would allow, keeping to the same routine because doing new things in new places was extremely difficult. About 10 years ago, I discovered that I had undiagnosed food allergies, which directly caused my anxiety &amp; panic attacks. As I've met others IRL &amp; online with this root cause, I've come to believe that the vast majority of people suffering from anxiety &amp; panic attacks have undiagnosed food allergies. To clarify, I do not believe that ALL anxiety is caused by food. A short laundry list: 1. Most people (aside from most overconfident Type-A people) suffer some anxiety from time to time, that's normal 2. Some people have strong anxiety - separation anxiety from their SO, anxiety about specific things like school or pregnancy, and so on 3. Some people have PSTD from war, accidents, trauma, abuse, etc. 4. Some people have damage from injuries, drugs, etc. 5. Some people have severe mental disorders (bipolar etc.), many of which NEED to be treated by drugs 6. But most people, IME, have food-driven anxiety, and are not aware of the connection between food &amp; how they feel This is just my opinion, but if you suffer from anxiety &amp; are willing to dig into finding a permanent way out, hear me out. In a nutshell, food reactions are not limited to going into anaphylactic shock, or having a skin rash or hives, or having swollen lips. It can also cause emotional problems like anxiety &amp; panic attacks. Here's a simplified explanation: when you eat foods that you are, shall we say, ""emotionally allergic"" to (to coin a phrase), the ingestion of the food cause a variety of reactions, which typically include: 1. Sleeping problems 2. ""Brain fog"", ADHD, and fatigue - trouble focusing, trouble thinking clearly, trouble thinking past the emotional reaction you feel to deal with different situations 3. Anxiety. Best description is like when someone scares you or makes you jump, like when an animal runs in front of your car, or the sense of dread you get when you get called into the boss's office or HR, or the principle's office. 4. Along with the anxiety &amp; feeling of dread, feeling bad all the time, feeling wrong. Having negative emotions stick with you &amp; not being able to shake them - thinking about the negative things over &amp; over again. Feeling bad a lot. 5. Panic attacks - a rollercoaster ride that gives you sweaty palms, a feeling of hotness, your heart beating fast, and for me, just feeling like I was warping into another dimension. Horrible. To date, still the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life. It go to the point where I was having them multiple times a day. 5. Emotionally bananas. Usually you can control how you feel, but sometimes you just can't get rid of the negative feelings as mentioned above. Just lots of weird, random emotional weirdness that you don't have control over. Instead of you breathing out, it's more like the wind rolling over you - you don't always have a choice with how you feel or react emotionally to different thoughts &amp; situations. And all of this can be both location &amp; situation-based, like going out in public or to a new place you've never been before, or a crowded place, or anywhere you just don't feel comfortable, or can be thought-based, like thinking about going to a busy place, like wandering around busy school halls. The easiest comparison is food vs. batteries. When you plug batteries in, they power something like a flashlight until the juice dies. When you eat foods that you're emotionally allergic to, they cause reactions until it exits your body (and in some cases, the effects can last longer than that, especially if you have a physically-tied allergic like Celiac's disease - in my case, I feel better after the food exits my body after a few days). There is a ridiculous ton of information out there about these connections...if you know where to look. I came across it by accident &amp; it changed my life. Once I knew the keyword to look for - food allergies - I was able to overcome my problems. I now live a completely normal life. Sure, I have the normal everyday anxieties that everyone has, but it's not emotionally crippling &amp; doesn't stop me from living like a regular person. It's not like before, when home was my ""safe zone"" &amp; other places outside weren't. I never really got panic attacks at home, although the anxiety, especially the emotional feelings of feeling bad about stuff, were there. An easy way to tell if you suffer the food allergy root cause is if your anxiety isn't 24/7. Do you feel better when you're safe &amp; secure at home? Or with friends, who provide a safety net? Or going to work where you at least feel comfortable enough to function to some degree? Those routines provide a foundation for the anxiety. If you were constantly anxious ALL the time, it would be difficult to ever function at all, so sometimes you have downtime at home, like when you can unplug &amp; surf the net and get away from things for awhile - away from yourself for awhile. I did everything in my power to fix my anxiety. I saw therapists. Boy was that expensive! I did research online. I tried medication (which kind of helped, but not really - crappy side effects, and never really solved the problem, and of course you have to keep amping up the doses to get the same effect over time). Exercise was hard because I was always so tired. I was always so tired because I didn't have the willpower to go to bed at a decent hour, and even when I did, I had trouble falling asleep &amp; staying asleep. I never woke up refreshed, I woke up groggy - that's a HUGE sign of food allergies - your brain should be awake &amp; alert the moment you wake up, otherwise your diet is not right! Naps never made me feel great either, in general. So back to the point - you eat food you're emotionally allergic to, it stays in your body as a battery powering the anxiety flashlight, and eventually exists. But you have to eat every day, and a lot of times you get semi-addicted to what your body can't absorb, so that's one thing to look out for. For example, dairy causes panic attacks for me. I drank milk more than water. Always had a candy bar every day. Stuff like that. You get kind of a high when your body reacts to food, the defenses it sends in to deal with the food allergen also give you a stimulation - not something you really notice physically, but for a lot of people, eating their food allergies makes them feel a bit better for a period of time, so they always have to have it. It's kind of like self-medicating, but it creates a viscous cycle that emotionally cripples you through feeling bad &amp; having anxiety. This isn't something I generally talk about or share with people, outside of allergy support groups, so I apologize for rambling. As far as the food goes, it can be anything. There are eight common ones, stuff like dairy &amp; soy &amp; gluten, but there are also ones that are far more hidden, like corn. Corn exists in most off-the-shelf food, even salt, as an additive or preservative or natural flavor. A lot of people with a corn allergy or a gluten allergy suffer from mood swings, anxiety, feeling bad (I call it ""sticky bad"", when you can't get rid of thinking about something dumb you did or feel bad about something, especially something minor like not waving someone through a stop sign and then you feel like crap about it for hours, which is ludicrous!). What people who don't have anxiety don't understand, and even a lot of people who do have anxiety, is that it's an external force. It's not you choosing to have it: again, it's like the wind, or waves washing over you. I call it my anxiety motor. When I ingest something I'm allergy to, it starts the motor up &amp; starts the gears for feeling bad, feeling anxiety, having panic attacks, the works. And since you're constantly eating, and a lot of foods are in everything (milk, corn, and wheat especially are in EVERYTHING packaged), that motor just keeps running all the time - so instead of the anxiety being full-blown 24/7, you feel better at home, and you also have better days (and worse days), it's not always perfectly consistent, which is based on the amount of foods you ingest that you're allergic to. You can also be allergic to groups of stuff. Grains in general (the grass family) are a growing allergy. I kept reading study after study saying that sugar doesn't make kids bonkers &amp; writing that off because kids always go nuts on sugar, but as I paid attention to it, I realized that only some kids go bananas when they have sugar - they get crazy energy, they have mood swings, they have a high &amp; a low, they lose their ability to focus &amp; go into ADHD mode - for a lot of those kids, they have an undiagnosed grains allergy, which sugarcane is a party of. So if you give them a Twinkie which is loaded up with corn syrup, sugarcane, wheat gluten, and all that, then it's an emotional time bomb for them. But then I see people all the time eating them without any kind of reaction other than ""well that was yummy"". part 1/2"	Anxiety
On my wits end. Can this be signs of a systemic disease? Hard to find good vets here... Please help.	Species: Cat Age: 1.5 Sex/Neuter status: Male, neutered A quick summary: Rescued stray cat, gotten from the streets when he was a few days old (was abandoned litter). Never seen his mom, bottle fed. Strictly indoors cat since that day. This December we decided it was time for him to get neutered. He was yowling a lot. He was a healthy happy cat. Neutering went great. He was put on antibiotics for a week just in case. All was fine. 3 weeks after neutering, we started to see scarring around his eyes (fur area). Upon closer investigation, it became clear that the area was generally in a reddish tint, and whenever he tried to scratch the area it bled and caused scarring. Took him to the vet. He did just visual inspection, told it was either allergies or fungus (ringworm). Got him on a hypoallergenic diet, got an anti-ring worm vaccine (inactive microsporium canis) and started wearing e-collar. Vet said it would probably improve within 10 days. He wore the e-collar for 10 days. And although his scars healed, the area was still sensitive as day 1. Whenever he touched the area, it bled. Got him to another vet upon recommendation and gave him the story. He again did visual inspection and looked at him with black light. Said there was no sign of a fungal infection and this was definitely allergies. He gave him 3 different shots (I don't know what they were) and said he'd definitely improve and would be good as new in a week. And the cat really started getting better immediately. The new scars healed, no redness, no sensitivity. I was happy! But after a week, I started seeing redness around his ears. Took him back to the vet. Again, black light inspection. This time the thing in his ears were definitely ringworms. He gave him another shot and I don't know what it was. And gave us anti-fungal spray for his ears to be applied once a day. And anti fungal spray works. The ear problem is close to gone. But since the last vet visit, the cat just looks unhappy. Sleeps all day. Plays games when we play with him but very unenthusiastically. He eats and drinks well, but his good spirits are gone. And again since the last vet visit, he has been sneezing, only when he is awake, 10-20 times a day. There isn't much mucus. Only some droplets. They are not green or very slimy. He doesn't look sick or disoriented. Just disinterested. Each time we fix something, something new pops up. This all happened within 1 months. He has been wearing the e-collar all throughout this time and I want to see him happy and free. But as I said, new things start cropping up. First it was allergies, then immediately after a fungal infection, and now sneezing and moodyness. I am scared he has something bigger undiagnosed and these are just its outward symptoms. I don't know what exactly I'm asking. I'm a bit worried and don't want to make any mistakes. Can you please comment on what might be happening? Notes: We haven't been able to start his normal vaccinations because of these issues. So other than the Droncit and Stronghold, he isn't yet vaccinated against any disease.	AskVet
Need help/advice on applying to Berkeley as a freshman.	I'm applying to Berkeley this Fall as a freshman. I had some severe health issues (very painful gastrointestinal disease that went undiagnosed properly for years which made every day of school hell) throughout most of high school and I was forced to drop out in 12th grade in 2012 due to these problems and received my GED. I have recently achieved full remission from my illness and want to enter the UC system, Berkeley in particular since it's a target school for my desired industry, to major in Business Administration with a focus on finance. My high school a-g GPA is 3.68. Unfortunately though, I missed a few of the a-g course requirements in high school due to my illness. (Admissions told me to explain the reason for this as best I can in my admissions essay and that since I already received my GED I cannot make up the missed a-g courses) I do however have an SAT score of 2120 (I'm going to take the SAT subject test soon too) and have done volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity and am about to start working at a pre-college unpaid internship with a small local financial advisory firm. I understand this is a unique case but would appreciate some feedback/advice/anything on how to increase my chances of getting accepted. I know my health problems really set me back and I want to do anything I can to get a shot at UCB. I don't if they make exceptions for cases like this often to not. Thanks.	berkeley
Why aren't more people aware of how common, undiagnosed and awful Lyme Disease is?	I found out a month ago that I've had Lyme Disease for years now. My symptoms are, chronic exhaustion, impaired cognitive ability, slowness, cloudiness, attention problems, serious short and long term memory problems, stiff muscles, jerky movements, lockjaw, joint pain, arthritis onset, inability to remember words in the middle of sentences, slurred speech, disorganized speech, mania, depression and persistent suicidal thoughts. I'm 23, I got bit by a little fucking tick a few years ago and I've been degenerating in mind and body ever since. I got misdiagnosed once, all my college grades plummeted, I have a half dozen W's and F's I'll have to explain on my transcript and I fear I might permanently be dumber. This is fucking awful and I was under the impression that lyme disease just makes you tired and your bones ache.	NoStupidQuestions
Need help/advice with college choices for Analyst IB career.	I'm 21 years old in the LA area and have decided I want to work in IB as an analyst. Right now I need to make a very important decision regarding applying for college that will have a big impact on my goals. I dropped out of high school in 12th grade due to serious health problems I experienced all through high school (undiagnosed gastrointestinal disease that was extremely painful and made high school hell). About 6 months ago I achieved full remission and can finally attend college and accomplish career goals. Despite having a difficult time in high school my a-g high school GPA is 3.68, I have a 2120 on my SAT, volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity, and am about to begin an unpaid internship with a local wealth management company as an analyst. I have decided on Berkeley as my college because it is a great pipeline for west coast banking and Wall Street, which is where I want to work. The problem is due to my illness in high school I did not complete all of the a-g courses required for admission into the UC system. This is the only requirement I can't satisfy. I called the counselors office and they told me to explain in my essay the reason for this as best I can and hope for admission. If I apply in November and am admitted, I would start Fall 2016. Another option would be for me to attend Santa Monica College which is the #1 transfer school to the UC system. As a junior college student, my requirements for a UC Berkeley transfer will be different and they will judge my academic performance at Santa Monica College instead of high school, so my chances of getting accepted are much higher. If I decided to attend Santa Monica junior college first and then transferred to UC Berkeley how badly would this hurt my chances of scoring good internships and upon graduation, getting a good analyst job at a Wall Street bulge bracket? Is this route even worth taking? Either way I'm going to be taking the Level 1 CFA in my junior year. I'm just worried I'll be looked down on by internship recruiters and will have trouble getting a job at a top IB out of college. Any advice/guidance is greatly appreciated.	FinancialCareers
DAE feel as if your conditions/diseases/syndromes are still undiagnosed strictly for financial gain? I know better but we must just be awful at this part of science.	Edit: So let me preface this with I don't actually think this, but it is something I think about when I'm really down. :/ I'm anti conspiracy and all that shit, I'm a conservative leaning libertarian but I can't help this feeling because this is the most important aspect of my life. I know it's a longshot, but I am positive that most things are this way. Non transparent. Sure, it is easy for me to say this because I am angry I have been undiagnosed for so long without doctors coming even close. Lots of the times I feel as if I still have undiagnosable pain still after 10 years is because the industry is trying to make as much money on us as possible. I wouldn't be surprised if the medical community was purposely withholding my diagnoses for the sole purpose of financial gain from medications, consultations, procedures, and more. I know this is way out there in conspiracy theories but there's a lot of shit that goes down that we have no idea until somebody finally comes out with it. Think about it, there is so much money to be made. I mean, we see it with doctors just wanting to push as many surgeries and injections as possible. You'll also say those who are so kind and caring and who want to help you. I'm not saying this is exactly how it is, but I definitely think it's holds a sizeable chunk. **Very aware this is so far fetched but I just feel so lost and as if nobody cares about me enough to help me.** *I know that if people could help me, they would.*	ChronicPain
The time I stopped my Nmom from ruining a move	"I'm new here. This isn't a throwaway account; this screenname is one my limited-contact parents know I use, and if they care to find this post, they can. I am finally in a place in my life where I don't really have to worry about them anymore, so if they do, I'm not too concerned. Finding this place was a huge relief. I'm still unsure how to deal with them, and after reading everyone's stories I figured posting here might help me figure it out. Background info: I have a narcissistic mother who may also be schizophrenic, but undiagnosed. The schizophrenia doesn't excuse her abuse, but it does affect how it manifests. Namely, she'll be sweet as candy one moment, especially when people are around. Her mood will change at a moment's notice; if she gets angry at anything, she gets angry at everything and everyone around her. And then she'll change back like nothing happened. I also have an enabler dad. He was kind of the enigma of my life: part of why it took me such a long time to realize that my mother was abusive is because here was this normal guy that I generally looked up to, and yet he did nothing about it when she abused me, even defending her at times. If he considered it normal, well, my childhood mind with no other context reasoned that it must be. I also have a golden child for a younger brother. He had a disease when he was very young that left him with a mild but chronic condition that he still has today. He's perfectly functional, incredibly smart even. But because he was sick as a child, my mother has babied him throughout his life, taking his side against me no matter what. He learned that he could do anything he wanted to me, and generally did, only briefly stopping when my mother's antics turned on him, and then only long enough to get me on his side. In the interest of trying to help him get out, I let him get away with a bunch of stuff against me, but have finally given up hope for him. Other than him, there's two incidentals in the family: a niece of mine only six years younger than me that we took in for a couple years when I was a preteen, and a cousin of mine that they started raising about the time I moved out. So that's all the basic facts about the situation. Here's my first story. My dad's in the military; that means we moved a lot. We were in the process of moving from one base to another when I was 18. I had graduated high school at 16 and had gotten an associate's in a year. Because my mom was against the idea of her kids not being wholly dependent on her, she subtly sabotaged any attempts at independence, so I hadn't held any sort of job yet, had no resources to get out. They were moving back to a place we had lived before, where I knew people that might be able to help me leave, so I went along with it. Anyway, we were getting lunch on the road about two hours away from the place we were moving to. We got to talking about some technological stuff, I think it was video players and how either my dad or mom couldn't get a video to play on their computer. I explained codecs and DivX and all that, and said I could install the proper codec into Windows Media when we unpacked the laptop. My mom said that I was wrong, that that's not how codecs worked. She doesn't know much about technology, so I calmly asked her to tell me what a codec was. Minutes of frustrated silence in public elapsed until she whispered out ""I don't know."" We paid for the meal, and because we were in public, and then separated out to the two vans (I rode with my dad, my brother rode with my mom) I knew I was safe. So we drive down the road for a couple miles and then a rest area comes up. My mom, naturally in the lead van (she wears the pants in that house) signalled to pull over, so we pull over too. That's when it becomes apparent that she's been yelling about me nonstop since we left, and ""since she's such a dumb idiot, she's too stupid to drive and we're just going to sleep here."" Now, what you need to understand is that the city we were moving to had a massive sports event going on while we were moving there. There was literally not a single hotel room open in the city, but we had reserved one. If we didn't show up that night, we would forfeit our reservations and be homeless. So my mother was throwing a tantrum epic enough to render us all temporarily homeless. And my dad? Naturally, he was taking her side. The problem wasn't that he married a crazy abuser, but that I had dared to demonstrate her ignorance. ""You have only yourself to thank for the fact that we're sitting here,"" he bitched as we sat in a rest area two hours from our new home. I wasn't buying it, so I started to formulate a plan. Handing my laptop bag to my dad, I said ""Here, you should probably hold onto this for me, because it'll be too heavy for my trip."" ""Where are you going?"" he demanded. ""To [the city in question],"" I replied. ""Mom's nuts and you're nuts for going along with her. I'm going to go hitchhike, and when I get there, I'm gonna call my friend Colin from middle school for a place to stay. Enjoy getting yelled at in a cornfield, though."" He yelled at me to ""get back here"" as I walked away. And then I did it. I called my narcissistic mother's stupid bluff. I walked as far as the end of the rest area on-ramp before I saw my mom's van driving towards me, my dad's van right behind. My dad stopped and yelled ""Get in right now!"" So I did. He then berated me about how she was going to blow up and be angry for the rest of the night, and how I shouldn't have done what I did. ""But it WORKED, though."" He stammered and fumed. ""Just, shut the fuck up for the rest of the trip. I don't want to hear another word out of you."" I shrugged and let him exercise his meaningless authority. I didn't say another word for the trip. And sure enough, she pulled over and raged at him, and me. I smiled the most contemptuous smile I could muster, because I knew we were in public and she was powerless, but I kept silent. She raged harder and when my dad calmed her down, got back in her van. It was late when we got to the hotel, but we got there. We weren't homeless. Those gene donors of mine had me to thank for it, and that made even harder to swallow. Within a year, I was out of there."	raisedbynarcissists
Me [22 F] with my boyfriend [23 M] of a year. He no longer goes out of his way to do things for me or show me that he loves me...am I being too harsh? What do I do now?	"I've been dating Jake (fake name) for a year now, and it started off as a wonderful relationship. We were best friends for almost a year before we started dating, and I've honestly never connected with someone on so many levels: emotional, intellectual, spiritual, etc. The sex is wonderful but we also have a great time just *talking* about different topics. When the relationship started he was extremely passionate about it. Little notes, love letters, small gifts - not expensive things, but meaningful ones. We'd go on cute dates and do creative things together (painting, geocaching, etc.) that were really fun and exciting. Both of us are in college at different schools but we live approximately five minutes away from each other. I'm in my senior semester and am pretty busy writing my capstone paper for my major, and I also have a full time internship. He's doing some pretty difficult math classes and also works part time on the weekend at an ice-cream parlour. Over the last few months I've expressed being unhappy in the relationship because Jake just doesn't seem to put effort into me/us. Nothing. It's been disappointment after disappointment. I can tell that he loves me still, but I don't feel like a priority, or important at all. Here's a kind of breakdown for you guys: * He doesn't text me first anymore and doesn't send the same kind of loving texts/good morning ones that I used to get. I always have to contact him first. * Semi-frequently I'll give him small gifts that made me think of him (snacks in weird flavours, little pins for his coat, Magic cards that I think look cool - you know, you'll be shopping and see something and will think of your SO. * I cook for him a few times a week even though we don't live together so that he'll have healthy things to bring to school/work. * I pay for approximately half of our dates, so it's not just resting on him. * I also am the person who plans and comes up with most of our dates and activities. If I didn't do anything, I'm not sure if we'd really hang out much at all, let alone do anything fun. * I taught him how drive and until recently was the person who drove us to dates, picked him up at his house, and sometimes drove to get him from school. He only just got a car about six weeks ago. The final straw was (unsurprisingly) Valentine's Day. I'm not a materialistic person but I was hoping that he'd at least do a little something. I got him a custom box of chocolates and took us out on a surprise date to a national park, and he did...nothing. My hopes weren't high, but I was hoping for anything: a card, a chocolate bar, even a cute note or something. But there was nothing. This is a running theme in the relationship now. At this point I just don't know what to do. I **have** had talks about this before with him in a pretty logical manner, e.g. ""I don't feel like I'm that special to you lately, I'd really appreciate if you put some more effort into the relationship, etc."" His only response is ""I guess I'm not good enough for you"" and to get kind of sulky. I feel bad because I know that Jake is pretty busy, and usually has more homework than me. Most of our quality time together is spent studying so that he can get his work done. He also has some kind of undiagnosed chronic illness (like an allergy or an autoimmune disease) and deals with bouts of depression and anxiety. I'm super empathetic to this because I have hypothyroidism and accompanying major depression and panic attacks, so I understand what it's like to be tired and have limited energy. I've tried to get him to use the free therapy clinic at his school but he doesn't seem to want to, and he doesn't have the insurance or the money to see a doctor and get a blood panel done. I'm currently in therapy for my issues and take Synthroid for my thyroid, so generally I'm okay. But I feel so at a loss here; I pour so much into the relationship and I get nothing back. I don't play mind games with him - I let him know about the kind of things that I like, what chocolate or books or flowers are my favourite, that I miss his texts. Nothing. At this point I've thought about breaking up with him but I still love him, and we work so well together. He makes me laugh like nobody else and I can see myself marrying him...I just don't know how to fix this issue. What can I do? **tl;dr**: Boyfriend of one year no longer puts effort into the relationship. I've talked to him about this several times and see no change. What should I do?"	relationships
Me [23 M] and my GF [22f] of 4 years have been trying to become independent from her emotionally abusive father for almost a year and nothing seems to work and we just need any advice we can possibly get	"I started writing this hours ago and it ended up being so much longer than I expected. I don't want to bore everyone who reads it before they get to the point of what kind of answers we're looking for at the end, but I also feel like if I didn't give a large amount of detail it would make it very difficult to understand the total insanity that my girlfriend's dad has put us through. In fact, I've tried to explain this stuff to people without going into painful detail and they almost always assume we're overreacting until I go into it at length. So I've split the post into five sections with a TL;DR at the bottom of each one because I feel bad about how it drags on. You can skim through the main chunks and read teh TL;DR bits and get the gist of it if you don't want to read an obscenely long post, but if you do want the long-winded details that's also an option. **Background info** My girlfriend (we'll call her Jane) and I have been struggling with this situation for quite some time now, and it's been incredibly stressful for both of us and we're at the point now where so many things have happened with all of this that neither of us can remember it all anymore. We've been trying to deal with it ourselves but we're at the end of our rope and now we're hoping that posting here will get us any kind of help, no matter how small. Like I said this has been going on for a while, and I've never posted to this sub before so I apologize if this ends up being incredibly long, or if I screw up the formatting somehow. There seem to be quite a few rules so if I mess something up just let me know and I'll edit it. I'll start with a bit of background on how we met because it ties in with certain aspects of this problem we're facing. I had to take a semester off of college four years ago to get treated for cancer, and while I was in the hospital I met Jane through Facebook. She was one of the new members of the on-campus club that I socialized with the most, and I had been making it a point to talk to the new people so I wouldn't be a total stranger when I came back in the fall. Jane had gotten a transplant a few years before we met so she could relate well to my frustrations with being sick and hospitalized and I thought she was great in general so we ended up talking a lot that semester. Eventually our friendship shifted into a relationship and we've been together ever since. We both graduated the same semester, last spring, and we had been together for three years as the end of college was approaching. We wanted to live together once we got out of school but didn't really know how we'd make it all work, and then her dad (we'll call him Ross) made us an offer that sounded pretty appealing. He owns a house in Rhode Island, not too far from where we went to college, and he had finished the basement of his house into an apartment which had a bedroom, bathroom, living room, and kitchenette. Ross told us we could live in this basement apartment rent-free so long as we chipped in $60/week (I might be off on that figure but I'm fairly certain that's what it was) towards the grocery bill. He said he'd pay the rest of the food costs as long as we went out for the actual shopping. He also said he would want us to come upstairs regularly to be sociable and not just totally ignore him which was reasonable. We were told he wouldn't be barging in on our living space and he would let us have our privacy aside from coming down every now and then to make sure we were't trashing the place or anything. My cancer treatment left me with pretty severe chronic pain which I smoke cannabis for, and he was okay with it as long as I got onto the RI Medical Marijuana program as soon as possible. When I suggested signing some sort of general rental agreement he said that nothing like that would be necessary because the money was only for food and he wasn't going to charge us rent. *TL;DR* *Met a great girl (Jane) from my college while I was in the hospital with cancer and we ended up being in a happy and healthy relationship for the next three years of school. Then her dad gave us what seemed like a great offer to live rent free in his basement after graduation* **PART ONE: The Spider Debacle** So as school was ending Jane and I decided that living in her dad's basement was our best option and we started moving stuff in there as the semester was winding down and we were fully moved in once summer started. I want to point out that I had noticed that Ross has some sort of undiagnosed personality disorder, and that it is sometimes difficult to keep him engaged in a conversation where he has to maintain focus and relate to what people are saying to him but it had never struck me as something that was an issue. Having Asperger's Syndrome myself I'm pretty okay with being around people who are somewhat socially awkward. Beyond that he had mentioned having anger management issues that he was in treatment for and was keeping under control from what I saw, and he also has PTSD and anxiety as a result of his time as an Army Medic but he was also in treatment for those and was doing well with them. And he could sympathize with my somewhat disabling chronic pain because he also deals with a severe heart condition. None of this had struck me as an issue until shortly after Jane and I had moved in and it became clear that he was not very good at sticking to his agreements with people or listening to things he didn't want to hear. The first sign of trouble was when we started noticing extremely large spiders getting into the apartment. It's the kind of basement where one side has a regular door that opens up to the low side of a sloped lawn, and the door had a sizable chunk missing from the bottom. Not big to a person but big enough for any spider. And it wasn't helped by the fact that there was a huge pile of firewood just about five feet away from the outside door into the basement. So when I told him about these spiders getting in through the crack in the bottom of the door, his solution was for us to rearrange all our furniture, vacuum the whole basement, and spray the bottoms of the walls with spider spray. Which wasn't the worst idea I had ever heard so we gave it a shot, but the spiders just kept coming. And I tried to tell him that we just needed to seal up the bottom of the door and possibly move the wood but he would always just act like he didn't hear me and demand that we vacuum the entire basement every few days. It's important to note that during this time neither Jane nor myself had found jobs yet and constantly moving furniture around and hunting down spiders was making job searching difficult. He noticed the lack of employment and became incredibly overbearing in his attempts to ""help"" us find jobs. He would tell Jane to contact her transplant doctor for a letter of recommendation even though she had never been associated with this doctor in a professional capacity, and he would tell me repeatedly to call labs that weren't even in my field of science and that I would absolutely not be qualified for. There were other examples of his ""help"" with our job searches but this is already going to be long enough without including all of it. As weeks went by he would get more and more offended that we weren't taking his advice and he also started complaining about the cost of groceries which was partly due to us not being able to pay for any of them, and partly due to the fact that he never cooks for himself (his fridge was basically full of ice cream and expired condiments and leftovers from his constant eating out). His feelings about us not appreciating him enough were also fueled by the fact that my car died and he was letting me borrow his extra vehicle free of charge (which I admit was one of the several ways he was being pretty generous to us). Then there was his bizarre interpretation of ""privacy"" and staying out of the basement. He would come down every few days to tell us that he didn't like the way we had things arranged, and would have us constantly moving things around (beyond the furniture moving for the spiders). I had one of those coat racks that you hang off the top of a door, and he decided that it looked too cluttered for his tastes and said that we had to take it down and he would put a coat rack on the wall in the entryway (basically a concrete-floored room with the outside door at one end and a door to the finished section of the basement at the other) and we had to hang our coats out there. I told him I didn't like that idea because as I said it was right next to the outside door where these huge spiders were still coming in, and his entire response to my concern was ""spiders need to keep warm too."" This is the first time that I felt that it was necessary to take a firm stand on something because I was already losing my patience with the constant spiders and I told him that not only was I not putting my coats out there but he needed to stop having us rearrange the furniture and actually do something about the crack in the door and he was clearly pissed but agreed to get something done. It should also be mentioned that Ross has a guy that he pays to do all of his cleaning, mowing, snowblowing and anything else he needs and he pays him huge amounts of money because just because he can, and it wouldn't have been any issue at all for him to ask his handyman to fix the door. So a day or two goes by and he comes down and yet again tells us to move everything away from the walls, vacuum and spray poison along the walls. I was fed up and told him that this was a ridiculous idea because the floors were vacuumed so much already and none of this had brought about any results. He explained to me that we had to vacuum because spiders are attracted to carpet lint and that the use it to build their ""nests"" so vacuuming was essential to getting rid of them. He also went on a long rant about how spiders send scouts out into your house and when the scouts come back the ones in the ""nests"" see the poison and they lick it off for the other spiders and every time this happens some of them die, so you just have to keep spraying poison until all of the spiders get killed from licking each other. At this point I couldn't just keep humoring him anymore because even though I had found a job it wasn't full-time like they had said it would be so I now had to be going to work and applying for as many jobs as possible in my free time and I didn't have time to keep doing all this bizarre shit. When I sat down with him and explained why exactly the carpet lint nest and poison licking shit wasn't true, I was sure to do my research on what actually does attract and kill spiders first, and I had no idea how pissed he was going to get. He was pissed off that I was ambushing him, he was pissed off that I was too lazy to rearrange all my stuff every other day and vacuum constantly, and he was especially pissed off that I had the nerve to trust some random asshole on the internet more than him. But the crack in the door got fixed and the spiders finally stopped. And this is basically how things went with everything that came up as an issue while I lived there. *TL;DR* *Ross (Jane's father) becomes incredibly over-bearing and repeatedly disregards things that cause a lot of stress for Jane and I as if they shouldn't be issues at all, and that just makes things even more stressful. We soon realize that he doesn't give a shit about what we want and we're just supposed to stop and start our lives at his whim* **PART TWO: The Situation Escalates** As it got late into the summer Jane and I started becoming incredibly depressed because Ross's antics were a daily drain of our energy and the job market was still not giving us anything promising. Somehow we managed to convince him to let us get a kitten to keep downstairs to help keep the spiders out (this was before he finally got the door fixed) and she was the only thing that kept us from going totally crazy. I think the example of the spider debacle gives a pretty clear picture of what Ross is like when he wants to be unbelievably difficult with something so I can skim over the issues we had now and just let it be known that all of these things played out in more or less the same kind of way. While my job was shitty I still had a job so he was worse with Jane on the job search issue at this point, and he also realized that she didn't argue with his outlandish demands as much as I did. He kept finding her places that he wanted her to work at, mostly places where he was a customer of some sort, and he'd tell her over and over to call them. None of them ever actually matched her qualifications and most of them weren't even hiring, but he thought because he had met people there they would just find him so damn charming that they'd give his daughter a job anyway. She didn't argue with him but also didn't call most of the time, so he would call and one time he sent a really nasty email to a lady at one of these places because she didn't contact Jane after he gave her Jane's email address. Any time he managed to force her to meet with any of these people it was an incredibly humiliating and uncomfortable experience for her and never resulted in a job. He would come down to the basement while I was at work and he would give Jane lists of more insane stupid things he was making us do and he would always be sure to leave before I got home so I wouldn't be able to tell him no right away. If he was being particularly demanding I would go upstairs and try to explain to him why the things he was telling us to do were a problem and he would get more pissed off at me. He also started flipping our kitten on her back and waving his hands over her to get her to swat at him which lead to her lunging at mine and Jane's hands all the time and scratching us. He still kept telling us that we had to rearrange our living space to be more like the way he would choose to have it. He almost never reimbursed us for the right amounts of the grocery bills and when we told him we needed to know what he was planning on paying he was completely blown away. He could not grasp the fact that if he chose to pay us for much less than he would agree to before then I wouldn't have enough money for gas to get to work. He would regularly get extremely angry if we brought it up and would take all the money from his wallet and throw it at us, and then a few minutes later come back and say he needed the money back because he forget he had to spend it on something the next day. Jane was exhausted all the time, she just simply did not have the energy to handle him constantly coming down every time I was gone so he could corner her and make her spend hours calling companies that weren't hiring to ask for jobs. She was incredibly depressed, and I was as well. We tried to sit down and discuss these problems with him a few times, telling him that his endless demands were running us into the ground, and his response was almost always to tell Jane that she spends too much time sitting around downstairs and that she just needed to get more time out in the sun and she'd feel better. Jane was avoiding contact with him whenever she could because it was the only way she could hope to get a moment's rest. He noticed and he didn't like this at all. She started sending me up to deal with him because he's the kind of person who will steamroll you in a conversation if you don't hold your ground, and she's much too shy and timid to deal with that. He saw this and assumed I was abusing her, and forcing her to stay away from him. He never said it to me but it became a cornerstone of the conversations he would have with (though it was more like ""at"" than ""with"") her every time I left the house. It almost never mattered what we said to him, and we both felt so trapped and defeated constantly. The unending stress put incredible strain on our relationship, and we started fighting at extremes we had never even dreamed we could fight at before. Almost always about Ross, and how to deal with him and when we should just do what he said and when we should stick up for ourselves. Of course, it didn't help that he could hold things over our heads like the fact that we lived there rent free and that he was still letting me use his extra car. But the car was so bad on gas and I got so little hours that I was actually losing money by working. *TL;DR* *Ross kept getting more and more demanding, especially on Jane. He took every time I was out of the house as a chance to corner her and give her more insanely demanding tasks to do. She had to take time away from applying to actual jobs when he would come down and make her call places that weren't hiring but he thought she'd fit in at. When this made us both depressed, he said it was our own fault for not going outside enough* **PART THREE: The Situation Comes to a Head** The job I had kept promising I'd get more hours as summer ended, but it didn't seem to be happening. I eventually interviewed for a job somewhere closer stockings shelves at a big chain retailer. I told them about my back pain from my cancer and how I'd have to work slow to not hurt myself and they said that it would be fine. This came just in time, because I had lost all the money I had putting gas into the V8 engine of the car Ross was letting me borrow, while I was commuting to a job that would give me as little as five hours in one week. When this happened it wasn't a single shift, it was one two hour shift and one three hour shift and my commute was 45 minutes away. So I had no choice but to take the job stocking shelves. Even though I was careful to pace myself and not stock any of the super heavy items I was still right at the limit of how much I could exert myself without going too far and causing a ton of pain. I was the slowest one on the team and everyone could tell, and everyone treated me like shit for it. Maybe my interpretation was biased because I was already so incredibly depressed, but my coworkers hardly ever talked to me except to tell me what I was doing wrong, and when they did talk to me they sounded extremely annoyed. After about two weeks of this I met with my manager to talk about what was going on. He had been the one who interviewed me and said I could take things slow if I needed to and he didn't want me hurting my back, but suddenly he seemed less sympathetic. It wasn't even like I was just standing around doing nothing, I was just working at a bit of a slower pace, but for some reason he changed his mind. I asked him if I was misreading the situation, and said how it seemed like nobody wanted me there and I asked him if my pace was going to end up being an issue after all. He told me that as fall progressed things only got harder, and if I was already having trouble keeping up he didn't see how I'd be able to manage. I was in pain, I was unbearably depressed, and I had never felt more defeated before in my life. Luckily Jane had just gotten hired at a full-time job and I knew we could get through at least. So I told him I was sorry to disappoint him but I clearly wasn't going to be able to do what they wanted, and I left that day. I called my parents on the verge of tears, thinking there was no way I could ever sink lower. And then I found out that had I not left voluntarily and worked at my own pace and put up with the disapproval until the fired me then I could have collected unemployment, but there was no chance of that now and I felt like the biggest idiot alive. Ross had left for the weekend so I wasn't able to tell him about it until a few days later. I had pretty low expectations of his ability to empathize at this point but I thought he would at least understand the difficulty of the situation enough to feel a little bad for me. But that's not what happened. When I told him I had to leave he started arguing with me about how I was just using my damaged spinal nerves as an excuse to be lazy and mooch off of him. He started accusing me of saying things I never said. He claimed that I had said I couldn't work at an office job because sitting at a desk would hurt my back too, but I had actually told him several times that I was hoping for a desk job because it would be so much less likely to cause me pain. But he doesn't listen when anyone talks to him, and he had recently gotten into an argument with his anger management therapist and quit going (he does this weird ""baby-talk"" voice when he tries to be funny and it's incredibly off-putting, and I guess his therapist tried to suggest using it less and he freaked out). So he had just been getting more and more angry with me over the previous two weeks or so, and that night he decided to kick me out of his house. My dad took me back to my parent's house in CT that night, and I've been here ever since. Ross came downstairs with his mother (who lives right next door) and they both lectured Jane for several hours, about how she's avoiding him and he's her father and it's an awful thing for her to do. Ross' mother literally told Jane that she was killing him, and that if she didn't start talking to him more he would die. Jane just sat there, hardly said a word and sank deeper into depression. *TL;DR* *I left my first job because it wasn't even paying me enough to afford gas, and got another job that was much closer. While my second job said in my interview that they would work with me and my physical limitations from my cancer treatment, I quickly found out that that wasn't really the case. And in a fit of extreme depression and physical discomfort I made the mistake of quitting instead of letting them fire me and couldn't even collect unemployment. When Ross found out, he kicked me out of the house and used his mother to help guilt-trip Jane and tell her that she was literally killing him by not talking to him enough* **PART FOUR: The Last Few Months/Final Part and Questions We Have** Jane is still managing to get by, but every day is a struggle for her just to wake up and drive to work. Just being awake takes so much out of her. At one point she had saved up enough to buy me a minivan (which is really ideal because the posture doesn't hurt my back) and I finally got a desk job through a temp agency and I was making decent money and I felt like our lives might actually be going somewhere. But then I got a radiator leak, and I was an idiot and took too long to get it fixed. I spent most of my money on getting a new radiator just to have my van die as soon as I got it to work the next day. It turned out I had blown a head gasket and I have so much guilt over it every day. The office I was working at was pretty understanding about the fact that I had to miss work until I got a new vehicle, but unfortunately the work I was brought in to help cover was all done just a few days after I had to scrap the van so I ended up with no job and no car. I feel horrible about wasting Jane's money like that, and my parents are going to be spending the last $1500 they have from their tax return on buying me another car. Jane only had to pay $1200 for the minivan but the used car market seems to have dried up a lot since then and I don't know when I'll be able to find something in our price range that isn't a huge lemon. All Jane and I want is to both have our own cars (she still has to borrow one of Ross's) and to work and get paid enough to live in a shitty apartment somewhere, but we can't even get that. This has lasted so much longer than either of us thought it would, and every day I feel less and less hopeful. The night Ross kicked me out I told him that he had to start cleaning the litter box for our kitten, because transplant patients have to take immuno-suppressants and Jane's doctors have said that there's some sort of disease in cat urine which is known for being extremely dangerous for transplant patients to come into contact with. He did it for a while, and then eventually I had to start doing it whenever I made it over to visit Jane. It got to a point where I was timing my visits with when the litter box got full. But now I can't do it, and Ross has been having major health problems lately and is in the hospital half the time. Even as I was typing this Jane had to clean the litter box for the second time since I left, and I'm just so scared for her safety because I can't even make it the 45 minutes to Ross' house to scoop out cat piss. The reason I decided to post here is I saw that post from the woman who was living in a cult with her children and husband, and this sub was able to help her and her kids run away and get out of that situation. She said they were almost completely broke but they at least got away. Ross is emotionally abusive and manipulative, but none of the emergency housing programs around here will do anything unless there's physical abuse. I've spent hours calling to different organizations trying to get as much help as we can but the waiting lists are sometimes years long and a lot of the time they say our situation just isn't bad enough to qualify because there aren't enough resource and they have to be extremely selective. I tried starting a GoFundMe page a few months back but someone commented saying that I should be ashamed of myself asking for other people to solve my problems because some people are full-on paralyzed and I just have pain and I should just be thankful for how lucky I am. I was already so depressed that seeing that comment just killed me, and I deleted the page and spent the rest of the day laying in bed. So my hope is that someone who sees this post will know more about getting through things like this than I do, and that some of the comments will give me and Jane ideas we never considered before that will help us put an end to this nightmare we've been living for almost a year. If you think we're just not trying hard enough and I'm just a stupid whiner for posting this then please don't comment saying so. I assure you I already think more negatively about myself than you do and telling me how badly I've fucked up in this situation won't contribute anything that I don't already know. But if you see this post and you have any thoughts of something we could do differently that might get us out of this, however unlikely, please tell me. I just want to get Jane away from her father and take her with me to a place where she won't be living with someone who treats her like shit every single day. I just want us to be happy and together like we used to be. *TL;DR* *We're both so defeated and depressed right now, and we hardly get to see each other. We're looking for any advice at all that might help us get out of this situation, even if we can only get into a shithole apartment in a scary neighborhood. I'm just asking for any and all suggestions for how we can solve this problem and be happy again.*"	relationships

We are delighted to invite you all to attend and register for the “Annual Summit on Sleep Disorders and Medicine (Sleep Medicine-2015)”, which is going to be held during August10-12, 2015 San Francisco, USA.The main theme of the conference is “Medical conditions related to sleep disorders and advanced sleep therapy"" which covers a wide range of critically important sessions. The conference would lay a platform for interaction among the experts throughout the world and aims in accelerating the discussion of sleep disorders which is major issue for youth throughout the globe. The conference throws light on topics like Novel Insights to Sleep Disorders, Common Sleep Disorders: Causes and Treatment, Stress related Disorders, Mental and Physical Causes of Insomnia, Mental Health Disorders Related to Sleep Disorders, Hypersomnolence, Pediatric Sleep Disorders: Diagnosis and Treatment,Sleep Therapy Approaches,Sleep, The Heart and The Brain, Trends in Sleep medicine and therapy, Business in Sleep Medicine and many more. The organizing committee is gearing up for an exciting and informative conference program including plenary lectures, symposia, workshops on a variety of topics, poster presentations and various programs for participants from all over the world. We invite you to join us at the Sleep Medicine-2015 International Conference, where you are sure to have a meaningful experience with scholars from around the world. All the Organizing Committee Members of the Sleep Medicine-2015 International Conference look forward to meet you in San Francisco, USA. For more details please visit-http://sleepmedicine.global-summit.com/ The main target audience of Sleep Medicine-2015 is general public as the problem is quite common among them. However, apart from general audience we can target sleep drugs producing pharmaceutical industries and researchers who are engaged on sleep disorders research. With members from around the world focused on learning about sleep disorders and ways to manage it; this is your single best opportunity to reach the largest assemblage of participants from stress related field. Conduct demonstrations, distribute information, meet with current and potential customers, and make a start with a new product line, at this 3-day event. World-renowned speakers with their ultimate talks on the most recent techniques, tactics, and the avantgarde technologies in Sleep Medicine are the hallmarks of this conference. Statistically it has been found that around 50-70 million of the total population of United States experience sleep or wakefulness disorder. Notably, snoring is a major indicator of obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep is increasingly recognized as important to public health, with sleep insufficiency linked to motor vehicle crashes, industrial disasters, and medical and other occupational errors. Unintentionally falling asleep, nodding off while driving, and having difficulty performing daily tasks because of sleepiness all may contribute to these hazardous outcomes. Persons experiencing sleep insufficiency are also more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and obesity, as well as from cancer, increased mortality, and reduced quality of life and productivity. Sleep insufficiency may be caused by broad scale societal factors such as round-the-clock access to technology and work schedules, but sleep disorders such as insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea also play an important role. Reasons for sleep disorders Most of us have experienced trouble sleeping at one time or another. This is normal and usually temporary, due to stress or other outside factors. But if sleep problems are a regular occurrence and interfere with your daily life, you may be suffering from a sleep disorder. Sleep disorders cause more than just sleepiness. The lack of quality sleep can have a negative impact on your energy, emotional balance, and health. If you’re experiencing sleeping problems, learn about the symptoms of common sleep disorders, what you can do to help yourself, and when to see a doctor. Diseases associated with sleep disorders Narcolepsy affects both males and female equally and appears throughout the world. Symptoms often start in childhood or adolescence, but can occur later in life. The condition is life-long. Narcolepsy is not rare, but it is an underrecognized and underdiagnosed condition. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is estimated to affect about one in every 3,000 Americans. More cases without cataplexy are also likely to exist. Symptoms Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), Cataplexy, Sleep paralysis, Hallucinations, Disrupted nocturnal sleep, Obesity When do symptoms appear? In most cases, symptoms first appear when people are between the ages of 7 and 25. In rare cases, however, narcolepsy may appear at younger age or in older adults. If left undiagnosed and untreated, early onset narcolepsy can interfere with psychological, social, and cognitive function and development and can undermine academic and social activities. Global market value for sleep is 33 billion dollars in 2014 Sleep research in USA Industry Analysis &amp; Industry Trends In the past five years, revenue has grown rapidly. Sleep clinics have gained exposure during the period due to the rising number of sleep disorders brought on by electronic stimuli in the form of laptops and smartphones. Research findings show that the light emitted from these gadgets limits melatonin release, a hormone that regulates sleep. As usage of devices increases, so do sleep issues that require attention from industry clinics. Moreover, health insurance policies are increasingly covering all or at least part of the costs of tests and, as more patients have been able to gain greater access to specialized sleep clinics What is the Sleep Disorder Clinics Industry? Establishments in this industry are devoted to the diagnosis and care of outpatients with disorders that affect, disrupt or more generally involve sleep. Common sleep disorders include insomnia, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome and sleepwalking. Industry clinics are often associated with hospitals or medical schools. Industry Products Physician consultationsDiagnostic in-lab and in-home sleep testingContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy Sleep research Industry Activities Providing physician consultations Providing diagnostic in-lab and home sleep testing providing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy Performing sleep research Industries producing sleep apnea products are ResMed, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare, Philips Respironics etc., New sleep apnea treatment could help millions There is a new treatment for sleep apnea that could help millions of Americans get a good night's rest and avoid the dangerous long-term consequences of leaving the disorder untreated. Some 18 million Americans suffer from the affliction. Those who have it experience drawing breath at night because the muscles in their neck relax during sleep, causing the airway to collapse. They snore, wake repeatedly, and never get a proper full night's sleep. This can lead to heart problems and other serious issues, even death. OMICS International through its Open Access Initiative is resolved to make veritable and solid commitments to mainstream researchers. OMICS Group has over4000 leading-edge peer reviewed on Open Access Journals and sorts out over 300 International Conferences yearly everywhere throughout the world. OMICS Publishing Group journals have over 3 million readers and the fame and success of the same can be attributed to the strong editorial board which contains over 30000 eminent personalities that ensure a rapid, quality and quick review process.

Internet of DNA	Noah is a six-year-old suffering from a disorder without a name. This year, his physicians will begin sending his genetic information across the Internet to see if there’s anyone, anywhere, in the world like him. A match could make a difference. Noah is developmentally delayed, uses a walker, speaks only a few words. And he’s getting sicker. MRIs show that his cerebellum is shrinking. His DNA was analyzed by medical geneticists at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Somewhere in the millions of As, Gs, Cs, and Ts is a misspelling, and maybe the clue to a treatment. But unless they find a second child with the same symptoms, and a similar DNA error, his doctors can’t zero in on which mistake in Noah’s genes is the crucial one. In January, programmers in Toronto began testing a system for trading genetic information with other hospitals. These facilities, in locations including Miami, Baltimore, and Cambridge, U.K., also treat children with so-called ­Mendelian disorders, which are caused by a rare mutation in a single gene. The system, called MatchMaker Exchange, represents something new: a way to automate the comparison of DNA from sick people around the world. One of the people behind this project is David Haussler, a bioinformatics expert based at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The problem Haussler is grappling with now is that genome sequencing is largely detached from our greatest tool for sharing information: the Internet. That’s unfortunate because more than 200,000 people have already had their genomes sequenced, a number certain to rise into the millions in years ahead. The next era of medicine depends on large-scale comparisons of these genomes, a task for which he thinks scientists are poorly prepared. “I can use my credit card anywhere in the world, but biomedical data just isn’t on the Internet,” he says. “It’s all incomplete and locked down.” Genomes often get moved around in hard drives and delivered by FedEx trucks. Haussler is a founder and one of the technical leaders of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, a nonprofit organization formed in 2013 that compares itself to the W3C, the standards organization devoted to making sure the Web functions correctly. Also known by its unwieldy acronym, GA4GH, it’s gained a large membership, including major technology companies like Google. Its products so far include protocols, application programming interfaces (APIs), and improved file formats for moving DNA around the Web. But the real problems it is solving are mostly not technical. Instead, they are sociological: scientists are reluctant to share genetic data, and because of privacy rules, it’s considered legally risky to put people’s genomes on the Internet. The unfolding calamity in genomics is that a great deal of life-saving information, though already collected, is inaccessible. But pressure is building to use technology to study many, many genomes at once and begin to compare that genetic information with medical records. That is because scientists think they’ll need to sort through a million genomes or more to solve cases—like Noah’s—that could involve a single rogue DNA letter, or to make discoveries about the genetics of common diseases that involve a complex combination of genes. No single academic center currently has access to information that extensive, or the financial means to assemble it. Haussler and others at the alliance are betting that part of the solution is a peer-to-peer computer network that can unite widely dispersed data. Their standards, for instance, would permit a researcher to send queries to other hospitals, which could choose what level of information they were willing to share and with whom. This control could ease privacy concerns. Adding a new level of complexity, the APIs could also call on databases to perform calculations—say, to reanalyze the genomes they store—and return answers. The day I met Haussler, he was wearing a faded ­Hawaiian shirt and taking meetings on a plastic lawn chair by a hotel pool in San Diego. Both of us were there to attend one of the world’s largest annual gatherings of geneticists. He told me he was worried that genomics was drifting away from the open approach that had made the genome project so powerful. If people’s DNA data is made more widely accessible, Haussler hopes, medicine may benefit from the same kind of “network effect” that’s propelled so many commercial aspects of the Web. The alternative is that this vital information will end up marooned in something like the disastrous hodgepodge of hospital record systems in the United States, few of which can share information. One argument for quick action is that the amount of genome data is exploding. The largest labs can now sequence human genomes to a high polish at the pace of two per hour. (The first genome took about 13 years.) Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that fast machines for DNA sequencing will be capable of producing 85 petabytes of data this year worldwide, twice that much in 2019, and so on. For comparison, all the master copies of movies held by Netflix take up 2.6 petabytes of storage. “This is a technical question,” says Adam Berrey, CEO of Curoverse, a Boston startup that is using the alliance’s standards in developing open-source software for hospitals. “You have what will be exabytes of data around the world that nobody wants to move. So how do you query it all together, at once? The answer is instead of moving the data around, you move the questions around. No industry does that. It’s an insanely hard problem, but it has the potential to be transformative to human life.” Today scientists are broadly engaged in what is, in effect, a project to document every variation in every human gene and determine what the consequences of those differences are. Individual human beings differ at about three million DNA positions, or one in every 1,000 genetic letters. Most of these differences don’t matter, but the rest explain many things that do: heartbreaking disorders like Noah’s, for example, or a higher than average chance of developing glaucoma. So imagine that in the near future, you had the bad luck to develop cancer. A doctor might order DNA tests on your tumor, knowing that every cancer is propelled by specific mutations. If it were feasible to look up the experience of everyone else who shared your tumor’s particular mutations, as well as what drugs those people took and how long they lived, that doctor might have a good idea of how to treat you. The unfolding calamity in genomics is that a great deal of this life-saving information, though already collected, is inaccessible. “The limiting factor is not the technology,” says David Shaywitz, chief medical officer of DNAnexus, a bioinformatics company that hosts several large collections of gene data. “It’s whether people are willing.” Last summer Haussler’s alliance launched a basic search engine for DNA, which it calls Beacon. Currently, Beacon searches through about 20 databases of human genomes that were previously made public and have implemented the alliance’s protocols. Beacon offers only yes-or-no answers to a single type of question. You can ask, for instance, “Do any of your genomes have a T at position 1,520,301 on chromosome 1?” “It’s really just the most basic question there is: have you ever seen this variant?” says Haussler. “Because if you did see something new, you might want to know, is this the first patient in the world that has this?” Beacon is already able to access the DNA of thousands of people, including hundreds of genomes put online by Google. One of the cofounders of the Global Alliance is David ­Altshuler, who is now head of science at Vertex Pharmaceuticals but until recently was deputy chief of the MIT-Harvard Broad Institute, one of the largest academic DNA-sequencing centers in the United States. The day I visited Altshuler in his Broad office, his whiteboard was covered with diagrams showing genetic inheritance in families, as well the word “Napster” written in large blue letters—a reference to the famously disruptive music-sharing service of the 1990s. Altshuler has his own reasons for wanting to connect massive amounts of genetic data. As an academic researcher, he hunted for the genetic causes of common diseases like diabetes. That work was carried out by comparing the DNA of afflicted and unafflicted people, trying to spot the differences that come up most often. After burning through countless research grants this way, geneticists realized there would be no easy answers, no common “diabetes genes” or “depression genes.” It turns out that common diseases aren’t caused by single, smoking-gun defects. Instead, a person’s risk, scientists have learned, is determined by a combination of hundreds, if not tens of thousands, of rare variations in the DNA code. That’s created a huge statistical headache. Last July, in a report listing 300 authors, Broad looked at the genes of 36,989 people with schizophrenia. Even though schizophrenia is highly heritable, the 108 gene regions identified by the scientists explained only a small percentage of a person’s risk for the disease. Altshuler believes that big gene studies are still a good way to “crack” these illnesses, but he thinks it will probably take millions of genomes to do it. The way the math works out, sharing data no longer looks optional, whether researchers are trying to unravel the causes of common diseases or ultra-rare ones. “There’s going to be an enormous change in how science is done, and it’s only because the signal-to-noise ratio necessitates it,” says Arthur Toga, a researcher who leads a consortium studying the science of Alzheimer’s at the University of Southern California. “You can’t get your result with just 10,000 patients—you are going to need more. Scientists will share now because they have to.” Privacy, of course, is an obstacle to sharing. People’s DNA data is protected because it can identify them, like a fingerprint—and their medical records are private too. Some countries don’t permit personal information to be exported for research. But Haussler thinks a peer-to-peer network can sidestep some of these worries, since the data won’t move and access to it can be gated. More than half of Europeans and Americans say they’re comfortable with the idea of sharing their genomes, and some researchers believe patient consent forms should be dynamic, a bit like Facebook’s privacy controls, letting individuals decide what they’ll share and with whom—and then change their minds. “Our members want to be the ones to decide, but they aren’t that worried about privacy. They’re sick,” says Sharon Terry, head of the Genetic Alliance, a large patient advocacy organization. The risk of not getting data sharing right is that the genome revolution could sputter. Some researchers say they are seeing signs that it’s happening already. Kym Boycott, head of the research team that sequenced Noah’s genome, says that when the group adopted sequencing as a research tool in 2010, it met with immediate success. Over two years, between 2011 and 2013, a network of Canadian geneticists uncovered the precise molecular causes of 146 conditions, solving 55 percent of their undiagnosed cases. But the success rate appears to be tailing off, says ­Boycott. Now it’s the tougher cases like Noah’s that are left, and they are getting solved only half as often as the others. “We don’t have two patients with the same thing anymore. That’s why we need the exchange,” she says. “We need more patients and systematic sharing to get the [success rate] back up.” In late January, when I asked if MatchMaker Exchange had yielded any matches yet, she demurred, saying that it could be a matter of weeks before the software was fully operational. As for Noah, she said, “We are still waiting to sort him out. It’s important for this little guy.”	DNA
Could Non-Psychopathic Misanthropes Be On The Spectrum?	"I was browsing Experience Project website and found [this](http://www.experienceproject.com/groups/Am-A-Misanthrope/45313). I think I've noticed something interesting. I don't condone misanthropy, but I understand how and why they would feel like this (when many people act horribly to others). Many misanthropes vent their frustrations with society, and their disappointments with human nature. Of course, some misanthropes I would not want to associate with. I think they're better off (and that it's for the best) that they remain on the outskirts of society. I'm talking about the ones who *say* that they hate murders and killing, but wouldn't hesitate to push a metaphorical button killing all of humanity (they are human too). Obviously, this is inconsistent. It's also scary and a form of psychopathy. Misanthropes like this are no better than the ""human diseases"" they hate (and humans aren't a disease), because these are psychopaths. But I mean those misanthropes without psychopathic tendencies. Many misanthropes seem to express a lot of aspie-like thinking, such as non-conformity of groups, non-hierarchical thinking, being taken advantage of when only trying to do good, following the rules, not fitting into society, finding society inane, a strong disliking to racism, sexism and homophobia, etc. These sound similar to aspie frustrations, so I'm wondering if maybe many misanthropes could actually be undiagnosed aspies??? If so, do you think that diagnosis could provide the self-understanding and closure they need to make the world, in relation to themselves, make sense? DISCLAIMER: Please don't use this to bash NTs and please don't think that this is another topic used to bash NTs. That's not the purpose of this discussion. Nor am I trying to advocate misanthropy for the autistic community, since we're social too and many of us want to be social (with the right people). And I'm not trying to say that NTs are the anti-social variation of the misanthropes (I think Adam Lanza was a frustrated misanthrope). The point that I'm trying to make is, I think a great majority, but not all, misanthropes might actually be on the spectrum. Are many of you at least understanding of misanthropes? Also: Do any of you feel as if you might have been/could have been misanthropic?"	aspergers
Have you tried going non-gluten for a while? What did you think? [I swear I'm not a gluten bro-science person, I just want to experiement]	"I have hypothyroidism, and undiagnosed back and knee pains. So naturally I have problems with my metabolism and inflammation in my body. I've been eating non-gluten (meat eater, a lot of fish) for 2 weeks now. I don't know if it's a placebo effect, but my energy levels feel more stable and my gut and body doesn't feel that sore. I had some pains in my back last weekend, but that could be because I slept in a new bed for a few days, and my parents shitty sofa. I also don't eat lactose. Of course I'm entirely open to the possibility that this is all placebo. What about you? I should add that I do not have celiacs disease (I don't think). I haven't gotten tested.

[Serious] Has anyone ever seen a doctor/psychiatrist in S'pore for ADHD?	I am beginning to suspect that my difficulties in concentration and attention stem from undiagnosed ADHD. While i also feel that it is very easy for people to make excuses for their behaviour,id like to be able to treat this if i do have the disease. Can anyone tell me if the treatment in Singapore is useful?	singapore
Kidney Disease Sucks	"http://www.gofundme.com/mrx3e0 I was diagnosed with IGA Nephropathy (also known as Berger's Disease) back in 2007. My doctors discovered I had started developing this in 1996 when my son was born and I was incorrectly diagnosed with Preeclampsia; leaving me undiagnosed for 11 years. The gestation period from start to renal failure is 15-20 years. In 2014 my kidneys had failed to the point where I was extremely ill and missing 1-3 days a week from work or more. I was hospitalized many times and still trying to work to maintain my home and pay all the growing medical costs. I started doing home dialysis in June of 2014 and chose this way because I needed to continue working. Most people with kidney failure work part-time or not at all. I continue to work full-time (as much as I can anyway), because I have no choice. However, over the last 2 years while I started to get extremely ill from this, the bills kept piling up. I've been able to maintain keeping our apartment where I live with my son, but that's about where it ends. I've been struggling to keep gas in my car so I can get to work and my appointments; I've had to go to food pantries and practically begging people for help with food; I""ve gotten assistance with rent so we're not homeless; I've faced eviction, losing my car, and even losing the necessary electricty I need to run my dialysis machine every night; the medical bills keep growing and growing and they're certainly not stopping. Insurance only covers 80% of the costs (up to $100k a year, with all costs involved) associated with this. and only for 3 years; after that, I'm on my own. Medicaid can help, but the cost of that is $150 a month, which I can't afford either. I've always been the type of person to make my own way...with this disease it grows harder and harder. So...here I am, looking for any help at all to help with some basic needs and to help with some of my growing and never-ending medical costs. My family has been a huge support system emotionally, but we don't come from money, so they help where they can, but it's just not enough. This is extremely humbling, but I don't know where else to turn. TL;DR Kidney Disease Sucks"	gofundme
Heavy week-long NSAID use vs hormonal birth control (IUD): which is riskier in terms of side effects and long term health?	"TL;DR: From a health standpoint, in terms of side effects and long term health, which is riskier, heavy monthly week-long NSAID use or mirena? I've suffered from dysmenorrhea since my teens, and my cycle is somewhat irregular -- for the last 2 years I've begun to spot from ovulation until my period, and I lose about 120mls of fluid during my 8-day period, not including spotting (measured with menstrual cups and estimated from soaked tampon usage). My OBGyn basically won't Rx any pain meds but suggested I try naproxen, otherwise, I should go on the mirena. Normal ultrasound. * Age: 28 * Sex: F * Height: 5'4"" * Weight: 103 lbs * Race: caucasion * Duration of complaint: 15 years * Location (Geographic and on body): uterus * Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): * Current medications (if any): 440-660mg naproxen or 1200-2000mg ibuprofen daily before and during menstruation. Otherwise: 1000iu vitamin d daily, 2400mg N Acetyl-cysteine daily * Recent ultrasound showed normal uterus/overies. * Other relevant family history: maternal grandfather had stroke in his 60s and all of his brothers died in their 30s/40s from heart disease. Prostate cancer on paternal side of family (father, grandfather, 2 uncles affected), breast cancer for paternal grandmother. However, 23andMe claims I have no tested genetic risk factors for stroke or breast cancer (that were tested for). I'm wary about hormonal birth control after my own experience withdrawing from the pill (acne, libido changes, greasy everything), and reading about people's experiences with them. As someone who's sort of on the anxious side and has undiagnosed dermatillomania, I'm concerned about anxiety and depression as reported side effects, as well as acne, which triggers my skin picking. When I first tried the pill years ago, I got sleep paralysis 4 times a night for a whole month. I also experienced 2 migraines with aura last spring, and know that hormonal birth control can cause migraines. I have also read that hormonal birth control can interfere with the ability to build muscle, and one study showing that hormonal birth control may have long-term and effects on your libido even after ceasing use. These studies were on pill users, but there hasn't really been any long term studies about the Mirena use, so I feel like there is incomplete knowledge on the full effects on your body long-term. I know mirena is supposedly mostly locally acting, but with side effects like acne and depression listed, that seems contradictory to me. I also just don't like the idea of treating a body non-stop for a problem that comes for a few days once a month. On the other hand, NSAIDs have their own long list of side effects, particularly for long-term use. My periods are a little hard to predict, and since I am supposed to take NSAIDs starting a few days in advance of my period, it means that I end up taking heavy doses for about a week, sometimes more. For a 34ish day cycle, it seems like an awfully large proportion of my life to spend taking a lot of NSAIDS. I have a tendency to get acid reflux, and GERD runs in my family, though I don't think I have it yet. Before my doctor suggested switching to naproxen, I was taking 1200-2000mg of ibuprofen every day for a week, and occasionally supplementing with vicodin leftover from a previous surgery. None of this ever really helped with the pain. I've been taking 440-660mg naproxen sodium for the last week, the first time I've tried using naproxen for my menstrual cramps. It seems to be reducing my cramps (though it may be a coincidence), but after being on it a week so far, I find I'm waking up with acid reflux. What's going to happen if I'm doing this to my body every month? I am wondering if maybe my aversion to being on hormones and embracing NSAIDs could actually be worse for my health? Particularly on the chance that I have endometriosis, am I taking a risk letting that go? Of course, OB also recommends against the surgery for diagnosis, so I don't know for sure that I have it. I wish there were a clear answer as to what action I should be taking for my health. What is your professional opinion? Thanks!"	AskDocs
Stacks to help me become an Independent, Functional Adult?	I never realised how stupid I was until my younger brother started accomplishing things that I wasn't able to at my age as he got older. I’m almost 25 and yet I still live with my mom, I haven’t got my license yet because I never feel like I’m mentally ready to start learning driving and I couldn’t handle community college or university because I lacked the motivation, persistence and mental energy to study. With the way I’m living right now, there’s a good chance that I’m going to stay dependent on my mother until I'm 40 or older. On the other hand, my younger brother is four years younger than me and his almost about to graduate from university and already has a license to drive anywhere he wants. So as you would've guessed, I constantly get compared to my younger brother by my parents and my co-workers and I get weird looks and seen as the “odd” sibling as if there's something is wrong with me. I'm aware that it’s quite common for siblings to differ in intelligence. But in our case, it’s not just a slight difference, but it’s a huge difference. And not only is there a huge difference, but I'm at the opposite end of the spectrum since I'm unable to take care of myself, thus I get treated like crap because of it. I don’t blame them though, because I can’t believe how stupid and dependent I am myself. I still remember what my dad told my younger brother several years ago when he thought I was sleeping, he said “don’t become like your brother, okay son?” which upset me inside as if I chose to turn out this way. I don’t know why I’ve turned out this stupid with so many physical and mental health problems, it’s probably just a unlucky genetic make up but it could be... * toxic chemicals I was exposed to growing up or in the womb * being deficient in iodine and omega-3 while in the womb which is said to dramatically reduce IQ in children when they're born my mom had told me that she stayed in Japan at her parents house surrounded by her friends and relatives and didn't have to work and ate lots of fish and vegetables cooked by her parents every day while she was pregnant with my younger brother. With me, she said she stayed in Sydney in a crappy small apartment away from social support in Japan and she said she was constantly stressed out due to being tight with money because of my dad's crappy job. So her main staple in her diet was meat and carbs and barely any seafoods or veggies. She was also apparantly smoking until she realised that she was pregnant with me. But she had already quit smoking for good by the time she was preggo with my younger brother * bunch of medications I was given when I was hospitalized twice for my asthma attack when I was 10 years old * hitting my head on the ground and fracturing my collarbone during soccer when I was 15 years old * being prescribed 200mg minocycline for 6 months for my acne when I was 19 (before I've developed gut issues) * abusing caffeine when it stopped working when I was starting falling behind in community college (caffeine is said to inhibit hippocampal dependent learning) * gut issues I've developed when I turned 21 (ironically 2 years after minocycline) * having been under general anaesthesia twice when I was 21 for rectal surgery and colonoscopy severe side effects from five days on roaccutane and some mental side effects still persisting even after 6 months * possible hypothyroid * mitochondrial dysfunction * neurological problems(dopamine/serotonin deficiency/ADD) * other reasons that I'm not aware of Whatever the reason, since I’m in this situation, I need to figure out how to get out of it. Otherwise, I’m going to become a 40 year old man who still lives with his single mom(my parents got divorced after my dad came out of the closet when I was 15). At the very least, I need to be able to live on my own and find my own job because my mom is fed up with taking care of me and she constantly threatens to kick me out of her house because I'm not contributing to anything. What probably has worsened my cognition further is that I’ve developed Rectal prolapse, IBS-C, Elongated/Redundant, floppy, thin colon, Slow-colonic transit, Fecal impaction, Gastritis and Acid reflux/GERD when I turned 21 in 2012. I believe I’ve developed these conditions because I was unable to cope with the stress in my life which ironically was caused by my lack of intelligence to overcome the stressor. Long story short, my rectal prolapse have been repaired through surgery and my IBS-C had got better over the years. But unfortunately, most of my other gut issues like Slow-colonic transit, Elongated/Redundant, floppy, thin colon and Acid reflux/GERD are chronic conditions which cannot be fixed and my overall gut health has never been the same since and it will probably be never the same. Besides the health issues that I’ve mentioned, I’ve wondered if I have other undiagnosed health problems that could be affecting my cognition. So I’ve started researching common diseases that affects people's cognition. These are the tests I've had done so far: * Full blood count test - 2014 * S-Thyroid function test (Free T4 &amp; TSH) - 2014 * Culmulative S-Thyroid function test (only TSH) - 2012 * Iron studies - 2014 * S-Magnesium, S-E/LFT - 2014 * Celiac disease test - 2013 * Colonocopy &amp; CT scan report - 2013 Alhoutgh my Free T4 and TSH levels were within range, I’ve heard that you can still have thyroid issues even if it’s in the 'range' because the 'range' is mostly used by people who are already hypo/hyperthyroid, so my thyroid levels may not be in the optimal range for my own body. But how am I supposed to prove to my doctor that I have thyroid issues if my thyroids are in range? The reason why I suspected that I had thyroid issue was because my right hand has become chronically dry since my 20’s, but this could just be from eczema though. I've also developed Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome in my 20’s so now I can’t fall asleep until 3 - 5 am and can't wake up naturally until 11am - 1pm. I’ve managed to fix my sleep pattern a few times but it always goes back to the same, delayed sleep pattern over time so I’ve given up on trying to fix my sleep and I work my life around it. I hate to say it but I'm heavily dependent on caffeine to function daily. Drinking coffee seems to help me deal with the stress, anxiety, depression and lack of mental energy. I’ve tried quitting coffee so many times, but I always find myself becoming depressed, fatigued and slow-minded even after I overcome the 4 weeks of withdraw phase. So I eventually had to go back to drinking coffee daily to be able to function. I’ve already optimised my lifestyle and diet by eating whole veggies and drinking juiced vegetables, taking fish oil, Vitamin D3 and going to the gym as often as I can. But even that doesn’t seem to be enough for me to start becoming an independent, functional adult. I've lost hope on getting help from the doctor since whenever I desperately go seek help for my mental issues, they always say there's nothing wrong with me and just sends me home. So I feel like my only other option is to keep taking bunch of nootropics/supplements until I find what works for me. Can anyone tell me which supplements/nootropics I should take in order to become an independent, functional adult who can learn to drive a car, find his own job and live on his own?	StackAdvice

The Story Behind the Ham	"Long time lurker, first (and only) time poster. I would like to tell you folks how I came to be involved in the HAES movement. I've always been overweight, but I've never quite gotten into the morbidly obese category. I am female, and, since I was about 18, I've hovered between 200 and 210 lbs at 6'0"". Before, I weighed slightly less. I've been fat my whole life, but, except for one 6 month period, I have always believed that my extra weight stems from my sedentary lifestyle and my overeating and eating junk food. I stress eat, and I eat to cope with just about every emotion. I know I do it, and have tried to curb the habit, but haven't gotten very far. Honestly, I have never had the willpower to stop. It's not doing my body any favors, and I know it, but that's besides the point for now. When I started college, I was happy. I had a stable job, found a stable boyfriend (who is now my stable fiance), was doing well in all of my classes, and was involved on campus and off campus. But then I started not feeling quite as great. I got tired all the time. Seriously tired. I felt like I had been hit by a bus some afternoons. I distinctly remember being so tired it physically hurt me to stay awake, but I didn't have the energy to move from my desk chair to my lofted bed, so I stayed upright crying silently while fading in and out of sleeping and waking. It scared me shitless, but I didn't have insurance, and all the campus nurse said was to get more sleep. I was getting 8 hours a night. That was the best I could do. I started having other symptoms. My back and neck hurt a lot. But eh, I was fat. Carrying around 60 extra pounds can lead to back pain. Whatever. I felt like I was being squeezed in my chest constantly. Eh, probably the fat making me uncomfortable... I could fix that, if I tried. My legs started tingling from time to time. Weird man. Eventually, the tingling would morph into numbness. Then, later, the tingling would generally turn to numbness or to intense burning or itching. This numbness and tingling led me to secretly start worrying about diabetes. A worry that got worse when my vision started getting super blurry in my left eye. I had made an appointment with a doctor, but it was a few weeks out yet when something happened and I moved my appointment up. I bent my head in class one day and it felt like my spine was being electrocuted. I made a horrible noise because I was shocked and it had frickin HURT. Some of you may have guessed, but I have MS. Funny thing is, even with many of the classic symptoms like Lhermitte's Sign, the MS hug, blurred vision and pain in one eye, and eventually trigeminal neuralgia, the doctor that I went to originally only checked my blood sugar, then wrote my symptoms off as weight-related when my blood sugar levels were normal. I was given a lectured about losing weight, and I was sent home. I was somewhat devastated that symptoms I thought were serious were apparently not worrisome, and I didn't quite believe that it was all fat-related. I started to try to change my ways, but I didn't get far. I was losing weight, but it was more from not having the energy to eat and the trigeminal neuralgia (I didn't know what it was at the time but it seriously upset me) would get set off sometimes just from chewing. I went back to the doctor, was congratulated for my weight loss, told to continue, and sent back home with all of my symptoms. The third time I went back, she discussed it possibly being due to fibromyalgia, or being some sort of psychic pain. I was a mess. This all happened over about a 2 month time period. Then I started feeling better. I thought it was, actually the weight. (I was down from 210 to 175 at this point.) That is, until a few months later, when the symptoms came back with a vengeance. I started wetting myself. I took a tumble down a flight of stairs because I couldn't feel my legs well enough to walk properly. Because I fell at work, my boss hauled my ass to the hospital and I was given a CT scan. I mentioned that I couldn't feel my legs very well to the ER doc, but explained that I had been losing weight so it shouldn't be an issue much longer. (I was kind of dumb.) The ER doc immediately listened more intently than my other doc ever had, and after describing my symptoms, I got myself a lumbar puncture and an MRI. Some other tests too probably. Yep. MS. This is where my tale takes a strange turn. I had finally had a doctor validate all of my symptoms, tell me that I really was sick and it probably wasn't because I weighed 200 lbs when my symptoms started, and even give the other doctor the side eye for not knowing some classic signs of MS. So obviously, I decided to reject the diagnosis of MS, join up with the HAES cause, and just generally jump straight off the deep end into the pool of lard. Someone in the movement convinced me that the doctors were trying to convince me I needed treatments I shouldn't have because they were fat-phobic and even a ""smallfat"" such as myself would face discrimination. I started drinking my calories. I couldn't eat very well, so I drank pop and milkshakes and whatnot. Gotta keep my sugars up so I won't feel sick. Looking back, I'm cringing and can't even finish listing all the bullshit I started believing in such a short period of time. I can't explain why I got into it either. I was told all my symptoms were fat related at first, and accepted that. I was diagnosed with MS later, and freaked out and joined up with the Lard Brigade. To be fair, I was freaking the fuck out as soon as I heard MS. To make it worse, I was uninsured, already looking at massive hospital bills, and not liking the words like ""disability"" and ""chronic pain management"" and ""wheelchair"" and ""brain lesions"" and ""incurable."" It's not a fun diagnosis. In addition, to a degree, I felt as though I brought it on myself. When I was sick but undiagnosed, I felt, somewhere inside, that my life would be easier if I had a diagnosed disease. I wished that I could get excused absences from classes because of a disability. I wished I could take time off of work and school when I was so tired I was falling asleep and crying because I was so tired, rather than just feeling lazy. I wished that I would be told that there was a valid reason for feeling the way I did, other than being fat. I think part of that was not wanting to take full accountability for myself, but another part of me thinks that I knew that some of this stuff wasn't weight related. I don't know what I'm trying to say here exactly. I want people to be aware of the situations some of us fatties have been in that lead us to thinking messed up shit like ""man, I wish I had a REAL disability."" It sounds messed up to me now, and it did to me back when I was thinking it. I dunno. Some doctors really are fairly anti-fat, and even when they're professional about it, it's obvious when you're being treated with disdain, and when doctors have diagnosed you before you've even opened your mouth. Obviously this doesn't only happen to fat people, but it does happen. It happened to me. It was just one bad doctor really, but I can understand how that could lead someone to shun doctors. I know part of my problem was, and is, not wanting to take responsibility for my own actions. But I don't think that's the only thing going on in the HAES community. Being told that you're killing yourself with something that you love (eating), or something that you do compulsively to help you get through the day is scary. Food is my crutch. I'm getting my life under control again, but eating my worries away is still a thing for me. I can't go out in the same ways that I used to, especially when I'm having a relapse. I can still eat a delicious milkshake though. I dunno. I still don't know what I'm talking about. I guess I'm trying to explain that many of us hams joined the movement because we're scared? Or feel unaccepted? Or because we just want to feel like our feelings are valid. To me, TiTP was kind of similar to FPS and fatlogic and fat people hate. Some of it is just ignorant bullshit, some of it is obvious exaggeration, but at the heart, it's just groups of people who have been wronged by other groups of people. Obviously, TiTP has many shortcomings and is generally obnoxious, hateful, misinformed nonsense, but generally the people on there, I've learned, have been genuinely mistreated a few times, or are just scared and hate themselves. It might seem outlandish, to hear some of the things people say. Some of it is bullshit, through and through, but sometimes, you really need to think about why people are talking the way they are. Again, not everyone needs to be looked at with an empathetic mind. If someone's being hateful or willfully ignorant, go ahead and call them an asshole. That's fine by me. But sometimes, sometimes you need to look deeper. Looking at others with empathy is a good thing, and frankly, I think some people need to do it more often. TL;DR: Was diagnosed as fat. Didn't join HAES. Turns out I was misdiagnosed, have MS. Joined HAES. Emotional rambling with no point."	fatpeoplestories
DNA sequencing showed showed a high risk of celiac disease, need help deciding what to do next	"Hi, So I got my DNA sequenced through 23andMe, all seemed fine in their health overview - but when I ran the raw sequence through a 3rd party service that analyses more markers (Promethease) it came up with a few hits indicating celiac disease. Including: ""Single HLA-DQ8 haplotype"" (rs7454108(C;T)), ""increased risk for celiac disease"" (rs3184504(T;T)) So I'm beginning to worry. For about a decade, possibly more (I'm 23) I've had a bad stomach approximately 2-3 times a week, never pinned down what was causing it or had it bad enough to seek medical advice. My dad's cut out white bread from his diet to get rid of a constant heartburn that's been affecting him. I'm currently still in the ""ahhhh!"" stage, so if you could help me understand how important it would be to actually see a doctor with these results? I'm equally scared of leaving it undiagnosed and doing more damage and finding out what damage has been done already, plus having to care a more about how I eat (since I'm a vegetarian already who basically only knows how to make pasta and toast, loves pizza and sandwiches)"	Celiac
Recently diagnosed with endometriosis	So I've been recently diagnosed with endometriosis and I'm going to start treatment with the Lupron Depot shot next week. Along with an already 0% sex drive from hormonal birth control pills/undiagnosed painful sex I'm wondering how other women have dealt with this diagnosis and if the urge to have sex comes back? My 2 year relationship is in a pretty bad place, exasperated by hardly any sex. I'm literally repulsed by the thought of sex even though I find my SO attractive. We've had other relationship problems though so it's not 100% endometriosis' fault. Anyway any support/light at the end of the tunnel advice would be greatly appreciated, I'm tired of being depressed and scared of this disease!	TwoXChromosomes
I need some advice, ladies	Regular BrMo-er, using a throwaway because I'm a coward. I don't even know where to start. Okay. So, I have a problem with my DH watching porn. I'm not entirely sure why. Ive watched it with exes with no jealousy issues. But something about my husband watching it just... fucking stings. I used to be much, much bigger than I am now. Its taken me a few years, but I've lost a substantial amount of weight. I got big after the birth of my child, and along with me overeating and some undiagnosed medical issues, I was close to 300 pounds. I worked my ass off to get to a healthy weight, get my disease under control, and lost over 100 pounds. I've always had a problem with him watching porn though. Even early in our relationship when I was tiny, wispy waisted. We've talked about it, Id pour my heart out, and hes said that it doesn't mean anything to him. That he doesn't need to watch it. Which has led to him essentially lying about viewing it, hiding it, or blatantly ignoring my feelings about it. I can't tell you how many times I've been jolted awake by him masturbating to the porn on r/all in the bed next to me while he thinks I'm asleep. When it happens, I lay there in complete disbelief at the audacity of his actions, paralyzed with sadness. He thinks hes slick, but I do the laundry. I clean the clothes he wipes his dick and hands off on when hes finished. I'm so fucking hurt. I'm ashamed of the way I look. I don't have big tits like he'd prefer. I'm not the hair color he prefers. I feel completely useless. I work out every single day. I breastfed my child, so my breasts are nowhere near their pre-child glory days. My stomach has stretch marks from bearing his child. I don't look like the women he looks at while he jerks off. I never will and it would take tens of thousands of dollars for that to even be a possibility. We have an active sex life. But I can't help but think that hes thinking of them when we have sex. He always fucks with his eyes closed and doesn't kiss me anymore. When I try to discuss it rationally, he accuses me of looking for shit to be angry about. He asks me if I really think that little of him. I feel like hes gas lighting me. Recently I found out that hes been looking at the hotwife sub. That made me cry. When he went to work the morning after I found out, I cried (no exaggeration) the entire day. I know all about fantasies. I've been submissive my entire life. He knew this when we met. Hes tried to fulfill some of my fantasies. When asked about his, he tells me he doesn't have any. I've tried to pry it out of him, but he insists he doesn't have any. Aside from this, we have a good marriage. Its just his complete lack of fucking empathy that's killing me here. I'm broken, girls. Thoroughly. Fucking. Shattered. Can you please give me some advice? Perspective? Please be honest. Am I being irrational?	breakingmom
TIFU by crying in my bosses office.	"TIFU by crying in my bosses office. A little back story.I'm a dude working in a 95% female environment in the health care field. 3 years ago I became ill with crohns disease that went undiagnosed for 3 months and about killed me, 2 months into my year long recovery my girlfriend of 4 years tells me I am no fun any more and walks out. 6 months after that I loose my job due to ""slow performance and poor attitude"". This causes me to not be able to pay rent of my student loans and I have to move back in with my folks. I go unemployed for a year in my field and scrape by with service industry work trying to pay my medical debt. Finally landing a full time weekend position in a local hospital by sheer luck . My manager asks to see me for a second. He is the only other dude in my department. We get to talking about how stressed I have become and how people can tell. I have already been having issues with coworkers saying I'm defensive. I'm defensive because the 2 coworkers I have on the weekends have worked together for years and hold hands for simple stuff and leave things they don't want for me. They constantly step on my toes during exams and nit pick my work when they do help. This really undermines my confidence leading me to worry about my job stability. He starts cornering me about what is going on. I have been compartmentalizing this frustration for months. I just break down in front of him. Not loudly sobbing but clearly crying. I regain my composure after a few minutes. The guy has only been working there 6 weeks and probably thinks I'm an unstable freak. I have no idea what to do. If I loose this job I fear I might become suicidal again. I have spent the last 2 years rebuilding my life and I don't know if I can handle it again."	tifu
Anyone else raising a kid after dealing with loss in the family? I'm scared sick over it.	I have two younger siblings who passed away during infancy (at 5 months and 2 months, respectively). We're still not entirely sure why except that it may have something to do with an undiagnosed mitochondrial disease that I may or may not also have or at least be a carrier for (and mito stuff is passed down through the mother). Great. So on top of being a FTM, I'm constantly terrified that I'm just going to find my baby dead one of these days... She's doing really well and seems to be healthy so far, but it's causing me a lot of anxiety. Like, I've had a breakdown over it every day since she was born. I'm already on meds for GAD but it's just so much to deal with on top of everything else postpartum. My mom, who has some PTSD from it all on top of an anxious personality, has been here helping out, and she's handling everything better than expected but is also (understandably) pretty nervous about every little thing that could potentially be wrong with my baby. And that's making me paranoid. I appreciate the extra eyes, especially from someone more experienced at this than me, but I dunno... I especially worry because J is such a calm and content baby— which is great! But if she did stop breathing or something I'm scared I wouldn't notice. At least when she's crying I know she's alive. Anyway. I don't know what I'm looking for here except maybe some company, or at least an outlet. Thanks for letting me vent at you. *** **Edit:** My mom helped talk me down some. I forget that she had to learn how to deal with the anxiety too, so she helped put things in perspective for me. I'm still scared but I think I'll be okay.	beyondthebump
Is there a canine cardiologist in here, by any chance?	"I offered to take in a dog as basically a hospice case. Here is his story: (From a fellow rescuer in Nacodoches) &gt;His name is Gentle Ben. He has been wandering the streets of Timpson, a small community in the sticks outside of Nac, for at least a year. Put together all the parts of a Pyrenees we love and you have Ben. He is tall, VERY skinny - at 102 lbs he could stand to gain another 30 or so. He is oh so gentle with everyone. He is a leaner, loves to be loved on and I imagine he hasn't had much loving since he is a bit - aromatic. Gives a great Pyr Paw, puts that big ole mitt right in your hand and gazes at you. This boy is a lover. &gt;He also has a long list of things wrong with him: &gt;Ear and eye infections that are clearing up and he is starting to be able to hear again. &gt;Skin infection that looks like mange but skin scrapings reveal no mites and he smells like yeast gone wild. &gt;An old break in one leg that he has learned to live with. He has tested positive for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Lyme disease. &gt;And the kicker - he has a heart problem that is likely to kill him in a few months. &gt;That last one is the one I want to talk to you about. I would love for Gentle Ben to have a soft spot for him to be for his time on earth that he has left. He is only 3 yrs old but has the heart of a stogie smoking dog. His heart is breaking from so much unrequited love that it hurts him inside. &gt;He is low HW+ but that can be dealt with and it is not what is damaging his heart. &gt;He has been at a local vets office for about a week and is improving. But he can't live there. and if no one steps up for him he will likely have to be euthanized there. &gt;He deserves better. &gt;I can send you the vet's cardiology report if you are interested. I am about as close to begging as I ever have been. This guy is special. These pictures are from a week ago. Doc says he has improved some since then. Here are the pictures that I was sent of him last night. Imgur isn't cooperating with me, so instead of doing a regular album, you are going to have to click for ""first image"", ""second image, and ""third image"". http://imgur.com/3JMaC34,k48ksR1,imRsWKl[1] I am hoping to find a small animal cardiologist that might be willing to donate some time, and perhaps tell us how we can extend his time left. One of the rescues that I volunteer with has said he could be considered one of theirs, but they are low on funds at the moment. I am sure the rescue would be willing to sign a waiver, stating that you are in no way responsibie for any bad results, all he's had so far is a lifetime of bad results. I just want to give this poor boy as much quality time as possible, and to keep him as comfortable as possible, for what time he has left. I suspect that the Lyme disease is the reason for the heart issues. I don't know if that helps or not. He probably went undiagnosed and untreated for a long time after he caught that. (and I had originally posted this in /r/dogs, and someone made the wonderful suggestion that I post it in here.)"	AskVet

Think I might have lupus or an autoimmune disease, going to the doc next week. Any reccomendations?	So I always hear stories of people getting undiagnosed for years and I'm curious what to look or ask for when I see my doctor, I've heard this disease is very rare in males. I'll start with my symptoms. I'm 31 now and have had stomach issues for about 8 years. I chalked a lot of this up to drinking all the time and being hungover. I've slowed the drinking down though and they still persist ranging from nausea to pain, lack of apetite, bowl pain and occasional diarrhea. I went in for severe pain a few months ago and was diagnosed with gastritis, although I was drinking heavily over the holidays. I recently had an endoscopy though and had multiple biopsies that came up negative, my prognosis from that doctor was GERD. Fatigue has always been an issue, I find myself feeling lazy, often unable to function at work after 4 or 5 hours, and I nap when I get home. The other side of this is I'm also a night owl, i don't sleep very well unless I'm extremely exhausted which usually finds me up late. I toss when I sleep and have restless leg syndrome and can't sleep without a pillow between my legs. A couple months ago I had major back pain all over and went to a masseuse, she said my back was tight everywhere. it died down after a couple weeks and it was unnoticeable. I chalked that one up to work as i have to spend a fair amount of time standing over a workbench. About 6 months ago I had a severe joint flare up in my ankles and wrists and knees which I thought was really weird. I would get up in the middle of the night and not be able to walk they were so stiff, I just put them in a hot bath to get some relief. That went away after a few weeks, blood work was normal although my inflammation markers were high. Doc said it was probably a viral. My recent and most scary symptoms started after the gastritis diagnosis. I start feeling flushed in my face and arms and upper chest. Sometimes it's not that noticeable as i kind of have a permanently reddish nose, I'm Irish English descent. Sometimes I get what looks to me like the butterfly rash and my gf agrees. My eyes tend to look baggy and white compared to my face, and they also tend to get itchy and dry. The flushing bothers me a lot. It feels like my face is sunburnt bad, just that radiating heat feeling, and it makes me extremely tired and disoriented, lights look weird and it's almost a slightly dizzying effect when it's happening. It can last for up to 6+ hours sometimes. I also just have feeling of terror or uneasiness in my chest that I can't shake and I'm not sure if that's me just stressing out from not knowing what's happening to me. Also my feet and hands get cold and calm my when I'm not active, sometimes I can hear my heart thunder in my ears when I lay down. Anyways I just thought maybe some of you could point me in the right direction, it seems the symptoms of this disease are extremely variable and I feel like my doctors aren't taking me as seriously as i want. Not trying to diagnose myself really, though I am a medical scientist and this seems to be the direction my symptoms point me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	lupus
At what age do you tell your undiagnosed children about your day-to-day as a T1?	Was wondering when you T1's told your children about the intracacies of the disease. Right now, my 5 yr. old just knows my pump and CGM as my 'medicine'. He is not diagnosed...just me. I told him that if I'm ever sleeping and can't wake up to go to the neighbors house...hopefully he'll remember :) But other than that, I keep him somewhat in the dark.	diabetes

Anyone with Lyme get a tattoo during/after their illness? Did anything negative happen?	"Hi fellow Lymies, me in a nutshell: contracted lyme and several co-infections when i was 11 or 12 years old; went undiagnosed for 12 years and so now the disease runs my life. The best I can hope is for it to ease off and go into a ""remission"" state. LLMD is amazing, I wish I got to meet them when I was still a child instead of a grown adult. Anyways, title says it all. Have any of you gotten a tattoo while you've had Lyme? I've heard that if you've got the disease in ""remission"", getting a tattoo can basically reactivate everything. People sometimes need to get back on Doxy, too. What about getting a tattoo during your less severe stages of treatment? Any experiences? I've wanted two specific tattoos for the last several years. However, I'm afraid that I may never get them because of Lyme :-/ Cheers Everyone"	Lyme

[NSV] Fit into my size 40 pants again!	I started Keto last year and dropped 3 waist-sizes and nearly 70 lbs; however, I learned that much of the loss was due to undiagnosed Crohn's disease. I was diagnosed, treated with steroids and advised off of Keto until my gut healed. (I was bleeding out in my large intestine, and suffering from undernourishment due to malabsorption.) Gained thirty Lbs. back from the steroids before I kicked them and started Humira. I was scared to go back on low carbs until this winter, after I was in full remission. I'm now working out five days a week and eating right. I've turned a lot of fat into muscle and am losing again. This time, it's not the Chron's! Thanks r/Keto!	keto
Infected leg wound because of injection.	"I'm a throw away because I don't really want this on my main account. Anyway, I'm a female in my mid twenties with Addison's disease, hypothyroidism and some kind of undiagnosed gynae issue. Anyway, for the past 7 months I have been nauseated and vomiting pretty much every day and have been prescribed cyclizine lactate injections to administer im. However, during one night of not being able to stop vomiting I decided to see if it would be more effective to try and do iv, which I've done twice before successfully, however my veins are completely rubbish. I couldn't find any veins anywhere except one in the outside of my lower leg, the cyclizine extravasated and now I have a huge hole in my leg which doesn't appear to be healing. This was around 6 weeks ago, and until now it didn't appear to be infected, I was dressing it everyday and have removed all the dead skin and applied antiseptic cream. However, tonight when I looked it looked red around the site and swollen, I decided to squeeze it gently and a lot of clear liquid and blood came out with what appeared to be oil in it too. So I've cleaned it and dressed it and taken some clarithromycin I havld been prescribed before, however I only have 3 left. I really really don't want to go to the doctors because if they realise what I've done they'll stop the cyclizine script and I'll have no quality of life whatsoever.

"No Fap journal entry: Motivated by ""Suffer the pain of discipline"""	"Fluffwalrus recently posted the quote ""Suffer the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret"" and it motivated me to re-join NoFap. It was good food for thought just as a quote, but after dwelling on it for a few days I found deeper personal meaning within it. For over two years I have been enjoying some kind of undiagnosed inflammation to my nervous system, possibly an autoimmune disease or disorder. Too many symptoms for discussion here, but one of them is Trigeminal Neuralgia (look it up... nicknamed The Suicide Diease). Indeed I find TM is painfull but for me it only affects the specific nerve in my face that it's named for. Compared to the whole body, all-over neuropathic pain that I otherwise get, TM's not that big of a deal. About six weeks ago my thumb accidently found it's way into the table saw blade at work. Pain? Oh yeah lots of it, but again nothing compared to having nerve pain throughout my whole body. Did I fap with a big old bleeding bandage on my thumb? Yes (pa-thet-ic). I'm no stranger to pain, I think about it and my situation a lot. So ""Suffering the pain of disipline..."" while NoFapping seems like nothing compared to the real thing. Anyway, that's the big motivator for me right now."	NoFap
My [25F] girlfriend [34F] of 4 years is taking corticosteroids and her body changed a lot. It's been a year and a half I feel frustrated. tried to talk to her about it and it didn't work out.	Okay guys. It's the first time i seek for help in here. I know how you can be gentle and then i thought i should give it a try. So... here's my problem. I have a girlfriend who has an undiagnosed autoimmune disease which causes most of her body hair fall. She almost doesnt have hair on her arms, legs, her eyebrows are very thin and her hair started to fall a lot, like an allopecia. This happens to her since 2000 as far as i know. Recently (dec 2013), she's been trying corticosteroids (swallowing and injecting directly on her head where the hair is falling) to prevent it from happening. Her eyebrows started to grow again and are beautiful, but her hair didn't really change much. Oh, i forgot to mention she uses a prothesis so people wont notice her lack of hair and stuff. Corticosteroids have a shit ton of collateral effects, but what's been bothering me is the Cushing Syndrome. She gained about 8kg, her face turned round, she developed the buffalo hump, her skin became fragile. Her clothes just doesnt fit properly right now. All this plus all the other side effects, like cramps all over her body and muscle wasting, diabetis, osteoporosis etc which scares me a LOT. She's been taking those meds for about a year and a half without a pause, and i dont really trust her doctor, who didn't even tell her to do an eye examination, since she has a probability of losing her sight due to the corticosteroids if she doesnt check it up with some frequence. We've been together for almost 4 years and yesterday i kind of had a breakdown. I said i wanted her the way she was, even if it meant with less hair. For me, since she uses a prothesis it doesn't really change anything visually speaking (but i don't really care if she is with a prothesis or not). I told her i wasnt seeing any big differences that compensate all the side effects and she didn't handle it well. Long story short, today i told her i was harsh and asked for apologies. I told her i loved her and she told me she doesn't believe me anymore. I wanted to know what you guys would do in my place. I think i was selfish yesterday, but at the same time she didn't do much to prevent those symptoms and this really frustrates me. I've been on her side since the beggining of her treatment but i just can't seem to make her realize that it doesnt actually work the way she wanted. And i do love her, but i can't deny those symptoms really gets me down. **tl;dr**: Got a girlfriend of 4 years taking corticosteroids and she changed a lot (physically). I tried to make her understand my point of view and it didn't end well. What should i do?	relationships
PCOS, extreme PMS, and a mystery disease/illness	"Hi everyone :) I have a question mainly regarding PMS, but also if anyone can help me out with the undiagnosed thing (I'll put [***] next to that part) that would be AMAZING! So first, some background info (it's a bit of a long one, sorry!) I'm 19 and I was formally diagnosed with PCOS last year just after my mum was. I'd been having crippling ovary-area pain to the point where I was reduced to the floor at work unable to get up and I had to get some family to pick me up from work. I saw a doctor that day who brushed it off as kidney stones, but after a while I finally saw someone who referred me to a PCOS specialist/gynaecologist. Soon after (the day after seeing the specialist actually) I was in the hospital for surgery (mid-Feb 2015) where he discovered extensive endometriosis as well as the cysts. The endo was adhered to weird places and it was actually suspending my bowel, with my bowel kinked in the air sort-of-thing. I ended up having a laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, a /something/ biopsy and the endo removed. Since the surgery the ovary pain is gone and even the majority of my chronic back pain (the gyno said that the endo probably caused that) but I still get the other PCOS symptoms such as constant weight issues, no period at all, scalp and back acne, greasy hair, I'm always really really hot even when it's cold etc etc. It might be helpful to know that I also have juvenile idiopathic arthritis, had ganglions surgically removed, steroid injections, chronic pain, history of depression and severe anxiety, general body hyper-elasticity, meniscus tear, I've had my ankle reconstructed, and I'm quite short (152cm) which is sometimes relevant. [***] Also I should add in here: something that is so far undiagnosed despite many blood tests and even Coeliac's disease tests, with every single test coming back as normal. I'm getting symptoms including nausea, very sudden vomiting, frequent mouth ulcers, sudden unexplained weight loss (usually incredibly difficult even when trying), gastrointestinal issues, sudden almost fainting, tunnel vision, head spins, easy bruising, fatigue, some hyperpigmentation, and a few other things which have escaped my memory for now. These symptoms have kept me home from university and forced me to run off of a train to throw up in a bin and nearly faint a few times. Note: my blood pressure is perfect. I've been instructed to get a brain scan for the undiagnosed thing since the blood work is coming up with absolutely nothing, and I'm currently taking Lexapro, Ritalin, Plaquenil and Metformin. Since I never get my period I have also been prescribed Provera by the gyno with instructions to take it every 3 months for 7 days to ""force a bleed"" so the endometriosis won't build up again. The gyno said don't be worried if I don't actually bleed though, apparently it isn't necessary and may not happen, the point is that I reset the cycle. I had been on 'The Pill' which masked (in a bad way) the PCOS so I'm not meant to touch those anymore. Also, there is 0% chance that I could be pregnant. Sooooo finally the PMS. The past few weeks I have been experiencing raging PMS. I'm talking - my arms are literally shaking with rage, I am enraged by absolutely everything and I feel incredibly violent. It is extremely rare that I get PMS at all, which since I don't 'M' I guess I can't really PMS. If someone ticks me off I feel like I'm close to beating them and not being able to stop. I have not had my period, nor experienced any signs that it's going to come. I have never experienced PMS this insanely intense before, even before the PCOS got bad. The PMS isn't every day and there seems to be a faint pattern around when I see a certain someone who royally ticks me off, but that just amplifies it, it doesn't bring it on. So apart from that there is no pattern. I'm not PMSing every day but when I am I have absolutely zero patience, I can't even pretend to be nice, I feel very violent and it's gotten to the point where I'm worried I will actually physically lash out at someone. Does anyone have any ideas, anything at all they think might help? I seriously need advice about this PMS; it's getting worrying. Also if anyone has any suggestions regarding the undiagnosed thing that would be very very much appreciated! Thank you so much for taking the time to read this :)"	PCOS
My brother is a douche and defended while the older siblings are wrong.	I'm 19 and the middle child of five kids (13,16,19,20,23) anyway when I was 15 I had a math final I passed out around 20 minutes before the exam because I had undiagnosed blood disease. My little GC brother (Douche) who is now 16 has it too but while I control it by regularly sleeping, and taking multivitamins, Douche milks it. So recently I bought some herbal pills to focus and once Douche found them, he stole them and then begged my mom for more. The reason I didnt have them was that there was a bad side effect which is expressed only with a certain blood disease. So anyway I warn him and he continues to take them. Ends up in hospital and my mom finds out and blames me for having poison in my room. Now that you understand that Douche is a sniveling, thieving POS. We have a few problems with him with mobile phones. (Note that I work to buy all my stuff, he gets government funding and wastes it so my parents pay for his shit) So my dad's birthday was coming up and my older brother Shylo bought an Iphone 5 secondhand. So Douche knows that Shylo has an iphone 5 for dad and Douche thinks he is a technological genius so without tell me or my brother Douche opens up the IPhone, breaks something, puts it back together but now the main button doesnt work. I find out and tell Shylo who tells Douche off and demands he pay for either damages or whole phone cost. Instead Douche whines to our Mom and she blames me and Shylo for giving him the temptation to do it and doesn't pay up. So we were pissed. Yesterday was my Dad's birthday and both me and Shylo chipped in and bought a new IPhone 5S sim free but today we find out that Douche hooked it up to a computer and changed the IOS my dad is used to and a lot of settings. So now my dad doesn't know how to use it (not a tech person). Shylo was pissed and beat the shit out of Douche as Douche kept talking back and saying he shouldnt have tempted Douche with a new phone while I ate toast, it was tasty. Furthermore my mom defended him yet again and said the same shit that he is ill (not really just cba getting out of bed) and she will now buy him a contract phone after she claimed she got shylo, me and my older sis one, not to crush on your parade mom but I buy my own phone and get a contract under my own name that I pay off with my savings from a bakery job. So I got blamed for not breaking up the fight and from an incident yesterday where I came back from work with some food as I had not eaten in the last in the last 28 hours he wanted some and I said no. So he came over grabbed my food and threw it in the bin so I have just ate the toast after 41 hours. To clarify the 1st IPhone was bought by Shylo but I paid to have it unlocked and the 2nd we both paid for it. Furthermore I dont eat home food because there is only junk food at home and my healthy stuff gets thrown out.	raisedbynarcissists
Sudden Weight Loss, Now Underwires Hurt	I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease 5 weeks ago and have lost about 10 pounds due to not only eating gluten-free, but needing a strict diet due to damage from the long undiagnosed disease. Now all the bras I was so thrilled to buy and wear, finally knowing my true size, hurt at the gore. I no longer have much fat there between skin and bone to cushion the underwires. Am I now relegated to soft cups, and if so can anyone recommend anything both comfortable and pretty? My two favorites have been Natori Feathers and Wacoal Embrace Lace Contour, but now they both hurt, and the Wacoal is too big. :(	ABraThatFits
Unmedicated, undiagnosed type 2…some questions.	"**UPDATE**: I think you guys hit me where it hurts--my intelligence. If a stupid person wouldn't go to the doctor for diabetes, and I'm not a stupid person, then I should go to the doctor for diabetes…or at least that's my post-hoc analysis. Either way, **I just got back from the doctor, and I got my blood drawn for a diabetes test.** Fortunately I hadn't eaten in the past ~12 hours, so that worked out well. I'll hear back about my results tomorrow. Thanks everyone, in a weird way, for revealing my stupidity. Long post… **The Past** So I've been skinny my whole life (5'9"" 125-130lbs), and in general I thought diabetes was a disease of obesity. If I wasn't overweight, I was fine. However, from high school to my third year of college (~6-7 years) I was eating a high-carb, highly processed diet and lived a pretty sedentary lifestyle. But I was skinny. During my third year of college I began to develop (unbeknownst to me) classic type 2 symptoms: excessive unquenchable thirst, excessive urination, and tingling in my hands and feet. I was completely ignorant about this. I didn't understand that these symptoms were related to diabetes, so I did nothing. I (fortuitously) decided to go on a ketogenic diet (unrelated to my above symptoms), as I began seeing around reddit the potential maladies associated with high carb intake. Since then, I had dropped my daily carb intake dramatically, but I'd freely indulge every now and then. It only became apparent to me a few months ago that my symptoms were likely indicative of diabetes. I had constant dry mouth and an occasional bout of excessive thirst, even on a relatively low carb diet. **The Present** I have been too afraid to go to a doctor. My whole family is pretty healthy. They're all relatively skinny like me. It would be very embarrassing. I also don't want the burden of having to check my blood sugar constantly, etc. *While I know it's irresponsible of me not go to see a doctor, I'm simply not in a place psychologically to go do that. Hopefully I will come around, for my sake.* Because I'm not (presently) seeking out a doctor's help, I've taken it upon myself to eat a low GI diet and exercise almost everyday. My diet now mainly consists of lots of vegetables (typically asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, spinach), chicken (sometimes other meat), cheese, occasionally some nuts, and olive oil. I avoid all carbs, although I will occasionally eat beans. Almost every day for the past 3 weeks I've gone running (or whatever fancy cardio machines the gym has). If I can't help but eat a cupcake at a social event, I immediately go running afterward. If I feel dry mouth coming on, I go running. After lunch or dinner, I go running. Exercise has become my diabetes medicine. My dry mouth has completely disappeared. My thirst is back to normal. No tingling. Regular urination. No *superficial* diabetes symptoms. (I know that the only way to truly know about my blood sugar is to test it directly.) **So my questions to you all: Is this sustainable? How irresponsible am I being? I welcome absolutely any advice.** ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- **TLDR**: Been skinny whole life, but ate poorly, no exercise. Developed diabetes symptoms (thirsty, urine, tingling), but didn't know what they were. Went on ketogenic diet randomly. Been having dry mouth a lot--put the pieces together: diabetes. Haven't seen a doctor, too afraid. I now eat a low GI diet, run almost every day. No apparent diabetes symptoms. Now see the questions above. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------"	diabetes

It works reasonably well but he still has small sores and is bald on his belly and down into the leg. And giving the liquid dose is not pleasant for anyone involved. And it's expensive, which would be fine if the drug worked exceptionally well.

anxiety, panic, feeling of someone/thing coming to *get* me, and physical illness in reaction to the death of my brother.	"Hi guys.~~I'll try to keep this relatively short.~~ (Didn't happen, I'm so sorry! Mods, feel free to dump my post if this is just too much, or not the sort of post that belongs here.) But I'm a talker, and I need to get this out. I've never ever felt like this before. This thing feels like a tumor with *fingers* all tangled around my guts. My youngest brother, let's call him Jarrod, was almost 59 when he died of cancer 2 weeks ago today. I am almost 52. I didn't know my brother all that well; didn't want to. He had all kinds of mental problems but was undiagnosed and untreated. Pretty unpleasant to be around. But I have lots of fun memories from our childhood. He was good to me back then. I idolized him then and I love him still. My deepest regret is that we couldn't remain close as he got older. He moved out of our house when he was 14 (I was 7). None of us saw him much after that (Parents and three brothers older than him. I am the baby and the only girl.) but whenever he came back around, his mental illness was a little bit worse. He had *out-there* ideas which became more and more *out-there* as he got older. He never physically harmed any of us, he just talked *incessantly* (seriously, it was a symptom with him) told the tallest, *wildest* tales, and was really insulting to anyone whose opinion was different than his. Which was everybody. He also took offence really easily, and seemed to assume, before even ""hello"", that everyone was out to hurt him. He would take offence at the most innocuous comment from someone, storm off in a huff, and disappear for weeks, months, or years, reappearing abruptly to spew vitriol and largely baseless accusations. As a result of his feeling of extreme superiority to everybody else, he began to isolate at a fairly early age. Nobody else was worth his time/attention. Over the years he went through three or 4 significant others/wives (that we know of) and had a son with one. At the time of his death he was living in a long term relationship. He was apparently very close with her, but he was estranged from his brothers and his son (29 yrs old) and very distant with my mom and myself. (Our dad died some years ago, of cancer, not coincidentally.) It was during the last of Jerrod's ""reappearances""- (via email. In those last few years he would never tell us exactly where he was, or come visit. We only had an email address and a PO Box by way of contact.) -that we learned he had cancer. Jarrod's death of throat cancer didn't have to happen. He had known about a lump on his neck (inflamed lymph node? tumor?) for several *years*. For about a dozen different reasons, most of them based in his mental illness (mistrust of doctors, authority figures, anybody who dared think themselves smarter than him) he didn't seek medical advice until he began to feel sick. By that time the doctors told him he needed his jaw, teeth, and much of his face and neck *removed*, followed by chemo and radiation, to have any chance of surviving. Jerrod was an insanely talented musician and singer. He didn't want to live without that. He didn't want to go through the agony of such radical surgery and protracted illness from chemo and radiation. If he survived, he might be alive, but would likely be terribly debilitated, unable to speak, swallow, taste, salivate, and worse still, unable to sing or play his beloved harmonica. (Throat cancer is EVIL and UGLY, people. We watched my oldest brother go through it, too. Before the cancer he was a total hottie and such a play-boy. He lived, but he's a frail little old man now. Don't use tobacco, or drugs, *please*. Don't engage in risky sexual behaviors, *please*. And see your doctor the *minute* you think something is amiss.) So Jerrod decided to let the cancer run its course and live as passionately as possible until he couldn't any more. He was able to do that for a couple of months. After that he was too ill to play gigs with his band, or work in his garden, or work on the old schoolhouse he and his SO had bought and begun to remodel. When he began to email us about his cancer, he told us that the medical profession was ""evil"" and ""barbaric"" and he refused to undergo conventional cancer treatment. Instead he would consult Chinese medicine practitioners. He told us about soaking his feet to remove the toxins in his body. He detailed the raw food diet he followed, and sent us links to the online stores where he bought essential oils to treat his headaches. We were livid. He hadn't told us his cancer was advanced. We thought he merely needed to have his tonsils out (he only told us about a tumor there) to kick this threat. We only learned the severity of his illness after he'd died. He wrote such passionate emails that we didn't really believe he was sick. For months we heard about his non-life threatening ills, and his ""natural"" ""cures"". We thought the cancer was just another of his tall tales. Then in early April we got an email from his SO. jerrod had been taken to the hospital with a severe hemmorhage. I'll skip the really gory details and just tell you he died about a month later, on May 1st. Mom, his brothers, and I were in absolute shock denial. My 6'7"", youthful, strong, loud, passionate, opinionated brother could not possibly be dead. He wasn't even 60 years old! Way to young to be *dead*. But there was no denying the body in that casket. He weighed 114 pounds when he died. He didn't look at all like the vital man I remember, but it was him, and he was gone. Forever. Wow, this has gotten long. If you're still with me, thank you so much. Unfortunately, there's more. Will you bear with me, please? I am just in a dither over Jarrod's death. The minute I heard he'd died, I went into digestive distress. Everything gross that can happen to your digestive system, it's been happening to me. I can't eat. My head aches all the time. I ache all over, and I can't sleep. I have so much stuff to do in the garden and in the house (The dishes look like either Everest or Nepal) but I can't force myself to do anything. I'm such a mess. I'm mystified, really. I don't understand why it's hitting me this hard. Well I do but, I mean, I didn't know him, really, and lots of my family and friends have died in various ways over my 50+ years. Death has never really bothered me this much before. Buuut ... Jerrod is the first close family member to die since I embraced my doubt and became a (pretty flaming) atheist. Jerrod is gone *forever*, and I'm suffering not a little consternation at the fact that I don't have the comfort, however ignorant, of the old stand-by, ""He's in a better place."" He's not. His essence, his being, his personality, his talent, his music, his work, his play, his joy, his sorrow, everything but my memories of him, and that well-pickled husk in the ground, (There's a whole different topic- our weird western death customs. Don't get me started!) have ceased to exist. I think the thing that has me panicking the worst, and I feel guilty that it isn't straight-forward grief at losing my brother, is that Jarrod was right next to me in age. It wasn't his *turn* to go yet, you know? We almost lost my oldest brother. He went through hell with his cancer, but he came out the other side. He's scarred for the rest of his life, but he seems content. He still works full time, and enjoys his family, his football, and his dogs. My oldest brother's death would definitely have been sad, but it wouldn't have surprised me. Another of my brothers has heart disease. He's always been a hard-driving bull of a man. We all know he's been living on borrowed time for most of his life. His death will be sad. (he hides a heart of gold under that crusty exterior) but not a surprise. Jerrod being the first of us to go felt like an existential earthquake. All of us are so shaken, and I can't shake the feeling that *I'm next*. Since Jerrod's passing I've had the most unsettling feeling that someone, some thing, is coming to *get* me. It's a feeling of deep dread, constant simmering panic, and physical illness. I know, on some level that my physical symptoms are just grief and anguish, but niggling at me, in the back of my mind, is a little voice: *""Maybe you have cancer too. You're probably going to get cancer just like all the rest of your family. Granddad had it. Aunt Elsie and Aunt Edna had it. Dad had it. Big Brother had it. You're going to get it too. It's just a matter of time. Maybe you already have it, maybe that's why you feel so sick. Maybe you have it already. ^Maybe ^you ^have ^it ^already. ^Maybe ^you ^have ^it ^already... ""* I need to see a shrink, probably. But I've had the worst luck with them, lately. It's pretty bad when you realize, halfway through your third or fourth session, that your shrink is crazier than you are! And I need to see my family doctor and ask him to order every possible cancer test for me. If he'll do them, maybe the ominous voices in my head will STFU and I can get on with my life, and find a way to honor Jerrod's memory instead of anticipating my own end. Holy shit, what a wall-o-text. Thanks so much for staying with me. Ok, hitting submit at last. Here goes!"	TrueOffMyChest
"Sudden loss of appetite in elderly dog: consistent with ""normal"" aging and/or typical untreatable causes of geriatric death?"	"## Case details Dog. 12 years old. Giant Schnauzer, certified, from Boston area. Male, neutered, resides in Southern Ontario (Canada). Tail docked, ears uncropped, smallish, 85-90 pounds. Active &amp; healthy youth, knee problems with replacement surgery about 6 years ago, replacement surgery on second knee about 6 months ago. No known internal medical problems beyond slow accumulation of lipomas. He is currently on anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis in the knees, as well as gabapentin for pain. In recent months, general lethargy, increasing, and accelerating rapidly in the past month. It is reported to me that he fatigues rapidly when exercised, and that some muscle wastage in his haunches is occurring. He has also recently shown a serious (although not complete) loss of appetite for both regular meals and treats. ## Request for advice I've been away from town for several months, and my [parent's] elderly dog is getting older. I realize that. However, I am disturbed by the reports of the recent rapid decline, especially by his reported loss of appetite. This is a dog who has always been intensely, annoyingly food driven. There has never before been a more important moment in his universe than meal time. I am not in a position to directly do anything about his treatment, but my parents do offer consideration of my advice. I would like some guidance regarding whether the loss of appetite is a normal, general ""end of life"" symptom for aging dogs, and what diagnostic measures you might take or questions you might have in this situation. He receives treatment from a vet that my parents have a great deal of confidence in. Her approach to this situation (paraphrased from a paraphrase) is that there is no possible cause for his symptoms that can be treated effectively, and that therefore it makes no sense to attempt to diagnose any problems. This includes all first-line diagnostic measures like bloodwork, et cetera. We're not talking about trips to specialists. On their behalf, I will say that my parents have already been down that road all the way to the grim, unlucky, undiagnosed ending with another dying (albeit much younger) Giant Schnauzer. I was there, and I wouldn't wish it on another dog. The thing that I am struggling with about his vet's approach is that the lack of a positive diagnosis opens a can of 'maybe' worms for me; it doesn't allow for the possibility that she may be in error about something. I have as little contextual information as I am giving you in this post, with the additional handicap of not being a veterinarian. For all I know, his current veterinarian has checked every other possibility very carefully, and this has simply not been communicated to me. I am trying to avoid asking you to second-guess her approach to treatment, death, or dying. I know that dogs are not natural creatures. I know that they suffer from a genetic error that causes them to have very high mutation rates, and that they are deliberately bred to specifications that have nothing to do with their fitness to survive, and that consequently they frequently encounter untreatable disorders and diseases, some of which can be quite vague and mysterious. I know that willing my dog to continue to live will not suffice in this situation. However, I would like your bare perspective on what might be going on, and anything specific you might do to rule out non-geriatric possibilities; additionally, if there was anything that might alter or determine the course of palliative treatment in a situation like this."

just graduated, degree is useless, no aptitude for anything practical, introverted, can't drive--career advice appreciated	Hi. I just graduated with my BS in History (3.7 GPA). It's a notoriously bad degree for finding work with. I live in a rural area and am moving to an even smaller one. &amp;nbsp; I can't drive (though I'm working on it), and I'm very introverted. I get extremely exhausted from interacting with people all day. I've worked as a cashier, where I had to talk to customers non-stop, and by the end of the day I'd be almost incomprehensible--I tend to start making speech mistakes when I've been talking to people too much. So a job where I don't have to interact too much with people would be preferred. I'd be extremely mentally exhausted when I got home, to the point where I was good for nothing but sleeping. &amp;nbsp; I don't turn my nose up at manual labor, but the register setup where I worked was very ergonomically unsound. After I pulled a 16-hour shift, my shoulder has never stopped hurting when I use that arm. That started 3 years ago. I don't think it's going away anytime soon (I don't have insurance). So I don't think I can do full-time manual labor, or even something like Walmart, where on part time you're pushed pretty hard physically. &amp;nbsp; I'm terrible at math and numbers. I even switch up simple numbers for mathematical operations I know. (Ex: 3 x 15, I'll think something like, ahh, yes, 3 x 10, that's 30--* writes down 30 *.) I have trouble keeping my left and right straight too, and have had trouble reading analog clocks for a long time. So I think I probably have an undiagnosed math learning disorder. So I don't think anything math or sciencey or numbery is in the cards for me. My spatial skills are pretty poor too. &amp;nbsp; I'm also squeamish about diseases and the human body. I can't go the teaching route either--that was my original plan. Something in my juvenile history is being flagged as an adult charge, and they won't certify me to teach as a result. I might be able to get it fixed, but I don't want to count on it. &amp;nbsp; For positives, I'm good at writing, and I like to dabble in art and graphic design (nothing good enough to go pro). I can sew (not very well, my sewing machine broke so I haven't done it in a long time) and I can use Microsoft Office, Excel, etc. The thing I like to do most is read and learn new things. I like nature too. &amp;nbsp; I really just want something where I can support myself decently, have insurance, and not end the day in physical pain or mental/emotional exhaustion. Any advice is appreciated!	findapath
So much good!	This pregnancy has been hard on me. Both physically and mentally. And many MANY things are going...crazy. I feel really overwhelmed and out of control. However, I am lucky enough to have so many wonderful things to focus on. My SO is just incredible 99.9% of the time (he took forever to get ready yesterday morning and I wanted to kill him, that's the extent of the .1%). I went from doing most of the cleaning (my own choice) and all of the cooking to just being in charge of cooking. He does anything I ask him to do, even if he doesn't agree with me. My mom is coming to stay with us for a few months to help with the baby and I cannot wait! I wish she was here already. She lives in another country and I miss her terribly. She is going to be such a huge help when the baby comes. I'm really familiar with babies, but my SO has never been around an infant. Having another person with 30+ years of experience will be a gift when I'm drained. My MIL is crazy, but so sweet. She has her issues (my mom too) but her compassion and loving nature overrides it. She is couponer and often sends awesome products home with us whenever we visit. Just the other day she got a steal on diapers and wipes. She never pushes our boundaries. Loves the name we picked. Is always super sweet to me. I love her. I really lucked out. Our friends are incredible people. Whatever we need, they're up for it. Two of my closest friends demanded that I let them do the shower. One of them gave me her very expensive swing (she has a one year old) and plans on lending me any big toys I might want. My SO's good friend gave us his 3-way crib and his infant carseat/stroller (has not expired, never in an accident). They totally support anything we decide and are thrilled about the baby. My health hasn't been great for over a decade due to an auto-immune disease going undiagnosed until a few years ago. But I just had another ultrasound and the baby is perfect. 58th percentile and everything looks great. Whatever else happens, I am so lucky to have the fantastic people and support in my life. I love them all.	BabyBumps
I wonder how many people have diseases whose symptoms are treatable by marijuana who go undiagnosed because they're always high.		Showerthoughts
Question to the amazing people of this sub / Help I'm scared and want to be told I'm being dramatic.	"# About this Post This will be a bit of long post, but I will try to organize and format it for easy reading, and thank you in advance for your time and help. **Also before we get into it, I know the sub is not / can not going to give medical advice and cannot tell me 100% certainty about my situation, but I am going to be doing the same medical thing regardless, I just want personal thoughts.** I'm looking to get some input from the wonderful people in this sub to find out if my story sounds like something to worry about (similar to a worst case scenario) or is definitely just a scare...as I figure this sub has heard it all at this point. I'm guessing I am probably closer to a scare case and in the event of that I welcome you all to tell me to calm my ass down a bit :). I need some perspective from those who are in the midst of this and have been past the point I am at...which is just freaking the fuck out. ***** # The Story / Details **TLDR: I was told on Saturday/Sunday at the ER that there are several masses in my lungs, as found by a CT scan.** **Full Story:** On Saturday night/early Sunday morning I was admitted to the ER with abnormal chest and back pain, around the right side ribs front and back. At first we thought it was nothing serious, as it was probably a 1 or 2 on the pain level, but after a few hours it was up to a 10 out of 10 or even 11 in some cases, I had a mild fever, cold sweats, feelings of being extremely cold, tingling hands (both, left, or right, never feet), etc. My gf and I were scared to say the least. After running ~5 hours in the ER/Hospital, a full works of tests and CT scans, and (thankfully) a pain med cocktail to help me get some rest/relax a bit, the Doctor said he believed the pains were caused by an undiagnosed bit of pneumonia or an infection of some bronchial nature and gave me some antibiotics to help...since then the pain has not returned. However during the results, the CT scan found two ""sizable"" dark masses in my lungs, and I silently/internally began to half freak out, half not (more on this in a bit). I was given the info to follow up with and am arranging that now that the holiday is over. Details on myself: * 26 years old, Male * Don't Smoke, rarely drink, no longer do drugs of any kind (but I mean we all were teens once haha) * Was around 320 lbs at my heaviest, have dropped to ~240 in the last 10 or so months, goal is ~220 for my height/build. * See a Dr. regularly, especially after family heart problems were made known when Dad had Quad Bypass...that started the weight loss and such. * Have had full range of blood tests, checkups, etc ran on me for general health, heart health, joint and organ health etc in the last 10 or so months just to get a snapshot of where I am and all came back 100% healthy and positive. * No family genetic disposition to cancer in people under 55. The only other detail I want to mention is I was born and raised in Memphis TN, which has a common(ish) occurence of [Histoplasmosis](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/histoplasmosis/basics/definition/con-20026585). My mother also had a similar situation where they found ""masses"" in her lungs that was in fact Histo masses / errors in the CT scan...but those were white, not dark. # The Question Knowing the story, and what I know, what is your opinion on my case. Regardless I am going to follow up on things and am going to set up that appointment at lunch today, but: * Am I over-reacting? AKA: Does this sound like the kind of situation that is just a scare/I'm probably right about the histo, The masses are definately/wayyy more than likely not to be cancer, From people / stories of lung cancer / lymphoma this is no where near what happens, etc...if so...feel free to verbally slap me and tell me to, ""GET MY SHIT TOGETHER DAVE, FUCK!"" * or * Should I worry? Does this sound like a similar / usual case for lymphoma/cancer? Is histo 100% out b/c of the color, etc?"	cancer
Moving D-:	My wife and I are both chronic pain sufferers; she's got a herniated disk and degenerative disk disease and I have an as of yet undiagnosed pelvic pain that we've discovered is NOT my uterus. Anyway. We're moving right now. From an upstairs apartment. Seriously, guys, this is so hard. Even with help, we're both dead women walking (or rather, hobbling) by the end of the day. We have 4 more days to be out of here, and it's so terrible. The worst part is that we're just moving to a temporary situation (I had to stop working, as I had a very physical job and could no longer do it, and my wife can only do work from home transcribing) so now we're poorer than church mice, and will be staying on my dad's former tour bus (he's a musician no longer playing really due to the economic slump) until we can apply for and get section 8/low income housing. Sorry that was rambley. But shit dude, all this lifting and stair climbing and packing is kicking our asses. On the bright side, my body is getting used to my depo shot, and I've stopped constantly bleeding for the first time in a year! What's your guyses week looking like? The good, the bad, and the ugly!

New Australian studies identify likely physiological cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome	"Hi everyone In a paper published today, and another published a couple of weeks ago, in the journal of Immunology and Immunogenetics Insights, Australian researchers have found what they believe could be the physiological cause of ME/CFS. The research is being presented at the Invest in ME biomedical conference in London this Friday. (as an aside: I’m sorry about the amount of text to follow…) I know about the research because my dad (Professor Don Staines) is one of the lead researchers on the study, at the National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases at Griffith University, Australia. Whilst I’m Australian, I have lived in the UK for ten years. In no other advanced western country, as far as I’m aware, has the debate over whether ME/CFS is a physiological or psychological condition been more intense. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) refuses to align itself with the World Health Organisation’s classification of ME/CFS as a neurological, and therefore physiological, illness. Instead, it still considers it as a mental health condition that is treatable with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and Graded Exercise Therapy. (No doubt, people here understand this conflict and have experienced the discrepancy between their own, very physical experiences and the attitudes of the medical establishment.) The significance of this research is therefore mammoth and challenges the dominant psychology-based paradigm in the UK. (If you’ve not seen it already, there’s a very insightful (and harrowing) video about the extent to which the medical establishment in the UK are willing to go to enforce this psychiatric paradigm. It was produced by a mother and brother of an ME/CFS patient in the UK – it’s called Voices from the Shadows and you can find it on Vimeo. I think they’re offering a free download at the moment.) At the time of writing this I have contacted one newspaper here in the UK to give them a heads up on the new research published today, but they’ve not responded yet. (The Griffith University research team has already spoken to the Australian press about their first paper, but other than articles on the News Medical and Fibromyalgia News Today sites, I can’t see any traction as yet – but the second paper has only just been uploaded by the journal). To help the research get attention over here in the UK, I’ve written an article summarising the findings and submitted it to the British newspaper I just mentioned. (I’m not a journalist, but a freelance copywriter by trade.) I have a feeling it won’t get published because a) it was unsolicited and b) there’s a conflict of interest, because I’ve written about/supplied quotes from my dad. (Indeed, I might get a few raised eyebrows here because of this conflict of interest). Because the newspaper hasn’t responded, I’m now going to post it here – in the hope that it will reach people who would like to know about these developments in ME/CFS research. I’m sure the major news agencies will eventually report on the research findings. And although the findings will obviously need to be corroborated by other research labs, things are looking promising. The scientific explanations in my article have been vetted, but I also urge you to look at the two peer-reviewed research papers which can be found online through the journal of Immunology and Immunogenetics Insights and keep your eyes peeled for reports in the news. 1st paper: [Examination of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Ion Channels in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Patients](http://www.la-press.com/examination-of-single-nucleotide-polymorphisms-snps-in-transient-recep-article-a4824) (Published on 10 May 2015) 2nd paper, published today: [Examination of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Acetylcholine Receptors in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Patients](http://www.la-press.com/examination-of-single-nucleotide-polymorphisms-in-acetylcholine-recept-article-a4862) (Published 26th May 2015) My article: **New Australian studies identify likely physiological cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome** Georgina Treloar Researchers from Griffith University, Australia have discovered what may be the underlying cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), and have potentially identified a new type of illness that transcends current disease classification and challenges dominant thinking about the debilitating condition. In two studies published in the Journal of Immunology and Immunogenetics Insights the research team provides evidence that strongly links ME/CFS to genetic anomalies associated with human cell receptors, namely, transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels and acetylcholine receptors (AChR). TRP ion channels are also known as ‘threat receptors’ and are ancient signalling mechanisms that exist in almost every cell of our body. AChR are part of the ancient immune system but are also associated with neurological and muscle signalling. Professor Don Staines, of the Griffith University team, said: ""We essentially have two parts of the immune system. One is our learned or acquired immune system, which includes the creation of antibodies in response to pathogens we encounter in our environment. The other is our ancient, or innate, immune system which has no such memory. TRPs and AChRs are part of the latter."" The innate immune system, rather than producing antibodies, relies on natural killer cells, macrophages, mast cells and even gaseous transmitters such as nitric oxide and carbon monoxide to attack any incoming threat. Poor control of this ancient system or its protracted toxic effects is likely to be debilitating. The Griffith researchers found what is likely causing altered control of this system in ME/CFS patients. They have identified changes in the genetic makeup of both TRP and AChR receptors in 115 ME/CFS patients compared to 90 healthy controls. These aberrations are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and involve changes in base nucleotides in important components of the genes. SNPs may result in changes to the structure and function of cell receptors. This, Professor Staines said, could be the key to a profound miscalculation of the immune system and cellular pathways. In other words, it could be sending the innate immune system into aberrant signalling and compromising healthy cell function in ME/CFS patients. Importantly, because these factors exist within the innate immune system, rather than the acquired one, the findings could explain why no one has been able to pinpoint a viral or bacterial cause of the condition to date. It also tees up with the experience of sufferers, who maintain that symptoms get worse after they've been exposed to various stimuli. ""Many types of stressors will exacerbate this condition, potentially explaining why patients do worse when exposed to a variety of infections, chemicals, foods, drugs and imposed physical exercise. Changes in threat receptors and acetylcholine receptors will likely lead to significantly altered (patho)physiology"" said Professor Staines. It could also explain why sufferers report the onset of symptoms after events such as a viral infection, an operation or an accident. The study strongly suggests that ME/CFS is, in fact, an altered immune response to such events. However, it's likely the response of the ancient part of our immune system that has hitherto not been adequately explored. The findings challenge the dominant position in the UK that ME/CFS has a psychological cause and that treatments such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) are in any way effective. Many in the medical and scientific community have long held that the name Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, coined in the US in 1987, describes only one of the symptoms experienced by patients and that it unhelpfully stigmatises the condition. Sufferers and their families usually prefer the alternative, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) as it carries less of a stigma and implies a physiological cause. The term ME, however, is also a misnomer, as it does little to explain the underlying pathology of the illness, which until now has remained obscure. The condition entails profound fatigue, usually worsened by exertion, and an incapacitating type of brain fog associated with greatly impaired memory, concentration and rational and emotional thought processes. Many other debilitating symptoms occur. Most who experience it describe it as the worst experience of their lives and as if it is the experience of death. Many are undiagnosed or disbelieved; a number suicide. Currently no confirmatory diagnostic test is available, and diagnosis depends on meeting case definitions that have evolved over time. In most major western countries, the International Consensus Case Definition is used and follows from the Canadian Case Definition. However, in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has not aligned itself with these case definitions. Nor does NICE wholly adopt the World Health Organisation's guidelines which classify ME/CFS as a neurological, and thus physiological, disorder. Instead, it still treats the condition as a mental disorder. The NHS, under guidance from NICE, suggests patients are treated with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), Graded Exercise Therapy (GET), Activity Management, Medication and Pacing. The General Medical Council (GMC) supports these treatments. A number of prominent psychologists even claim that the syndrome is perpetuated by a patient's fear of exercise and that it is a form of 'avoidance phobia'. The Griffith University study shows that the reason physical activity worsens symptoms is quite possibly because exercise demands AChR and TRP function in significantly impaired receptors. In other words, cell function markedly deteriorates with exercise. Patients, rather than being uncooperative, are fearful of exercise because it gravely worsens symptoms, because something major is happening to them at a cellular level. ""Imposed physical exercise is likely to be counter-productive in our model of illness causation. We believe that imposed so-called exercise therapies and so-called cognitive behavioural therapies are misguided as they do not fit within a rational scientific model of causation of this illness."" says Professor Staines. The debate between the physiological and psychological camps of ME/CFS has raged for years in the UK, more so than in any other advanced western country. The desperate lack of scientific evidence has meant diagnosis is problematic and treatments ineffective – leaving doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals with no clear understanding of how to deal with what is an ostensibly chimerical condition. In such an environment, it's always been the patients and their families who have suffered the most. A legal challenge to have the NICE classification of ME/CFS changed to reflect a neurological, and thus physiological, cause was unsuccessful when it went to judicial review in 2009. Reclassification has since been relegated down the priority list by NICE. However, the organisation does claim it would welcome being informed of the publication of any additional new evidence when it arises. Despite the general consensus amongst policy makers to keep it as a psychological condition, just prior to this, in 2006, strong campaigning by patients, charities, politicians and doctors via the Gibson Inquiry resulted in the Medical Research Council (MRC) producing £1.6m of ring-fenced funding for research into finding a cause. This included biomedical research into possible physiological causes in the areas of neuropathology and immune dysregulation. Whilst these areas are indeed germane to the condition, they don't directly hold the key to the cause. Research in these areas has therefore failed to produce pathological proof. Based on the Griffith University team's finding, Professor Staines, when asked what sort of classification ME/CFS should now fall under, says: ""Because these receptors are expressed absolutely everywhere it is an illness that affects all body systems, so it could be seen as immunological, neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and skeletomuscular…Our sense is this is likely to be an ion channel disease, but also an ACh receptor disease…therefore probably both…making it a unique problem for disease classification. Indeed some of these two receptor types are both anatomically and functionally linked. Our research suggests that CFS/ME is in fact an illness within a novel category of disease pathomechanism. The critical next step is to try to determine if these SNP anomalies actually do cause change in function of these receptors"". He also highlighted that the WHO should be the final arbiters when it comes to disease classification and indicated that governmental health bodies in the UK may be perceived to have difficulty with re-considering this illness as physiological. The National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases at Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia, is dedicated to research on the interaction between the nervous system and the immune system and is led by Professors Sonya Marshall-Gradisnik and Donald Staines. “These findings have been achieved through a team effort involving researchers, patients, funding bodies and clinicians” say the Professors, who are presenting a report on their two studies this Friday at the Invest in ME biomedical conference in London. The two research articles are available online through the journal of Immunology and Immunogenetics Insights."	cfs

My panic attacks are evil. I get no fear or actual panic, but rather become violently ill. I'm panicking right now and it's just torture. [Rant]	Gotta love it when your panic disorder is so bad you have a full, vomit-inducing panic attack just from getting a tiny bit nauseous from having the audacity to indulge a little. I only tend to eat one meal a day, and I keep myself to a simple, strict diet: eat until you’re no longer hungry. No fullness allowed. Because the feeling of fullness makes me sick, and when I get sick, I panic and wind up vomiting and blowing diarrhea out my ass at the same time. And since I have a phobia of being sick that way, the panic only feeds into itself until I’m so exhausted I pass out on my bathroom floor after I’m completely empty of all the bile my gall bladder can squirt out of me. I’m waiting for my xanax and zofran (for the vomiting) to kick in, hiding in my bathroom right now. For the love of god, all I had was root beer. But the sugar and caffeine set off the neurological disorder, because my panic attacks are correlated to my epilepsy. So not only do I become violently ill, but I also shake just as violently. I can scarcely think myself out of them, also. I know it’s a panic attack, and my mind feels perfectly sound, but my psyche is unconsciously causing hysteria to the point that I think I’m sick even though I’m not. Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy. Any change in routine my body interprets as a disease. Eating the wrong thing, going out more than 1-2 times a month, eating at a restaurant - even doing something as benign as answering the phone induces a panic attack. I can’t even sit in a car without the air conditioner blowing directly at me because something as simple as getting too warm sparks an attack of nausea and shaking. Anything that makes me feel, or even risks making me feel nauseous is enough to trigger it like I’ve swallowed ipecac. My body just expels everything in it as fast as it can, presumably because my subconscious is positive that I’m somehow poisoned. I blame my celiac disease for that; growing up undiagnosed and ill all the time. I want to cry, but I know that any amount of stomach contractions would be enough to make me panic more. So all I can do is sit numbly in the bathroom, hiding and waiting for it all to stop. I just want to rest.	Anxiety

its been 8 years,and after seeing doctor's all over the country, thousands of dollars worth of supplements and every test run known to man, I still HAVE NO DIAGNOSIS for my autoimmune disease and no treatment what so ever..WTF	I am at my wits end here, I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue as well as chronic flare ups of the Epstein barr virus, back in 2007 shortly after I gave birth to my son and have been to specialists all over the country as well as testing positive for ANA finally last year when i was forced to drop out of school due to my illness with only one month before i would be graduating. I have been run through the barrage of tests since November of last year, and I am still untreated as well as undiagnosed.. I am so frustrated and tired of feeling awful, yet having no ideas or treatment options since I am, and have been for 8 years now, a complete medical mystery. I am 28, in great shape (or so I appear) and am bed ridden with new, bizarre and disturbing symptoms occurring almost daily...I feel like my doctor who ive been working with since I first got diagnosed, has just given up or something because although he's run hundreds of tests on me and seen my physical symptoms, hair loss, skin changes, rashes, swollen lymph nodes, tremor in hands...he still gives me no ideas, no treatment other than bunk herbal supplements that have cost me hundreds of dollars, yet I haven't seen or felt any improvement AT ALL. what is going on? I need answers, I am in so much pain and although I have been working for only 3 months now, I am getting so much worse, so quickly, that I may lose this job soon, too.. ive been sick for 8 years!! yet with all the specialists, the tests, the physical symptoms and me getting worse quickly, I still have no doctor who can even point me in what they think MAY BE THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I am completely untreated, nothing for my pain, nothing for sleep, nothing for ANYTHING and I am so discouraged with todays Doctor's that I am seriously considering just giving up trying to get a diagnoses, cuz no one within the past 8 years has said anything other than, take this! or try this! NO DIAGNOSIS, NO RELIEF, yet I am supposed to keep my act together? im absolutely infuriated and I feel like a dog chasing its tail	AskDocs
Wanting to become an accountant but needing some academic advice...	Trying to keep it brief… I am a college senior in a science major. For several reasons I have decided accounting is a good career path. Now I’m trying to figure out how to go about this. I started college at a mediocre state school as a science major and did quite well (3.6 GPA). Junior year I transferred to a well known state school with a very good reputation. Around the time I transferred, I developed a quite serious disease, became depressed/had trouble focusing, and now my transcript is absolutely terrible from when I was living with this undiagnosed disease junior and senior year. Since GPA doesn’t transfer between schools, my GPA at this current school is a 2.66. :( I only need one more class this fall to finish my degree. In order to switch to accounting, I see two possible options: 1. Don’t graduate. Transfer back to first school and take their accounting program (would take me a year and a half, and my parent is faculty there so practically free tuition). My 3.6 GPA still stands, so this would allow me to graduate with a decent GPA. 2. Finish my degree because I am so absurdly close to being done anyway, retake a few classes in the fall to boost my GPA a little, then take some business/accounting classes after graduation and try to apply to a master’s program. Any advice/input as to the best way to go about this would be great.	Accounting

Use of intranasal GHRP( growth hormone releasing peptides). A log of usage and instructions for how to make your own	So I recently became interested in GHRPs for their use in promoting the healing of tissues and sleep enhancement.I am coming off of a spinal surgery 2 years ago that really didn't do what I hoped it would, and I also have been battling an auto immune disease which has caused me chronic insomnia for the past two years. I was mostly just researching them as I was not really interested in having to deal with needles or injections, that was until I came across an article that talked about the nasal delivery of the peptides and I decided that was something that I would be willing to do. I obtained 5mg of GHRP-6 and made a solution of 45 mg NaCl(preservative), and 5 ml of H2O. All this was added to a nasal sprayer that delivers .1 ml per spray, so a total of 100 ug GHRP-6 per spray. My reaction to the peptide has been immediate and overwhelmingly positive. The first thing I noticed was an increase in my desire to eat, as in an overwhelming desire to eat every possible thing in sight, which to me is a pretty good side effect because I have struggled to maintain adequate weight due to a restricted diet for my auto immune condition. I suppose I will take this moment to promote what for me has been the single greatest medical treatment I have had in the past 3 years of being sick with an undiagnosed auto immune condition and after seeing literally 15 specialist. That medical treatment is Helminth therapy or the use of hookworms to help control whatever the hell is wrong with my body. I am 4 months into the treatment having taken close to 50 of the hookworms and my debilitating eye, prostate, and joint, as well as extreme food intolerances have subsided by 95%, to which I attribute solely to probiotics and the hookworms. Anyway after only 4 days of taking this nasal GHRP I feel like my body is taking a cool drink of water after being in the desert for years. Before getting sick I was always a fan of naps and I never had a problem with sleeping well during the night, but after 1.5 years of being sick I lost the ability to sleep and have only been able to get what I would describe as non restorative and interrupted sleep. Yesterday I took a most glorious nap, and that later in the night slept straight through the night, having a multitude of dreams. Anyway 4 days of treatment is hardly conclusive to say what the long term use of this treatment will be, and I am not even sure what my long term aim is at this point. I am 27 years old and a male, and I mostly just wanted to post this to show that there is an alternative to pinning GHRPs and they nasal delivery does indeed work. I hope some of you have found this interesting and I will try to answer any questions you may have.	Nootropics

Yesterday I took a most glorious nap, and that later in the night slept straight through the night, having a multitude of dreams. I realize 4 days of treatment is hardly conclusive to say what the long term use of this treatment will be, and I am not even sure what my long term aim is at this point. I am 27 years old and a male, and I mostly just wanted to post this to show that there is an alternative to pinning GHRPs and they nasal delivery does indeed work. I hope some of you have found this interesting and I will try to answer any questions you may have.	steroids

Is feeling a lot better on antibiotics normal?	I was bitten by a tick about a week ago and went to the doc and got antibiotics and the rash pretty much gone now. The day after taking the first dose of the treatment I felt a little bit sick. My throat was sore and I was achy. The next day, so 3 pills into the treatment, I woke up after the best sleep that I can remember and I feel wonderful. It is strange I can’t clearly remember feeling this good before. I also have been diagnosed with ADD after struggling in school even though no one ever took notice really because I could all ways get decent grades and I am not hyper at all. For me I have always had a focus issues since I was a child but they didn’t diagnose me until I was 17 on my way to college because I demanded they test me for learning disabilities as a condition for me going. So having focus problems is normal for me. What I think isn’t normal is this mental fatigue I get throughout the day which makes focusing almost impossible. I think it started sometime around middle school and I just accepted it as a fact of life. I played a lot outside growing up and attended many camps in new jersey. I have pulled ticks off of myself but never noticed a rash. I have never really been sick to the point of worry. But now after taking the antibiotics it seems like my mental fatigue is gone and the fog in my head is gone and I seem to have way more physical and mental energy. My thoughts seem a lot clearer. This is really strange feeling. The closest thing I have experienced to this was taking Ritalin but I stopped taking it because it was exhausting and the side effects made me feel like I was dying. This feeling is like Ritalin but without the side effects. Is this a normal antibiotic high? Or could it be that I have previously undiagnosed lyme disease? Is this something that other people experienced and was it enough to explore further? Ignorance was bliss but now I know I can feel a lot better. Don’t want to go back down.	Lyme
doctors aren't doing enough for my GF	I really need help with medical problems my gf is experiencing. Usually I would never turn to the public for medical advice, but I feel like the doctors are underestimating the severity of her symptoms. If I am not following any rules or am in the wrong section, please let me know. Thank you in advice. Symptoms: -Recovering Bulemia (had for almost ten years, started seeing a therapist who specializes in it about 6 months ago, has helped greatly but she does relapse.) -Anxiety/ Depression -Rashes on arms/ armpits/ other places? -Severe nausea and constant vomiting when she eats/ drinks -very lethargic and has been sleeping a lot during the day, but then gets insomnia sometimes at night? -body aches/ joint pain/ back hurts bad -abdominal pain, stomach hurts -sore throat/ stiff neck -diarrhea/ constipation -dizziness/ double vision -gets very hot, her tongue gets hot? but then sometimes she gets chills or sweats -numbness in arms, tongue, other places? -she has three small black dots that have appeared, one near elbow, one on her finger, one somewhere on leg I think? About the size of a pencil tip, all black, not raised or anything, like an all black freckle -she's urinated herself twice over the last few days -feeling of fullness in throat/stomach? -heavy and irregular menstrual cycle over past few months -forgetfulness/ confusion -dry hands and I can see bad dandruff I've never noticed -redness around gums -urine has been cloudy -dark line on the edge of her middle finger nail, looks like her nail is going black on the left side -worsened anxiety/ panic attacks Current Issue: I really only know what my GF is telling me, I mostly trust that she isn't lying to me, but might be lying to herself due to mental health issues or isn't thinking clearly? She is very sick, she can't eat/drink water/take tums without throwing up. When she gets malnourished she starts acting irrationally and can't think clearly. A few days ago she was so sick I took her to urgent care where they diagnosed her with anemia and told her she needed blood work done immediately to find out what type of anemia and because she has other symptoms as well, they told her specifically they were going to test for hypothyroidism and lymphomia. This is where it gets a little confusing. They told her to see her Primary Caregiver because he has access to her complete medical history, but her PC can't see her for two more weeks... her mom called (the hospital? her doctors office?) and now shes getting a blood test tomorrow, but they can only test for the anemia? huh? Her situation is very serious because it is complicated by mental health issues which is what I think they aren't realizing. I'm very worried that if they don't treat her for dehydration/malnourishment/diseases in the meantime she isn't going to last two weeks. I'm afraid shes going to try driving while shes dizzy/light-headed and crash, get very malnourished and possibly harm herself, or an undiagnosed disease will cause severe damage in the meantime. Other Background: her mom is anemic (not sure what type) and has hosmimoto thyroidism disease and hypothyroidism I can provide any other information that I might not have realized or can ask her, I just don't want to see her like this, she was having a panic attack yesterday and started randomly smiling and laughing, when I asked what was funny and told her she was scaring me, she told me she's tired of being sick and that she'll be okay soon. The only time I've seen her act like that was the worst fight we had before she was being treated for bulemia, she was being very irrational then too because she hadn't eaten anything/ drank water/ slept in close to three days. Today is going to be the third day she hasn't eaten/drank much water without throwing up. I am very very concerned and she won't let me call her doctor because she says I'm not authorized. I don't know the process so it's hard for me to argue. She saw her psychologist yesterday and if it's this serious I don't understand why she wouldn't do more to help? She pretty much just told her she needed to get bloodwork done immediately. If anybody has any questions please don't hesitate to ask and I will tell you what I know or ask her. I just don't know what to do anymore.	bulimia
What do my test results mean?	Hello . . . I'm new to this subreddit, so I hope I do everything right. As a quick side note, I've had an undiagnosed disease for 10 years, and I've had symptoms since middle school. I am now 32. I know that I can't just ask for a diagnosis, so I thought I would see if maybe someone could help me understand my [test results](http://imgur.com/EqSMIXT). I also know that Lyme tests aren't exactly known for being accurate. Anyway, I've removed the personal info. Click to zoom in. My doctor's office isn't open right now, and I'm too impatient to wait. It's 3 AM here, and this will keep me awake. Thank you.	Lyme
Suddenly being sued over medical bill, need help keeping the government from using asset seizure to pay this bill.	October 3rd, 2015. As I sat in my car to go to work I heard a loud pop in my back. I was suddenly overwhelmed with pain, it was immediately apparent something was wrong. I managed to drive to work anyway, and as I walked into my store it was so evident that I was unfit for work that my manager met me before I could clock on and asked me to pen a letter of resignation. Lucky for me I thought better of it and filed for short term disability and a F.M.L.A.. That saved my family for those sixth months. It has been gone for a few months now and we are desperately trying to scrape by with our petty 16$ a month from Oregon for food benefits. It has been incredibly difficult for us to get by. I have had to find out that filing disability claims is an extremely long and difficult process. I have been trying to get a diagnosis for what ails me. I was given an MRI that detected a tear in a disc in my lower back. I have been seeking treatment for that, including painful steriod injections, medications and an extremely painful discogram. I am now looking at a potential spinal fusion surgery. During my diagnosis for my back injury I have also found that I have another as of yet undiagnosed issue which contributes to my daily pain level of 8 out of 10. I'm now seeing a neurologist, who has given me another MRI and thankfully cleared me of a brain tumor. Unfortunately my next test is for huntingtons disease. The state of Oregon has a 15 month long back log of cases. To add to that it took 6 monthsto get through the process of asking for a hearing. I likely have at least another year until my hearing and perhaps even more time until my benefits begin. I am unfortunately at this point devoid of other options and I need to ask for help. I was served papers for small claims court because one of the clinics that I recieved an MRI at neglected to bill my insurance properly. On top of starving and having to give up on my independence, these people aim to garnish wages from my wife, or seize our assets because of their mistake. I wasn't contacted by them either by mail or phone, just a court summons several months afterwards over a bill that should have been sent to my insurance. To add to how distressing this is when I have no income or savings left, it costs money just to submit a decision about how I am going to handle it. If I want to fight it in court I have to pay a court fee and travel to a city that I no longer live in. I am hoping that this plea for help reaches the right people. You will be doing more than helping me pay off a medical bill. You will be saving my family. I have almost 20k in debt worth of medical bills already and I haven't even had my surgery yet. Eventually disability will be able to help pay for these expenses. We desperately need this extra bit of help to get us through until then. My wife is doing her best to keep us afloat on a single income as a receptionist, but I'm sure you can imagine that it really isn't enough. We need your help. If this goes to court and we are forced to surrender her wages we will not survive. Before my accident I was a minimum wage worker and we struggled to get from one pay check to the next. My meager savings have been exhausted. We do not have family nearby that can help us. Our future will be bleak if we can not find help. I've set up a gofundme at gofund.me/M-R-I-Fiasco Edit: the gofundme campaing was bugged and had linked to a previous project. I copy pasta'd a new campaign with a 100$ reduction to the goal to reflect the donation made to the broken campaign. Thanks again everyone for the messages that have been sent.	Assistance

Jogging For Joshua - Running 1,000 miles for my son	Hi Reddit Community! My name is Brittney Gates. I am a 27 year old US Army veteran, competitive runner, kickboxer, violinist, and single mother of three beautiful children. My middle child – and only son – 7 year old Joshua, was born with a genetic disorder. He has a syndrome with no name; one of the rarest of syndromes. Doctors simply call it partial 4th chromosome deletion. He is a very special ‘special needs’ child. Before I tell you more about Joshua’s condition, I would like to explain to you my mission. I am looking to raise awareness, and funding, towards his incredibly rare syndrome. I plan to do this by running – A LOT. I’ve titled this adventure “Jogging for Joshua”. The journey has already begun with a Gofundme page, but my physical journey will begin Monday, June 29th, 2015, when I walk out my front door in Flushing, Queens, headed on a 220 mile run to Ocean City, MD. I am a one-person team, hoping that doing something I love can help out someone I love, by providing him with the medical attention, treatments, medications, therapies, and in-home support that I cannot provide for him on my own. Unfortunately, I do not qualify for government aid, which makes all of his health problems very financially hard on me. As of right now, I have a 1,000 mile goal set! However, the more money that is raised, the more miles I will run! The funds I am hoping to raise will go to a number of things, to include Joshua’s past and current medical bills, prescriptions, future bills and copays, as well as a donation to the amazing hospital that has been working with him – Cohen Children’s Medical Center- part of LIJ-in Long Island. I plan to document every step of this journey with social media updates, videos, photos, and the ability to follow me and see my progress on Map My Run. (you can view my public posts at www.facebook.com/brittney.gates123 ) Let me now tell you about Joshua, and why this mission is so important to me. Joshua is incredibly rare. Joshua has a genetic disorder that has only occurred 35 other times in medically history. (These numbers came from his first geneticist, Dr. Keri Casis, at Trinity Mother Francis Hospital in Tyler, TX in 2008, when Joshua was first diagnosed.) From what these doctors know and understand, it seems that Joshua is currently the only living person with this exact syndrome. As I stated once earlier, there is no name for it. Joshua is missing a chunk of the upper quadrant of his 4th chromosome. He lacks many, many genes that you and I and every other human being have. These genes are related to the heart, liver, kidneys, brain…and other vital organs. Because he does not have them, his body does not work properly. He is physically and cognitively underdeveloped. Joshua has ADHD and is on the autism spectrum. He has turrets, both verbal and physical ticks. He is 7 years old, and is not potty trained yet, still in pull-ups and having accidents often. So many things are out of his control, and of course, it’s frustrating for him. Joshua has very intense bouts of aggression, becoming physically violent and making threats at me and his two sisters. He is also quite anxious and has insomnia, so must take melatonin to trigger tiredness at night. Joshua has a blood disorder, that doctors cannot confirm or deny is related to his missing partial chromosome. He also has a heart murmur that cardiologists say could cause him many problems once he hits puberty. He has a vitamin D deficiency as well. He recently started on a heart and blood pressure medication, as well as a vitamin D supplement. Joshua has an undescended right testicle, up near his stomach. This will require surgery in (hopefully) September of this year, to bring the right testicle down into its proper place, and to perform a biopsy to confirm that he is not at risk for stomach cancer or testicular cancer. Joshua requires physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and group and individual counseling. He has many specialists, as well – hematology, cardiology, genetics, infectious disease, urology, neurology, mental and behavioral health, and gastroenterology. What I would like is for people like yourself to share mine and Joshua’s story. Joshua is a young, sick boy, who relies 100% on his mother to provide for him, and do everything in her power to make sure he is cared for. If running hundreds, thousands of miles, to gain supporters, is what it takes to make sure his life is more tolerable, I’ll gladly take on the challenge. I want to raise awareness for such rare disorders and illnesses. So many children go undiagnosed for ages, and spend their lives having great amounts of health problems, with no explanation as to WHY it’s happening. Thank you so much for listening to my story. Also, feel free to check out our Gofundme page at http://www.gofundme.com/af82zw Once again, thank you!	Charity
[28M] Medical circumstances which previously prevented a relationship now out of the way and not sure how or where to start again	I apologize for the novel, I really do, but I just don't know how else to explain this without the full context. I got some of the greatest news today, but it's also left me questioning where the hell I'm going to take my life from here. I don't even know where to start with this, because this is easily the 4th time my life has been upended over the last 10 years. I have a pretty crappy and EXTREMELY rare illness; up until recently, it's not uncommon for it to have been terminal in 5-10 years or 12-15 if you're lucky. There is a new form of treatment at a major research institution in the US that has reversed the terminal nature of the disease in other patients. I wasn't holding my breath, because my luck is crappy, so I was prepared to die sooner or later. I was well past denial and into full acceptance that I was a dead man walking. Well, all the imaging that has been taken over an extended period of time has shown great response to the treatment (wish I could say more - NDA is pretty strict). The illness isn't going away, it will still be chronic and degenerative in nature, but it doesn't appear that I'm going to be six feet under any time soon thanks to the hard work of some intelligent human beings. I even have seen some effects of the disease reversing, which is great. I attributed it to certain other medications I take but I found out that it was actually the treatment in action. This is a great win for me and my family. I walked out of the medical office today a new man, but also totally confused. I made plans based on the assumption that I was a dead man. It feels like a total mindfuck, but also a huge weight off my shoulders. It's not entirely over, as I'll still be taking medications to improve my ability to move around and such, but the most worrying portion is no longer an issue according to the team of doctors I have. In the short term, I'm still planning to get most of my travel bucket list out of the way, because if there's anything this experience has shown, it's that life is too short. My advice to everyone - enjoy it while you can, because it can be over in an instant. Anyways, moving on to the core of this issue. I lost the last ~5-7 years to this disease, from the early undiagnosed stages, to now, and I don't want the rest of my life to be similar. I would prefer to avoid being lonely, and these past years have been super lonely. When I told my friends what my fate at the time was, most of them seemed to head for the hills. I guess it creeped them out, not sure, but they all stopped contacting me and responding in short order. No big deal, they have their own lives, but it really takes a crisis like this to show who your true friends are, which in my case, is one person who has gone out of his way to keep in touch. I actually was planning to leave all of my finances to him, unbeknownst to him of course, because I made some wise business decisions early in adulthood and I wanted him to live a somewhat worry-free life in exchange for the kindness he showed me. So, I wasn't entirely alone - but it was and still is pretty bad. I feel like I've been in a form of solitary confinement, if that makes any sense. My highest priority right now, aside from gaining more strength, traveling, and hopefully getting back to work, is improving my physical appearance so that I can hopefully find my soulmate. It obviously slacked, I gained some weight, and my legs/arms/hands/face have edema from some heavy medications I was on - I'm now off some that caused it. I feel like I've been out of the loop for so long that I don't even know where I can go and meet new people. As you can expect, my hobbies are almost entirely based indoors because I've never really had the opportunity to experience the outdoors. I have a few questions, and please excuse my ignorance, but here goes: 1. Will most women turn me away because I appear physically weaker or have a chronic illness (not contagious or genetic)? Tremors and such; think Michael J. Fox, but not quite as intense. I'm 6'3, so it's not that I'm a small guy. I'm also a nerd and super shy, I was a math major in college and my career choice is unsurprisingly super nerdy, so I was never the social flower - but it seems other nerds make it work. 2. Does online dating work? I see commercials for eHarmony, but I've also heard horror stories. 3. Is it common for folks to be single at 28 these days? 4. I live in the party city of the US; Las Vegas. Going to the strip to meet people isn't all that great, considering most are visitors. I feel like online dating is the only solution in a place like this, but I could be wrong. I'm also considering moving elsewhere, where my search may be more successful. My education and choice of career pretty much allows me to get a job anywhere in the world and be paid extremely well - suggestions? I spent some time in the northeast, I really like it there, but I'm also open to other locations. 5. Will relationships work if your immediate interests or hobbies aren't similar? Obviously my interests are somewhat narrow at the moment, so I don't know whether I'll enjoy their interests or not unless I was to try it. Any other advice you can provide on where you would start, would be appreciated. I apologize for the long post and any spelling errors (somewhat went past medication time writing this), I just wanted to acquire some feedback on this. I'm not sure when I'll start the search, but definitely once my physical appearance improves after I can start visiting the gym. I have some physical therapy to complete before that happens. Thanks in advance. tldr - had terminal illness, no longer terminal thanks to new treatment, but still chronic. Looking for advice regarding where to start from here, in terms of relationships. Few questions above. I'd still suggest reading the whole post because most context won't fit in the tldr.	relationships
I am beyond frustrated	"*Update:* Stuff's been happening. I'm now scheduled to see the forensic psychologist myself, and provide my own materials. At his request. I'm feeling slightly less fear and despair. Thanks, everyone, for the thoughtful responses and kind words. It's nice to have a place to complain! And /u/cookieredditor - dang, dude, you are thoughtful and well put-together. I'm impressed and cheering for you! I've got to embrace a calm stoicism if I'm to get through this. Better to freak out online than in public I guess. ... So, the deal was that I was supposed to be able to meet with and give my materials to the psychologist performing the psychological evaluation on my uBPD STBX (so he'd not be working in an information vacuum). This was all worked out and agreed upon. Today she goes in for the eval. News to me! I remember reading here that Borderlines pass something like 90% of MPPI tests, or whatever. I don't know what methods this forensic psychologist uses, but now I'm very, very nervous. The over-applied crazy bright red crooked lipstick alone should have tipped him off, but who knows? This endeavor may have been a wasted gamble. I'll still have to pay for it, somehow (I'm broke). I am beyond unhappy with my attorney. But, alas, I cannot afford another. I contacted her office about it this morning. Zero response. The kid exchange tonight was brutal. We're going to have to exchange at the police stations from now on. The accusations, the lectures, the threats (daddy's going to sue you for &amp;amp;lt;x&gt;, accuse you of bank fraud felony &amp;amp;lt;y&gt;, your momma's going to prison, you're such a fag, my daddy's suing you for violating my privacy by recording me and it's a felony, I *loved* you, I feel threatened!, you're violent, etc. etc.). She says the eval ""went very well."" Of course, we wait and see for actual results. Last week she was completely unhinged, threatening me over text every 10 minutes. This morning, before the eval, oh-so polite and stable. After the eval, nasty again. BPDs ""can't help it"" my ass. They're not diseased. I'm convinced they're intentionally evil. If this nutjob is allowed to go undiagnosed, I don't know what to do. I may not win the custody case. I may be too broke to win the custody case. I may not be able to shake off every false accusation (she can stir up lots of court trouble). She may not get the help she needs. I may be doomed to two decades of dealing with this monster, untreated. I don't know how to face 16 years of this. How will our kids come away undamaged?! Oh, and I was a day late on my interrogatory (it's not a month, but ""28 days""), so her attorney wants to push on that. I'm tired of this bullshit."	BPDlovedones
Either I [F22] am an asshole, or my friends [F23, M25] are, and I'm not sure what to do either way	"I'm only mentioning two of my friends here (let's call them Max and Splendid, because obviously I love the new Mad Max movie), because they're really my only two super-close friends. I do have other more casual friends from work, with whom I'll get drinks or see a movie sometimes, but these two are really the only ones who spend time at my house and so on, and that's where the problem arises. To get right to the crux of the issue: I have OCD. Not in the ""ooh, I like to color-code things"" sense, in the ""crippling anxiety and strange ritual-like behaviors"" sense. I'm not as bad off as some people, but it definitely affects my life negatively. *******Begin possibly boring/unnecessary backstory******* This largely stems from my upbringing. My dad was never around, and my mom had some undiagnosed mental illness, so my home life was turbulent and in some cases straight-up abusive. For example, my little sister and I were often forced to eat food that had gone bad, which would make us very sick, because, ""you kids are just being picky and don't want to eat your food"". We also had little to no access to healthcare - not because my family couldn't afford it, but because my mom was always convinced we were ""faking it"" - so if we got sick or injured, we were basically fucked. I still have some hearing loss from an untreated ear infection. We were gaslighted constantly...not intentionally on my mom's part, but she would hallucinate something we'd ""done"" and then punish us for it, fully convinced that we'd done something that never happened. *******End possibly boring/unnecessary backstory******* I like to think I've done pretty well for myself despite all that - I have a good job in the field I went to college for, I have no debt, I have a healthy and loving relationship with my boyfriend - but some of the effects are still there. These largely have to do with cleanliness and fear of germs/illness. Examples include: * Panic attacks for days or weeks before holidays and big events (friends'/family's birthdays, Christmas, etc) because I'm so afraid I'm going to accidentally get someone I love sick or harm them somehow. * Needing to keep my living space clean. Most of it I'm actually relatively sane about, but I'm genuinely obsessive about the kitchen (again, fear of foodborne illness). * Needlessly frequent hand-washing. * Paranoia about infectious diseases and bodily fluids - internally freaking out if someone I doesn't know touches my bare skin, fear of peoples' blood, etc. * Keeping all my stuff in very specific places (e.g. keys stay on the counter if I'm in the house, scissors always in the top drawer, etc). This is less due to liking organization, and more due to the fact that I measure my own sanity by my ability to keep track of things. I don't always trust my own memory, so misplacing/losing things is really upsetting to me. Believe it or not, this is actually leaps and bounds better than I used to be (thanks to therapy). Six years ago my hands were permanently cracked and bleeding from overwashing, and I was probably two steps away from being a genuine shut-in because I was so terrified of the outside world. Splendid pretty much knows my life story, as we've been friends since middle school and she witnessed, firsthand, some of what I went through. Max is a more recent friend from college, but he and Splendid and I click great. I know I'm not painting the most flattering picture of them here, but they really are unusually great friends to me in most ways. Here's the thing, though; no matter how many times I ask them to avoid doing certain things that trigger my OCD, it seems like they either forget, or start doing something similar but not exactly the same. And while I try to ignore the smaller things and control my reactions, I feel like some of the things they do would be considered rude even by a ""normal"" person. Some examples: * I bought a brand new car less than a month ago, after saving and only riding a bike for years. Max got into my car and put his feet up on the dashboard, getting dirt and grass everywhere. When I got home, I had to spend 30 minutes cleaning the inside of my car before I felt it was ""safe"" again. * Splendid will regularly come into my house and throw all her stuff (backpack, ice skates, notebooks, bike helmet, whatever) onto my kitchen countertop. I ask her every time to please put it on the couch or someplace else where food doesn't go, but she always forgets. * Max often drinks/eats things of mine without asking. For example, he came over the other day (already tipsy) and I'd left a 3/4-empty bottle of bourbon on the kitchen table. I turned around to do something, and when I turned back he was drinking straight from the bottle. I ended up having to throw it away because I had a stupid irrational panic attack about his saliva being on/in it. It's not so much that I mourn the loss of that particular bourbon, but I was kind of baffled; I'd never just walk into someone's house and put my mouth on their liquor bottles. * Splendid will often leave stuff of mine in random places instead of where she found it. She always asks before using things, which I appreciate, but then she'll leave it in another room or cram it in a drawer somewhere and I won't be able to find it when I need it, which I find unreasonably upsetting. I don't know what to think of this. On the one hand, I know I'm truly uptight and that can't be fun to be around. It's not fair of me to impose my genuinely crazy standards on the people around me, because my mental health problems aren't their responsibility. On the other hand, it's getting to a point where I don't feel comfortable having Max or Splendid in my living space anymore. I love seeing them, and they're always genuinely sorry when I tell them to please stop doing something, but I still end up feeling unclean and emotionally exhausted once they leave. I guess I just want some outside perspective on this (besides my therapist's, but it's kind of her job to be supportive so I don't think she's particularly unbiased here). Please, don't be hesitant to give me an attitude check if I'm being horrible to my friends - at this point, I think I may need it. **tl;dr: I've got a stick up my ass compared to my two best friends, due to OCD, and it's causing friction. I don't know whether they're being genuinely rude and inconsiderate, or I'm being demanding and hypersensitive. Wanting as much perspective and as many opinions as I can get.**"	relationships
Undiagnosed. Seeking help and advice.	Hi Docs, I'm a 30 yr old white male. I live in the Midwest and I've been undiagnosed ill for almost 2 years now. I'm pretty resigned to my life or being sick, but I'm also still very desperate. This all started abruptly for me. I was a body builder at the time. 6'1 235 lbs - mostly muscle. I lifted everyday. One day, right after my workout I had ad adverse reaction. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I felt like I was going to collapse. I felt hypoglycemic. I felt like I needed food, and I couldn't get enough food in my body fast enough. This basically put me in an all out panic. Eventually, once I got enough calories in my body, I started to level out. Although I felt bad afterward (headache, fatigue, general feeling of being unwell). Since then I've never felt the same. I had to stop working out because every time I tried I had the same reaction. I then started feeling that way even when I did not work out. Everyday became a struggle to get up for work and get through the day. I would goto to ER and my Comelet Blood Panel would come back fine. Liver AST slightly elevated. Blood pressure sky high. They would send me home as being mental. It got to the point where I could no longer take care of myself. Everyday I felt like I was dying and that crazy feeling of the gym that day. Hypoglycemia is the best way I know how to describe it. I became bed ridden and I just felt like shit all the time. I became very fatigue and slept a lot. Physical activity made me feel worse. I was drinking my meals because I couldn't get the food in quick enough and when I did eat I couldn't stomach it. But I felt like if I didn't get calories in my body I was going to die. One doctor finally said I had mononucleosis. Other doctors disagreed. Tests showed I had the antibody but had beaten the epstien barr virus already. It became very frustrating as you may imagine. This went on for about 6 months. When finally they said I had low testosterone. They gave me a Testosterone supplement, which helped slightly. This didn't make me feel like death everyday, and eventually I could do more physical activity. Fast forward to present day. I've put on 100 pounds since becoming sick (about 1.5 years). I'm still very fatigued. I still feel hypoglycemic everyday. I'm able to eat more solid foods but I still end up needed to drink high calorie liquids because I feel like I go into a panic if I do not. I'm on medicine to bring down my insulin, which I think is because of my weight gain. I cant stand The hot summer heat and sun. It drains me. They have checked my blood sugar when I'm having one of my spells and it is fine and in range. They tell me I am not diabetic. No doctor can seem to help me. Basic blood screening does not show anything unordinary. I have tested negative for Lyme disease (I don't think I have it). I also wen to the MayoClinc. They put me through the ringer. They ruled out any current infections diseases and sent me home as a mental case. Its my hope that someone will read this, who is an outside the box thinker, and have an idea of what it might be... or have some advice for me, as what I can do to get better. God bless you all.

Help a deserving Man U fan	"Posting on behalf of a friend for her husband and outstanding man. Please give this story a chance and help a dream come true. ""Dear Manchester United, My name is Alexi and my husband and I are going to be at the Man U game in Seattle this Friday night (7/17). I'm trying everything I can possibly think of and I'm not sure who I should contact, but I have a special request: My husband has loved Manchester United for his entire life. He is a remarkable young man who gets up as early as necessary to watch the team play on TV and has spent countless hours watching highlights on YouTube. He even played on an indoor soccer team of the name Man-chest-hair United. He really loves you guys. I know this is asking a lot, but if there were any way he could meet the team this Friday, I would be forever grateful. If his devotion to the team is not enough for this request to be met, please read about why I believe he deserves this once in a lifetime opportunity. I promise it will only take a few, short minutes of your time. At 16 years old, I started showing symptoms that went undiagnosed for months. After many tests, procedures, and hospital visits, I was diagnosed with Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis, Endometriosis, and Ulcerative Colitis (Neil has also informed me that a former Man U player, Darren Fletcher, is also a fighter of Ulcerative Colitis). When I was 17, I met Neil at a high school youth group. He did not care that I was diseased and decided I was worth pursuing. He has loved me with the most unconditional, unwavering love. When we were 19 years old, we felt that God had brought us together for a reason, so we got married. We both were attending Oregon State University at the time and we were able to live almost normal lives as I had seemed to be cured after a year and a half of no symptoms. However, things took a turn for the worst in early 2014 while on a mission trip to Sao Paulo, Brazil. It was my senior year in college and Neil was a junior studying Civil Engineering. I became very ill while on the mission trip and had very severe flare ups of my Vasculitis and Colitis. We were devastated to learn that I was not cured, but only in remission. My Vasculitis makes it nearly impossible for me to walk. Neil has always taken it upon himself to physically carry me wherever I need to go whenever I flare with the Vasculitis. My colitis had been very mild for the first 5 years since I developed symptoms, but since Brazil, it started to become more and more severe. I was able to finish my degree in Human Development and Family Sciences in the summer of 2014. That Fall, I started working as a preschool teacher to help support Neil as he continued toward earning his degree. However, that Winter, I ended up being hospitalized twice and was forced to quit my job as I am now on a medicine that, in short, shuts down my immune system. This makes me extremely vulnerable to catching illnesses which can then make my diseases even worse. Neil had just gone on another mission trip to Brazil and Skyped me as often as he could to help me cope and make difficult decisions. Earlier this year, I ended up being hospitalized two more times with a 10 day ""break"" in between. I spent a month in the hospital this time. The second hospitalization was a desperate attempt to save my life. Due to my Ulcerative Colitis, I ended up losing over 20% of my body weight in a matter of months and was no longer able to even feed myself. Keep in mind, Neil was still in college at this time. He was with me every chance he had, even if that meant he had to drive a few hours in the early morning to make it back to his classes in time. I cannot count the times he stayed over night with me and getting next to no sleep because I needed so much help with basic tasks. I ended up having to get a tube placed in my arm that extended to my heart. This tube required many sanitary precautions so that I could receive nutrition therapy without getting an infection. Neil learned all of those precautions and took care of me in our apartment as I had the tube in my arm for an additional week after I was released from the hospital. Not only was he in college while dealing with this, he took up work in our church to help with bills as I was no longer able to provide for us financially. Since then, he has graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering, earned an internship at an engineering company with offices worldwide, and been accepted into the Master's program at Oregon State University for Structural Engineering. His only goals have been formed by making sure he will be able to take care of me. His love is my best medicine. Today, I am almost in remission with my diseases and I owe so much of that to him. I know that there is nothing I could possibly do that would repay him for his sacrifices. However, meeting the Manchester United team would definitely be unforgettable for him! I know you must receive requests like these all of the time. But, here I am, begging you to honor my husband for his incredible character and devotion to not only soccer, but to his family and the Lord. P.S. We are also going to the game to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary and his 22nd birthday. What a gift that would be!! Thank you for considering my request"" She has posted this story to every teammates Facebook profile and is at a loss as to what to do next. I know and have witnessed the community of Reddit. Hopefully someone who reads this can help this couple reach the team and make an experience like none other. Edit: Update! They were able to get in contact with the team tour manager, I believe, and received two passes along with about 25 other guests to meet with the team. They were able to meet with the team and get a bunch of pictures. Thank you all for your support and ideas. Getting in contact with the Supporters Club was what then lead her to get in contact with their tour manager. They are so grateful to all whole helped. Truly a once in a lifetime experience."	reddevils
$BGMD - discussion of science	"I'm not invested in $BGMD yet, but the threads on this forum have perked my interest about this company, stock, and Gal-3. I've been reading through past threads and saw a resident (castalmond) discussing the science behind and applications for Gal-3 and I would like to discuss his comment in a new thread since that one is a month old and buried. &amp;nbsp; **Castalmond:** ""I'm not too impressed with the predictive value of the test. Sensitivity 62.9%, specificity 90%. Most commonly used marker right now is BNP, which has a higher sensitivity but lower specificity than gal-3. IMO specificity is less important (if someone comes in with clinical signs of CHF, i.e SOB, weight gain, reduced urine output, then why do you need a confirmatory test besides echocardiogram?). With the current medical landscape focusing on cost cutting, practically I don't see a good use for another CHF marker. The question that doctors will ask when ordering a test is, ""will it change management?"" In that regard, will a high gal-3 change beta-blocker, afterload reducing, or diuretic therapy? Dry weight is probably a more accurate measure of CHF exacerbation anyway. Can this marker be used to find undiagnosed HFpEF? Probably, but will insurances cover screening everyone in the population, or do you need to have certain risk factors (high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, etc)? It might end up being like prostate cancer screening with a PSA - the false positives are too high and may result in more unnecessary tests. The elephant in the room is NT-proBNP, which is a much better diagnostic marker and predictor of mortality than BNP. Most institutions in the United States have been relying on BNP due to the cost of NT-proBNP (some think it's because medicaid doesn't want to find more CHF patients, which will drive up medical costs), but it's gaining traction slowly. This test has been widely available in Europe for several years. tl;dr Is this marker a better diagnostic tool than available markers? Will it change medical management? Will insurances pay for it?"" &amp;nbsp; **My thoughts:** I'm not invested in this BGMD...yet, but I'm doing my DD and interested in discussing the points you bring up. To me, when presented with these symptoms, first thing I think of is CHF, and running a BNP test and having it come back positive will confirm the diagnosis, but if it comes back negative doesn't tell me anything, it doesn't mean its not happening and doesn't let me make a conclusion. As a resident, you know that BNP only elevates during exacerbation of CHF and not during the interim. I'm actually very impressed by the predictive value of this test. I love higher specificity when looking at tests...it lets me rule in a disease. Higher sensitivity only let me rule out diseases. Hypothetically, if we are evaluating healthy people, sensitivity would be more important and BNP wins out. However, with the aging population of baby boomers, and you and I know everyone over 65 has hypertension and heart failure, specificity is more important when diagnosing unhealthy people (ie. Gal-3 wins). However, in the end we may be comparing apples to oranges here. BNP is used for diagnosing systolic heart failure (HFrEF). For those who don't know, in patients with HFrEF ejection fraction is decreased. Gal-3 is most likely going to be used for diagnosing diastolic heart failure (HFpEF). In patients with HFpEF, ejection fraction is preserved, the heart is stiff and fibrotic (not dilating) and thus not producing BNP to be detected. Yeah, I know any new tests will be hard to get doctors to adopt it, but if it is going to be part of automatic screenings, I think it might be an important and in demand test for our aging baby boomers and you know the whole big push for preventative medicine/screening blah blah blah (one for Gal-3). However, in my opinion systolic heart failure is more prevalent so that's one for BNP. And oh, irrelevant but something you brought up, I think its untrue what you said about medicaid and not wanting to find CHF, everyone older has HF, and I know only the VA runs NT-proBNP... all the regular hospitals use BNP"	wallstreetbets
Me [49 M] with my wife [39 F] of 12 years, am wanting to hug her and punch a hole in the wall	"My wife of 12 year had asked for a divorce from me on April 1, saying she didn't love me and didn't want to work things out. She also admitted to an affair of almost 1 year. I got her to agree to counseling and had mostly forgiven her for her actions as she had to deal with me in a deep depression for 5 years due to undiagnosed bi-polarism. She came to me this morning to tell me that she got her test results back from her yearly exam and she had tested positive for the HPV virus...the bad one..the one that causes cancer. She had been tested last year during her physical and had tested negative so the only person she could have transmitted it to her was her ""lover"". I am fucked up at the moment. She admitted that she had been having unprotected sex with him for awhile, which meant he was fucking me as well as my wife and I were having unprotected sex. I want to hug her and tell her everything will be fine, that we can get through this as a couple, I want to go find him and burn down his house. I want to punch something, anything. I went to the gym and worked the bag, but the anger is still there. My wife and My wife and he have put me, her, even my kids in theory, at risk of developing cancer because of this. I don't even know what I am wanting advice on, it just seems like god has it in for me lately with the diagnosis of Bi-polar, the divorce, the infidelity and now this. tl;dr; Wife contracted a cancer causing venereal disease and given it to me. **tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!"	relationships
Living with pain!	Stomach issues..poor diet...periods of constipation and diarrhea...mostly constipation..over worked..sitting at desk all day. No menstrual period in over 18 days. Bloated. Stomach hurts every time I eat. Feeling so moody and frustrated. Feeling judged by family because they don't believe my pain. Pretty sure it is an undiagnosed disease. Going to get tested soon.	offmychest
Can Gabapentin/Neurontin cause massive and abrupt weight gain? (RANT WITH MANY QUESTIONS)	"Hello all! I'm a 35 year old, female...happily married and mother of two teenagers. I am also a chronic pain patient. I suffer from an (as of yet) undiagnosed post-infection autoimmune disorder I contracted after having a severe case of CDiff. I was hospitalized in late 2013 with the bacterial infection and before the illness I was happy, thin and pretty damn healthy, besides some lumbago pain stemming from 2 compression fractures in my L4 and 5 disks. At that time, my pain was pretty well controlled with Tramadol daily and Roxicodone for the really bad days. Ok, so fast forward to now, they still don't know what's wrong with me. The only things they know for certain is the illness had given me hypothyroidism and they also discovered I have PCOS, although I'm positive that one is not related to the CDiff. The only diseases that have been officially ruled out have been MS and Sjrogens. Their next guess is RA and while I do have quite a few (read: many) symptoms of RA my blood test came back negative. Thinking I could be serum negative my PCP decided to refer me to a Rheumy. Their first appointment isn't until August. Ugh. I was told to call everyday to check for any cancelations but no luck so far. I should add that we are also looking into Hashi's. Anyway, I have so many questions and rants I want to eventually post but this particular post is about Gabapentin. I'm prescribed 900 to 1200 mgs before bed for nerve pain in my lower legs, RLS and insomnia. Fortunately, it works pretty damn great for all three maladies. I just have to make sure I go right to bed after I take it or I turn into a hilarious drunken baby otherwise. Also, sometimes I'm still ""drunk"" when I wake up, but I figure it's a small price to pay for the relief it brings me. Ok, but here's what I'm wondering. Does gaba cause a substantial weight gain in an absurdly short amount of time? I usually read up on all newly prescribed meds but I don't recall reading anything about weight gain for this one... Big mistake on my part. But let me back up a moment before I get into that. The day before I was hospitalized with CDiff I was a fairly healthy 5'2"" and 135lbs. I was a structural welder/heavy steel fabricator and played roller derby. I now weigh 190lbs, am unemployed and forced to walk with a cane. Most of the weight gain I assume is from the hypothyroidism (still not fully under control even with the 100mcgs a day of synthyroid) and the PCOS. (I see an Endo in Sept to address both these issues). But up until I started the gaba about 3 months ago I was a steady 170lbs. I gained this latest 20lbs swift and with a venegence, and mainly in my midsection. I started putting two and two together as this all happened within the 3 months I was taking the gaba. But online I keep getting conflicting reports. I read weight gain OR loss can be a side effect. Nothing concrete. So my question to you fine folks is simply... What do you think? Do you think this latest round of weight gain can be from the gaba? I mean I even recently joined a gym and although I focus mainly on cardio I actually gained 5lbs my first week there and trust me it wasn't ""muscle mass"" either lol I mean besides my illnesses I am on a fuck-ton of other meds. I'll list them so you can get a better understanding of my story. They are in no particular order: the gabapentin, morphine sulfate ER, roxicodone, synthyroid, diazapam, adderall, and birth control pills. I also take vitamin D which does fuck all for me but that's besides the point lol Obviously I realize I'm on a lot of meds and I'm sure they are all in some way partially responsible for some of the weight gain (well besides the synthyroid and adderall probably) but do you think the gaba is what put this last 20lbs on me? I also read that it's hard to lose the weight gained by taking gaba so that's why I'm a little worried. Even though these pills help me, the weight is making everything worse. So if I think it'll help me lose some pounds I'll take myself off the gaba, under my pcp's supervision of course! So yeah, I'll appreciate any and all advice regarding the gaba use/weight gain as well as anything else y'all have for me regarding any of my other issues, the illnesses, meds, upcoming specialist appointments, etc. I'm not a big fan of therapists so being a part of this sub has been extremely beneficial for me. I haven't posted much but even just reading other people's posts have helped me out in the short amount of time I've been a member. I can't wait to read your responses and advice as well as getting to know some of you and to start interacting with people who finally fucking ""get"" me. TL; DR... Sorry but there is none. I take adderall for ADD, so this is just simply crazy, oftentimes manic me. I won't apologize for my crazy rants because soon enough y'all will start to love me and my 1,000 word ramblings ;) EDITED FOR TYPOS."	ChronicPain
Did thyroid disease make you any of these things (or act like this even only occasionally): asshole, bitch, narcissist?	As in, you acted like one of these and it turned out to be because of thyroid disease, either undiagnosed, untreated or undertreated.

Irritation, redness and pain on glans. Recurrent balanitis? Help!	27 year old, male, 180 lbs, 5'9, Asian, 5 years of problems. Penis glans and skin uncircumcised. I've been getting bouts of continuous recurring balanitis and jock itch around inner thighs. Also have history of eczema, dry skin and dandruff. It all started around College when I thought I had a STD. Goto school clinic and negative for all. This goes away after maybe 1 year. Following this I get a recurrent bout of inflammation, redness, tenderness and pain. I go see doctor again run blood tests for STD comes back negative. I'm prescribed nystatin triamcholone and it responds right away. Problem is after stopping use it comes back after maybe 3 days after sexual intercourse or masturbation. I'm not the cleanest person in the world but I take regular showers. Each episode of outbreak if I apply nystatin and triamcholone it goes away within 24 hours finish the treatment it comes back again. I'm frustrated because it's very painful and a big inconvenience. I'm also worried about long term effects this has on me. I've seen countless doctors ranging from rheumatologist, allergist, dermatologist to primary care and none can provide treatment. No one has tested me for diabetes which I will be seeking tomorrow. Anyone have any similar experiences with a recurrent balanitis? Each time I goto a new doctor they go thru the spiel with me with STI testing etc and only prescribe me medicine for my symptoms not really treating the cause. I have SSA 3 antibody deficiency but no one seems to be too concerned about that. Could this be the cause of my overreactive case of infections? Cause of my dandruff? Do I have some sort of undiagnosed autoimmune disease?	AskDocs
High Functioning Bipolar 2, what is it like?	"**Disclaimer: I am not asking for a diagnosis, and I will talk about this with my therapist soon enough, all I want is to know what is life like overall for people with Bipolar 2 that are considered high functioning (without medication).** **TL;DR: Sorry for the wall of text!. I have been feeling strange for the past 2 years and have only recently noticed that my symptoms may correlate with Bipolar 2, but I don't know if I should wait and see if they continue (the last year has been a strange year), or to ask for a psychiatric evaluation, especially when I feel normal now after coming out of a deep depression.** A therapist has recently asked me to consider a Bipolar 2 diagnosis. I have been seeing her after loosing my job (I put myself in a position to be laid off by refusing to work on a project), and having periods of depression and just overall feeling very angry and “off” shall we say. After I told her that there are periods where I feel euphoric, she mentioned the possibility of Bipolar 2. It seems that bipolar disorder runs on a pretty wide spectrum, and it may be possible that there are people who live life undiagnosed (especially on the Bipolar 2-Cyclothymia end). I understand that online communities could possibly be biased towards people who experience the disease more severely (uncontrollable mania, psychosis, suicide attempts, etc). I also understand that Bipolar 1 may be easier to diagnose, as an episode of mania is unlikely to go unnoticed. I will share my experience in here, in hopes that maybe somebody who has had similar issues will find it through Google as well. I am at a point where it is hard to determine what is personality and what is a mood disorder. What is caused by social anxiety and learned helplessness and what isn’t. What is caused by living alone, and what isn’t. What I do know is that I often have wild mood shifts within the same month, and often from day to day. But most of the time it takes weeks or months for my moods to shift into definite points of depression and joyfulness. Every so often I have periods of severe depression (staying at home for 1 month, not eating (to the point when you actually eat again it is hard to), oversleeping (until you have headaches) feeling hopeless, self harm thoughts and actions). After I got laid off, I didn't feel depressed, I was going to do something else with my life (travel, get another job), until I ""switched"" and just got incredibly depressed. Energy and sexual desire are obviously not tied to personality, and those vary widely over the course of a year. Besides living alone, having no relationships at all (just turned 26, I push everybody away), and few friendships, I would be considered high functioning because I have been able to hold steady high paying jobs in the software industry. As long as you have money and a stable house, everybody seems to think you are OK. ***** **There are weeks of mild-moderate depression:** * Wanting to disappear (every morning before I go to work), hopelessness. * Feelings of deep emptiness and loneliness (even amongst people). * Thoughts about me being a failure in life. * Suicidal thoughts (no attempts), which I find comforting to think about. * Constant tiredness (can’t fall asleep, can’t wake up in the morning to go to work) * Fatigue (pass out at 6pm when coming home from work, wake up at midnight, stay up for a few hours, eat, then go to sleep and wake up tired again) * Absolute lack of sexual desire. You essentially feel nothing for the opposite sex. * Shifting appetite (able to eat once a day and be ok, or sometimes I can’t stop eating and I will gain weight). * No energy to go out and meet new people or do new activities, which everybody tells me I should be doing. * Intrusive thoughts at times. Constant negative self talk. The intrusive thoughts are the worst, when they don't stop they will make you want to rip your hair out. * House is a mess most of the time. * Low self esteem * Anger and irritation at minor things I rarely feel sad though. These periods cause me to be socially isolated, and not live life. People have told me that I am a “hermit”. I am very quiet for the most part. People tell me that I isolate myself. I haven't sought out help for this ""depression"" I've felt for years, because I don't feel it is severe enough, I think it may just be me living day to day life. ***** **Then there are periods of what could be considered hypomania, these could last a few days, or sometimes a few weeks:** * I love my life, loneliness doesn’t bother me, I think I am fantastic and great. I will walk the streets smiling and thinking how great everything is, the city, my job, everything. * Colors seem more vivid (I will be obsessed over bright neon colors), music is alive (every note just touches your being, especially upbeat music), it just feels different. I will run to work, I can’t even stay still waiting for the bus, I will walk-run to the next station while I wait its arrival. Sensations are heightened. * Feel the need to run (even when I am with other people). Lots of agitation and pacing. There are times where I can’t stop pacing from one end of my house to e other thinking about things. * More talkative, higher self esteem. Pressure to say things or talk to people. People have told me to “shut up” at work. * I have periods where I clean my house intensely, or go to fix things in other people's houses. I will wake up early after not sleeping much to rearrange a kitchen to make it more efficient. * These are the periods where I want to live life and go everywhere, I have booked trips to Europe for just 3 days (flying from the US). * Feeling religious and mystical, connected with the universe. * Feel speeded up, able to complete tons of tasks in a given week, to the point where people are impressed by my speed. * At certain times feelings of hypersexuality, wanting to have sex with everybody (which is frankly annoying) * Start a bunch of projects that I give up after 2 weeks or so. (no energy to keep working on them) * Increased spending at points, but it never causes any financial damage because of a high paying job. * Racing thoughts, able to do thousands of things at once, code and listen to music, and answer emails, and talk to the person next to me, all at once. Honestly, it feels amazing to live life like that, everything is wonderful. The physical agitation is sometimes too much (when I can’t stop pacing, or I am not able to sit still), and I have said things I regret at work and have caused me trouble. ***** There are periods where I am just incredibly angry at people for stupid things, or I will cut off all contact, only to change my mind a few weeks later. It honestly feels like living life and seeing life through very different lenses, like wearing dark sunglasses, and being on drugs on the other end. I had a brief incident earlier this year (during a stressful family situation) in which I heard a voice and had paranoid delusional thoughts about somebody wanting to kill me. It was only one night though and I haven't worried much about it, this was the first time something like this happened. The days before I felt really depressed but also couldn't stop pacing and thinking about the situation that was unfolding. Somebody said I was talking when I don’t remember talking out loud, just thinking quickly by myself in bed. Not sure what it means, but I try to live a stress free life since I know I don't handle it well. **And then there are periods where you feel normal, and you just go through life, you are neither depressed or hypomanic, distracted by day to day work and responsibilities. But you deal with the consequences of both, the social isolation, or your ruined reputation at work because you said things that were considered “irreverent”.** I really do not know what is normal, since I had severe depression when I was a teenager (failed school, didn’t go to college). Don’t really know if it is depression, or just my personality that turned out this way. People have told me that I seem to have a depressive personality. Yet me knowing what severe depression is, I haven't sought out help, since I know it can be much worse. Being socially isolated makes it hard to have an objective judge, but people have said that I am very ""binary"" or ""black and white"". Nobody has questioned my mental health or labeled me Bipolar though. (I have asked people recently and nobody seems to be able to get over the fact that you need to be completely manic out of your mind to be bipolar) I am unsure also how hypomania would manifest itself in an overall introverted and socially isolated individual. But I know I feel different. ***** **My question to all of you, is this what a ""high functioning"" Bipolar 2 looks like, what have been your experiences?** I don’t know when it crosses to the point of being a diagnosable disorder, I’ve always had these symptoms to some extent, but in the last 2 years they have just gotten worse. I have gotten to the point where I have cried and said I don’t want to live life like this anymore, but I somehow know that I won’t have the energy/motivation to change what is wrong. One week later I am fine and I don't feel those emotions. Right now I feel normal, and I would feel weird telling this story to a psychiatrist. It doesn't feel ""severe"" enough, especially after reading the experiences posted here. Somehow I hate feeling ""normal"" now that I am aware of how I shift throughout the year. I feel that everything that happened to me recently, will somehow happen again."	BipolarReddit
Here is a fact sheet that may help you the next time you go to the doctor	Factsheets for Docs-on-the-go: Chiari-1 Malformation©2005 SJ Rodgers, Educational Therapist, and Danny Whitehead, M.D. Endorsed by Paolo Bolognese, M.D., Associate Director of The Chiari Institute You know how to recognize multiple sclerosis (MS) – you probably have several cases in your busy practice.You also expect to add one or two new cases every year, because you know that 400,000 Americans have MS, and that another 200 are diagnosed every week: 1. MS is rare, but not uncommon, so it doesn’ t surprise you. 2 .Did you know that similar numbers apply to Chiari-1 Malformation? 3. How many Chiarians have you identified in your practice? Most cases of Chiari are left undiagnosed, or worse, misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, migraine, fibromyalgia, or psychiatric disturbances, a common error that prevents physically ill Chiari patients from getting the kind of help they need and deserve. 4.Let’s take a closer look. 5.Chiari-1 Malformation is properly defined as a mesodermal anomaly, a deformity of the posterior cranial fossa boundaries, most notably the occipital bone, but also the tentorium, clivus, basion and opisthion.The deformity subtly compresses the cerebellum and often the occipital lobe, brainstem, and/or spinal cord, too. The cerebellar tonsils herniate into the foramen magnum and may occupy a small portion of the upper cervical spinal canal . They are visible on mid-sagittal and slighty parasagittal MRIs . However, in some cases, the tonsils wrap around the brainstem or curl up like tiny snails; then their appearance is more subtle, but their effect is just as debilitating .The reason for symptom and sign manifestation – and an important key to the severity of a case – is the deformity’s effect on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics. 6.When CSF flow is turbulent, reduced, or absent in one or more locations, adjacent brain tissue receives little nutritional support, cellular by product removal, or cushioning from the effects of mechanical or Valsalva maneuvers 7. Brain function in the affected areas is disturbed. Naturally, patients report debilitating effects that correspond to the malfunction of the affected brain parts. 8. Symptoms and signs can number into the dozens, can appear to exist in unrelated systems, and can wax and wane as influential factors change. How can you identify your Chiarians? (Yes, you do have some.) The easiest way to identify Chiarians is by cataloguing their complaints in categories corresponding to brain anatomy: 9. listen for details indicating cerebellar, occipital lobe and brainstem malfunction, then add upper spinal cord symptoms, and the malfunction of midline structures such as the hypothalamus, amygdala, and pituitary gland 10. You’ll see a pattern that is unique to the patient’s anatomy; it matches the territory of the malformation and reflects defects in the patterns of cerebrospinal fluid flow. Order MRI scans to verify your clinical observations. MRI of the brain will show subtle structural defects in addition to any obvious tonsillar herniation. An MRI of the entire spine will rule out or confirm a syrinx; this fluid-filled cavity often accompanies Chiari and can be found anywhere in the spinal cord. A Ciné MRI of the cranio-cervical junction will outline CSF flow dynamics. Watch for diminished or absent flow, especially in the retro cerebellar spaces, and from the fourth ventricle between the brainstem and cerebellum. Hydrocephalus is not necessary for the diagnosis of Chiari. Keep in mind that subtle deformities within the posterior fossa, with or without frank herniation, can be more problematic in their effect on brain function than a large but simple ectopia that happens to leave room for normal fluid flow. This explains why short, thick cerebellar tonsils that barely plug the foramen magnum can cause a serious impediment, while a longer herniation that is thin or peg-shaped sometimes can cause few problems. Ok, so you realize you have a few Chiarians. Now what? Take good care of them. Typically they have been suffering for a long time, with no name for their assailant. Explain Chiari to your patients, and reassure them that they are not psychologically ill, that their compressed brain tissue and altered fluid dynamics do have measurable effects on their physical function. Encourage them to learn more . Then work as a team to decide which of several courses you’ll follow: 1) In cases with mild symptoms, encourage your patients to keep you informed of any changes, follow good health habits, and avoid physical activities that promote whiplash, such as trampolines, roller coasters, and contact sports; 2) 2) In cases with moderate symptoms, also consider trying a biochemical treatment such as Diamoxto reduce fluid production if indicated, or suggest a mechanical treatment such as cervical traction to increase space in the cranio-cervical junction ;3) 3) In cases with moderate to severe symptoms, do all of the above and encourage your patients to consult with a neurosurgeon who is very experienced with Chiari cases .Surgery for this debilitating malformation is a delicate art form; it requires a resculpting of the retrocerebellar spaces to create the missing cisterna magna and to redirect cerebrospinal fluid and establish proper flow dynamics in multiple planes. Two more points to consider: 1: Instruct your patients to report immediately any of the red-flag warning signs of severe brainstem compression: breathing difficulties, swallowing/choking problems, wild heart rate fluctuations, and/or drop attacks. When they call you, take action. Brainstem compression from Chiari can develop at a variable pace, and it has been known to KILL. 2: Familiarize yourself with the subtleties of this rare-but-common disease .

Worldwide, MS may affect 2.5 million individuals. “Until recent years, CM1 was regarded as a rare condition. With the increased availability of magnetic resonance imaging, the number of reported cases has risen sharply. Current estimates range from 200,000 to 2 million Americans with the condition. Genetic studies spearheaded by Dr. Milhorat support a hereditary tendency with a transmissibility rate of 12 percent. Women are affected three times more often than men.

Chemo done. Remission successful. So why 6 months later do I STILL feel horrible and exhausted?	"I have cll leukemia(also cerebral palsy that's mild but in the last decade or so has caused major chronic pain of it's own) and went through chemo with rituximab and Bendamustine . Achieved remission. However: 1. The spleen pain that initially sent me to the er and got me diagnosed is STILL HERE. Dr says they don't know why it still hurts. But it's more pain than I can ignore at the least and me sweating,unable to be upright/focus/be touched or speak at its worst. Bad ""attacks"" of the pain a few times a month. Luckily my awesome palliative care Dr has me on quick action pain meds for breakthrough pain and round the clock pain med otherwise. But why hasn't that gone away? 2. Kidney damage that requires me to take potassium 2 times a day or it drops to heart attack level in a day or two. Why didn't anyone warn me this might happen? 3.Major fatigue still. Can't be up and moving more than 10 minutes. I'll end up hurting sweating and feeling like I'm gonna faint. Ok while laying on couch or in bed. Can go to visit friends if we just literally sit around but even 3 hours of that and im done physically. 4. Taste and smell perversion like during chemo for no reason out of the blue 5. My internal medicine Dr said that even with remission I have a chronic disease and as such my immune system is gonna always be weakened and my body reacts negatively to the small bit of cancer that is always there. Is that true in anyone's experience? 6. People have told me that the chemo was a major damage to my body along with having undiagnosed stage 2-3 cll leukemia for probably a few years. The chemo is literally poison and the leukemia stresses every part of the body because it's in the blood. Could this account for all the stuff im still going through? Just curious what fellow cancer patients have gone through and if they got all the way better. Also has your cancer experience left you with chronic pain? How common is this?"	cancer
2nd International Conference on Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics	Gynecology-2015 has been designed in an interdisciplinary manner with a multitude of tracks to choose from every segment and provides you with a unique opportunity to meet up with peers from both industry and academia and establish a scientific network between them. We cordially invite all concerned people to come join us at our event and make it successful by your participation. A comprehensive range of topics will be discussed in the event including maternal fetal medicine, gynecology oncology, Sexual medicine, Substance Use &amp; abuse, ultrasound diagnosis, Menstruation, leukoaraiosis, Endometriosis, Body Mass Index, genitourinary medicine, and Gynecologic Cancers. At OMICS, It is our ideology to bring maximum exposure to our attendees, so we make sure the event is a blend which covers professionals such as gynecologists, obstetricians, veteran researchers, women healthcare professionals from academia &amp;industry making the conference a perfect platform. Track 1. Midwifery : Midwifery is a broad topic and is professional in gynecology and No. of Research institutes working on the Midwifery approximately 20 or more then that as well as some university are also who gave training for to women to be midwifery and most of midwives are women, total number of university are approximately 60 working on midwifes and also funding are $10000- $20000 and 30% industry, Academia 40% and Others 30% are include at this topic. The midwife is the professional in obstetrics. The term is used in reference to both women and men, although most midwives are female. According to the definition of the International Confederation of Midwives, which has also been adopted by the World Health Organization and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics: A midwife is a person who, having been regularly admitted to a midwifery educational program that is duly recognized in the country in which it is located, has successfully completed the prescribed course of studies in midwifery and has acquired the requisite qualifications to be registered and/or legally licensed to practice midwifery. Midwifery in low income countries like Egypt, Pakistan, India, Uzbekistan, Ethiopia, Baluchistan and some of the region of south America and other countries. Midwifery was reintroduced as a regulated profession in most of Canada's ten provinces in the 1990s. After several decades of intensive political lobbying by midwives and consumers, fully integrated, regulated and publicly funded midwifery is now part of the health system in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, and in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Midwifery legislation has recently been proclaimed in New Brunswick where the government is in the process of integrating midwifery services there. Only Prince Edward Island, Yukon and Newfoundland and Labrador do not have legislation in place for the practice of midwifery. Midwifery care is recognized as a responsible and accountable professional who works in partnership with women to give the necessary support, care, and advice during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period; to conduct births on the midwife's own responsibility; and to provide care for the infant. This care includes preventive measures, the promotion of normal birth, the detection of complications in mother and child, accessing of medical or other appropriate assistance, and the carrying out of emergency measures. A midwife who is credentialed appropriately is qualified to practice in any setting including in the home, the community, hospitals, clinics or health units. Recent developments in midwifery research in all four countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands) different courses, in timing as well as content, characterized its development in the individual countries. Major factors contributing to this development during the last decades involved the history and character of midwifery, initiatives of individual midwifery researchers, alliances with other professions and the transition of midwifery programmers into higher education. Whereas midwifery research is currently established as a professional role in all countries, future challenges involve the creation of its own profile and identity, while building up its own academic workforce and strengthening the role of midwifery in multidisciplinary alliances. The role of multi-ethnic community midwives include the initial appointments with pregnant women, managing clinics, postnatal care in the home, and attending home births. A community midwife would typically have a pager and be responsible for a particular area, contacted by ambulance control when needed. Sometimes they are paged to help out in the hospital when there are insufficient midwives available. Track 2. Maternal-Fetal Medicine : Maternal-fetal medicine is a broad topic and is professional in gynecology and No. of Research institutes working on the Maternal-fetal medicine approximately 33 or more then that as well as some university are also who gave training for to women to be Maternal-fetal medicine , total number of university are approximately 150 working on Maternal-fetal medicine and also funding are $30000- $50000 and 20% industry, Academia 30% and Others 50% are include at this topic. Maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) is the branch of obstetrics that focuses on the medical and surgical management of high-risk pregnancies. Management includes monitoring and treatment including comprehensive ultrasound, chorionic villus sampling, genetic amniocentesis, and fetal surgery or treatment. Obstetricians who practice maternal-fetal medicine are also known as primatologists. This is a subspecialty to obstetrics and gynecology mainly used for patients with high-risk pregnancies. Obstetric medicine is a closely related specialty that emphasizes the care of medical problems in pregnancy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disease of the myocardium (the muscle of the heart) in which a portion of the myocardium is hypertrophied (thickened) without any obvious cause, creating functional impairment of the cardiac muscle. It is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.The occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death in any age group and as a cause of disabling cardiac symptoms. Younger people are likely to have a more severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Maternal fetal medicine practice &amp; procedures requires practice in obstetric ultrasound, invasive prenatal diagnosis using amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, and the management of high-risk pregnancies. Some of them are further trained in the field of fetal diagnosis and prenatal therapy where they become competent in advanced procedures such as targeted fetal assessment using ultrasound and Doppler, fetal blood sampling and transfusion, ceroscopy, and open fetal surgery. Fetal and maternal factors associated with neonatal adiposity as measured by air displacement plethysmography. There is evidence that the fetal and early postnatal environments play a role in determining the risk of lifetime obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Neonatal body composition, as a surrogate marker of the in-utero environment,can be reliably and accurately measured by air displacement plethysmography (ADP). Signalling, status and inequities in maternal healthcare explain and address these differentials have focused predominantly on increasing awareness, geographic and financial accessibility. However, in a context where 70% of healthcare is private sector provided, it becomes pertinent to consider the value associated with this good. Maternal healthcare use across socioeconomic groups within a rural community, and the meanings and values attached to this behaviour, to provide new insight into the causes of persistent inequity. Abortion is the ending of pregnancy by the removal or forcing out from the womb of a fetus or embryo before it is able to survive on its own. An abortion can occur spontaneously, in which case it is often called a miscarriage. It can also be purposely caused in which case it is known as an induced abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy. The similar procedure after the fetus may be able to survive on its own is medically known as a late termination of pregnancy. Maternal and neonatal complications have increased for deliveries that occur at early- vs late-term gestation. The reasons for the increase in the rate of elective early-term deliveries are unclear but likely involve both patient and physician factors. Various strategies have been used to increase awareness of the morbidities associated with the practice of elective early-term delivery and to reduce its frequency. Insurers and quality accrediting agencies are increasingly holding hospitals accountable for their rates of elective early-term deliveries, and this pressure will likely continue to lead to widespread change in the practice of obstetrics. The interventions to increase adherence to evidence-based medicine guidelines that are described within this review may also be applicable to other areas of medicine. Maternal nutritional status is one of the most important factors of fetal growth and development. Consequently, the currently increasing prevalence of underweight women worldwide has come in the focus of interest of perinatal medicine. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of low pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) on fetal growth. Fetal blood testing is a technique used in obstetrics during labor to confirm whether fetal oxygenation is sufficient. The procedure can be performed by creating a shallow cut by a transvaginally inserted blood lancet, followed by applying a thin pipe to the site that samples blood by capillary action. Two constituents that are commonly tested by this method are pH and lactate, both being indicators of acid base homeostasis. A low pH and high level of lactate indicate that there is acidosis, which in turn is associated with hypoxia. Track 3. Urogynecology : Uro gynecology is a broad topic and is professional in gynecology and No. of Research institutes working on the Uro gynecology approximately 30 or more then that as well as some university are also who gave training for to women to be Uro gynecology , total number of university are approximately 70 working on Uro gynecology and also funding are $10000- $30000 and 10% industry, Academia 30% and Others 60% are include at this topic it is a surgical sub-specialty of urology and gynecology. Urogynecology is also known as - The subspecialty of Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery. Urogynecology involves the diagnosis and treatment of urinary incontinence and female pelvic floor disorders. Robotic-assisted surgery has evolved over the past two decades with constantly improving technology, assisting surgeons in multiple subspecialty disciplines. Robotic-assisted surgeries are gaining popularity in urologic surgery due to the possibility of manipulation through the natural orifices. Gynecological malignancies consist Endometrial, Ovarian, and Cervical Cancer and covers on the detection, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of ovarian cancer. Specific areas of interest include clinical research and mechanistic approaches, drug sensitivity and resistance, gene and antisense therapy, pathology, markers, and prognostic indicators, chemoprevention strategies, multimodality therapy, and integration of various approaches. three common gynecologic malignancies encountered in the operating arena: endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancer. Endometrial cancer is the most common of the gynecologic malignancies. Approximately 2% to 3% of women in the United States will develop cancer of the endometrium at some point during their lives. With an estimated 37,000 new cases last year, it is the fourth most common malignancy among women. It predominantly affects older women, with 75% of cases occurring in the postmenopausal years. laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation is an effective minimally invasive treatment option for distal ureteral strictures. This minimally invasive technique allows for treatment of long strictures of the distal ureter, without the need for complex reconstructive maneuvers. ureteral reimplantation is a successful and well-tolerated procedure with a proven track record in the surgical management of vesicoureteric reflux, the laparoscopic approach offers another option which improves on the open procedure with better cosmesis and convalescence, while providing a durable and successful procedure compared to injection therapy. Complications in endoscopic surgery is not known. However, knowledge of the possible complications and the reasons for these complications helps to adopt a careful approach when performing endoscopic procedures. The major areas of concerns during endoscopic procedures: anesthetic related complications, complications arising from insufflated gases, access related injuries, injuries and complications resulting from improper use of endoscopic instruments, bleeding complications, visceral injuries, port-site complications and thermal injuries. A section on injuries and complications that may also arise due to improper positioning of the patient on the operating table has also been included. laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery can be used for salpingostomy or salpingectomy to treat tubal ectopic pregnancy. ESS could be used to treat benign and malignant adnexal disease, and for hysterectomy. For adnexal disease, LESS can be used to remove ovarian cysts, salpingo-oophorectomy, to remove endometriosis, and remove malignant masses. Single-port access subtotal hysterectomy is more commonly used now, with various advancements in place to overcome the limited free movement and technical difficulty. Robotic LESS has been used in gynecology for bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and total hysterectomy. The shift from open surgery to operative laparoscopy brought on one of the greatest transformations in the history of surgery. Advancements in surgical instruments, optics, and ports have allowed the development of single port laparoscopy, or laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS). Ureteral Injury in Laparoscopic Gynecologic Surgery is indirectly or in other words of medical known as a laparoscopy to gynecologic surgery. It has allowed for both innovative advancements and new challenges in the field. As the complexity of laparoscopically approached gynecologic cases continues to increase, it is imperative for surgeons to be aware of the risk of ureteral injury. Although rare, ureteral complications with gynecologic surgery may be quite morbid; therefore, knowledge about their prevention, diagnosis, and management is of the utmost importance. Ureteral injury occurs in 0.5% to 1.5% of traditional open gynecological surgery. The true incidence of ureteral injury in laparoscopic surgery is unknown at this time, although it is believed to be higher than that of traditional surgery. Ureteral injuries have the best prognosis when they are recognized and repaired intraoperatively. A delay in diagnosis can lead to progressive deterioration of renal function. As many as 25% of unrecognized ureteral injuries result in eventual loss of the affected kidney. Inferior imaging of the urologic patient by IVP leads to the acquisition of additional imaging studies to render a diagnosis. IVP has a limited clinical role, and thus, its use should be strictly limited to highly select cases. Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a syndrome characterized by urinary urgency and frequency, usually with pelvic pain and nocturia, in the absence of bacterial infection or any other identifiable pathology. Overactive bladder (OAB) and interstitial cystitis (IC) have similar symptoms, including urinary urgency/frequency and nocturia, making them difficult to differentiate on the basis of clinical presentation alone. Both conditions may represent a clinical manifestation of a hypersensitive bladder and should be included in the differential diagnosis for patients who present with urgency/ frequency. It is especially important that IC be considered in patients with OAB that is refractory to treatment. The proposed diagnostic framework may be useful for differentiating IC from OAB and for facilitating appropriate treatment. The condition can be severely debilitating, interfering with employment, social relationships, and sexual activity. Interstitial cystitis may go undiagnosed for years, particularly in cases of mild or moderate disease. Both IC and OAB should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with symptoms of urgency and/or frequency. Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is a subtype of female urogenital fistula (UGF). It is often caused by childbirth. Vesicovaginal fistulae are typically repaired either transvaginally or laparoscopically, although patients who have had multiple transvaginal procedures sometimes attempt a final repair through a large abdominal incision, or laparotomy. Vaginal Agenesis is refered to or is a condition in which the vagina is abnormally closed or absent. The main causes of vagina is abnormally closed or absent are Complete vaginal hypoplasia or A vaginal obstruction. In women with vaginal agenesis progressive perineal dilation provides a minimally invasive method to create a functional vagina without the attendant risks or complications of traditional surgical options. Track 4. Gynecological Endocrinology : The Number of Research institutes working on the Gynecological Endocrinology : 25 approximately and Number of Universities working on this topic are approximately 80 and funding towards t h research are approximately given by University or research institute approximately $20000 - $30000 and 30% industry, Academia 20% and Others 50% are also include on this topic . Gynecological Endocrinology refers to the treatment of disorders related to fertility, menstruation and menopause. Reproductive endocrinology Fetal-Placental neuroendocrine development refers to type of a subspecialty that focuses on the biological causes and interventional treatment of infertility and its development. Pediatric and adolescent gynecology refers to a medical specialty that manages medical conditions affecting babies, children and young people. Pediatric gynecology to the medical care about women before child birth and adolescent gynecology to same as but the different is adolescent refers to care about women after the birth as well as care about child. Neuroendocrinology is the study of the interaction between the nervous system as well as same time about the endocrine system, including the biological features of the cells involved, and how they communicate. The neuroendocrine system is the mechanism by which the hypothalamus maintains homeostasis, regulating reproduction, metabolism, eating and drinking behavior, energy utilization, osmolality, and blood pressure. We can also define neuroendocrinology, like - branch of biological science devoted to the interactions between the two major integrative organ systems of animals-the endocrine and nervous systems. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can be an effective treatment for the typical menopause-related symptoms. Other long-term health problems associated with the menopause: the risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke all increase after the menopause. HRT may also have an influence on these health problems. For women with premature (age &lt;40 years) or early (&lt;45 years) menopause, current guidelines recommend HRT until the age of 51 years for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms and bone preservation. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) given as unopposed estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) gained widespread popularity in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. Pregnancy refers to or also known as gravidity or gestation is the time during which one or more offspring develops inside a woman. Pregnancy is typically divided into three trimesters. The first trimester is from week one through twelve and includes conception. Conception is followed by the fertilized egg traveling down the fallopian tube and attaching to the inside of the uterus, where it begins to form the fetus and placenta. The first trimester carries the highest risk of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus).The second trimester is from week 13 through 28. Around the middle of the second trimester, movement of the fetus may be felt. At 28 weeks, more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided high-quality medical care. The third trimester is from 29 weeks through 40 weeks. Prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes. Diabetes commonly referred to as Diabetes mellitus (DM). Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough insulin or the cells of the body not responding properly to the insulin produced. Health care providers now know that the key to a healthy pregnancy for a woman with diabetes is keeping blood glucose (sugar) in the target range—both before she is pregnant and during her pregnancy. Track 5. Gynecological Oncology: Gynecological oncology consist in Gynecology , the number of Research institutes working on the Gynecological oncology : 150 approximately and number of Universities : 200 consisting the department of Oncology and funding towards the research on this topic approximately goes $70000 - $80000 , Target audience as well as industry as well as academia consist : 40% industry, Academia 30% and Others 30%. Gynecologic oncology is a specialized field of medicine that focuses on cancers of the female reproductive system, including ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, vaginal cancer, cervical cancer, and vulvar cancer. In the United States, 82,000 women are diagnosed with gynecologic cancer annually. In 2013, an estimated 91,730 were diagnosed. Radiation therapy is an essential component in Gynecology in the primary nonsurgical management and the adjuvant postoperative treatment of selected malignancies arising in the female reproductive tract. Gynecologic cancers were among the first malignancies treated with ionizing radiation, more than a century ago. Radiation therapy using as a treating cancers of the uterine corpus, uterine cervix, vulva, and vagina. Anaesthesia for gynaecological oncology surgery must anticipate prolonged procedures that have the potential for significant blood loss and postoperative pain. Preoperative assessment must also take into account systemic disease effects, particularly for ovarian cancer, as well as the consequences of prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Palliative care of the patient with gynecologic cancer requires attention to many diverse issues and the services of many different specialists. Patients with advanced gynecologic malignancies have a multitude of symptoms; pain, nausea, and vomiting, constipation, anorexia, diarrhea, dyspnea, as well as symptoms resulting from intestinal obstruction, hypercalcemia, ascites, and/or ureteral obstruction. Palliative and supportive care services provide excellent care to patients near the end of life. During the last six months of life, the majority of gynecologic oncology patients receive anticancer therapy, While the majority of patients are referred for palliative care, it appears that most patients spend less than 30 days on hospice. Exoneration refers to an ultraradical surgical procedure consisting of an en bloc resection of the female reproductive organs, lower urinary tract, and a portion of the rectosigmoid. Exenteration also refers to removal of the uterus, tubes, ovaries, parametrium, bladder, rectum or rectal segment, vagina, urethra, and a portion of the levator muscles. In an anterior exenteration, the rectum is spared, while in a posterior exenteration, the bladder and urethra are preserved. A perineal phase, resecting the anus, urethra, and portions of the vulva, may also be required. Fibroid is a term used for two different types of tumors: Fibroids is the common term for uterine fibroids; leiomyoma or myoma originating in the uterus, A fibroid tumor is another name for a fibroma, a tumor of fibrous connective tissue. Cervical is an adjective of or pertaining to the female cervix. Ovary is an ovum-producing reproductive organ, often found in pairs as part of the vertebrate female reproductive system. Ovaries in female individuals are analogous to testes in male individuals, in that they are both gonads and endocrine glands. Although ovaries occur in a wide variety of animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate, this article is primarily about ovaries in humans. The breast is the upper ventral region of the torso of a primate, in left and right sides, containing the mammary gland which a female can secrete milk, used to feed infants, Both men and women develop breasts from the same embryological tissues.

Genitourinary medicine includes aspects of andrology, gynecology and urology. It is primarily related to medicine dealing with sexually transmitted diseases. Molecular imaging (MI) entails the visualization, characterization, and measurement of biologic processes at the molecular and cellular levels in humans and other living systems.Current perspectives in the use of molecular imaging to target surgical treatments for genitourinary cancers. Genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics offer a range of services, including: testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV testing, including rapid tests that give results in about 30 minutes and counseling for people who are HIV positive, hepatitis B vaccination, help for people who have been sexually assaulted and other clinics offer. Trauma is the leading cause of death in children, Cystography and urethrography are necessary to diagnose bladder and ureteral injuries. Genital injuries sometimes are produced by sexual abuse, and the clinician must be alert to this possibility. Maternal genitourinary (GU) infections, particularly bacterial vaginosis (BV) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are common but inadequately quantified in low-middle income countries. Preterm birth and infections account for majority (60%) of the estimated 4 million annual global neonatal deaths. About half of preterm births and the majority of early onset neonatal sepsis are attributed to maternal GU infections. Track 7.

Reproductive medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with prevention, diagnosis and management of reproductive problems; goals include improving or maintaining reproductive health and allowing people to have children at a time of their choosing. It is founded on knowledge of reproductive anatomy, physiology, and endocrinology, and incorporates relevant aspects of molecular biology, biochemistry and pathology. Regenerative medicine deals with the process of replacing, engineering or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function. A biomarker can be used for early diagnosis of a disease, identification of individuals for disease prevention, as a potential drug target, or as a potential marker for a drug response. A biomarker in reproduction could be used to improve assessment of exposure, identify subgroups susceptible to treatment, predict outcome, and/or differentiate subgroups with potentially different etiologies of disease. Reproductive cloning involves creating an animal that is genetically identical to a donor animal through somatic cell nuclear transfer. the newly created embryo is placed back into the uterine environment where it can implant and develop refers to Reproductive cloning. The role of hysteroscopy in patients undergoing IVF seems to be vital for patients in whom an IVF is being contemplated, for treatment of infertility. Diagnostic hysteroscopy should be performed before ART in all patients, including women with normal TVS and/or HSG findings, because a significant percentage of them have undiagnosed uterine disease that may impair the success of fertility treatment. Track 8. Prenatal Diagnosis : Prenatal Diagnosis consist in Gynecology , the number of Research institutes working on the Prenatal Diagnosis: 20-30 approximately and number of Universities : 80 consisting the department of Gynecology and funding towards the research on this topic approximately goes $10000 - $20000 , Target audience as well as industry as well as academia consist : 40% industry, Academia 20% and Others 40%. It is testing for diseases or conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born. Diagnostic prenatal testing can be performed by invasive or non-invasive methods. The aim is to detect birth defects such as neural tube defects, Down syndrome, chromosome abnormalities, genetic disorders and other conditions, such as spina bifida, cleft palate, Tay Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, Muscular dystrophy, and fragile X syndrome. Non-invasive techniques include examinations of the woman's womb through ultrasonography and maternal serum screens. Track 9.

Advance methods of family planning include birth control, assisted reproductive technology and family planning programs. Good-quality post-MRFP increases contraceptive use, at least in the short term. Birth control, also known as contraception. Trcak 10. Menopause : consist in Gynecology , the number of Research institutes working on the Family Planning: 40-50 approximately and number of Universities : 2 50 consisting the department of Gynecology and funding towards the research on this topic approximately goes $30000 - $50000 , Target audience as well as industry as well as academia consist : 20% industry, Academia 40% and Others 40%. Menopause, also known as the climacteric, is the time in most women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and she is no longer able to have children. Pelvic floor dysfunction refers to a wide range of issues that occur when muscles of the pelvic floor are weak, tight, or there is an impairment of the sacroiliac joint, lower back, coccyx, or hip joints. Tissues surrounding the pelvic organs may have increased or decreased sensitivity or irritation resulting in pelvic pain. Many times, the underlying cause of pelvic pain is difficult to determine. Age at menopause is 51 but most women reach menopause between the ages of 45 and 55. Premature menopause means the woman’s ovaries have spontaneously stopped working before she has reached the age of 40 years. Women can be affected in their teens or early 20s: About one in 1,000 women may reach menopause before the age of 30. Track11. Infertility: Infertility may describe a woman who is unable to conceive as well as being unable to carry a pregnancy to full term. Infertility is the inability of a person, animal or plant to reproduce by natural means. It is usually not the natural state of a healthy adult organism, except notably among certain eusocial species (mostly haplodiploid insects). The use of infertility services is not random. Understanding the sociodemographic factors correlated with use may assist new couples with family planning. Roughly 50% of the women evaluated for infertility progressed to treatment, and only a small proportion were treated with more advanced assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization. Obesity on reproductive health will concentrate on two key areas: infertility and heavy menstrual bleeding. Medical and surgical management of heavy menstrual bleeding is discussed including the many varied issues involved in hysterectomy of the obese woman. Women who are fertile experience a natural period of fertility before and during ovulation, and they are naturally infertile during the rest of the menstrual cycle. Gynecology is the medical practice dealing with the health of the female reproductive systems and the breasts. Gynecology Cancer and pre-cancerous diseases of the reproductive organs including ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, vagina and vulva. A gynaecologist is a doctor who treats medical conditions and diseases that affect women and their reproductive organs. Gynaecologists are also trained in obstetrics - the care of women during pregnancy and childbirth, which overlaps with gynecology. Obstetrics and gynaecology is the medical speciality dealing with fields of obstetrics and gynaecology through only one postgraduate training programme. This combined training prepares the practicing OB/GYN to be adept at the care of female reproductive organs’ health and at the management of obstetric complications, even though surgery. Gynecologic oncology is a subspecialty of gynaecology, dealing with gynaecology-related cancer. Obstetric -Ultrasonography is the use of medical ultrasonography in pregnancy, in which sound waves are used to create real-time visual images of the developing embryo or foetus in its mother's (womb). The procedure is a standard part of prenatal care in many countries, as it can provide a variety of information about the health of the mother, the timing and progress of the pregnancy, and the health and development of the embryo. Paediatric gynecology is also deals with the Obstetrics gynecology Gynaecologic Laparoscopy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in the United States today. Approximately half of the 700,000 bilateral tubal sterilizations performed annually in the United States are performed laparoscopically. In addition to diagnostic laparoscopy, operative endoscopy is used to perform common procedures, including removal of ectopic pregnancies, treatment of endometriosis, and lysis of pelvic adhesions. Almost one third of the 600,000 hysterectomies performed annually in the United States are now performed with the aid of a laparoscope. Although the ideal role of laparoscopy in gynecologic surgery continues to be defined, it has become a standard approach for a large number of gynecologic procedures. During pregnancy care must be taken to while consuming the gynec medicine. There are different pregnancy conferences are going to be taking place whole over the world like gynecology conferences, obstetrics and gynaecology conferences, gynecology congress. And there are different gynaecology associations like The American congress of Obstetrics and gynaecologists’, the society of Obstetrics and gynaecologists of Canada.	Conference
Squat-less routine coming from SS?	"Hi all, A few years ago when I was in college I started Starting Strength and followed it strictly for a good 6 months. I went from being 125 lbs and extremely scrawny to 150 lbs and less scrawny and more ""healthy"". I stayed on starting strength for about a year total then went to another 4 day split routine which gave me decent results. However, it was during this time that for whatever reason, my body decided to develop celiac disease. I went undiagnosed for the better part of a year and a half because I was in college a lot of that time. By the time the disease was properly diagnosed, my intestines were a mess. I was definitely not absorbing food properly and just couldn't gain any weight at all. After switching to a gluten free diet I ended up losing a lot of weight as my body adjusted and my intestines healed. I went back down to about 127 lbs. I tried returning to the gym a few times but could not get my body to cooperate. Few months down the line and I was finally feeling better. I started Starting Strength again and quickly gained my weight back and went up to 150 lbs again, and was PRing on all my lifts. However, I got a little too enthusiastic one day and ended up squatting too much. My knees must have banded in the lift and I must have torn something. I didn't think much of the pain and must have continued to lift for a good month after that. Eventually the pain became noticeable to the point that I decided to rest for a month, which I did. However, for some reason now my knee hurts more than ever. I am planning to visit my doctor soon to see what it could be (I'm thinking an injured meniscus possibly). So finally, my question is what kind of routine can I get on in the mean time? A routine that is less leg intensive. I don't want to neglect them too much and I think I could probably to leg extensions if anything. I figure in the meantime while I get my knee sorted out I should at least continue to work on my upper body. Would appreciate any help in finding a routine I can do given the above information. I'm mainly looking for strength training, but a little muscle mass wouldn't hurt either, taking into account I've been doing a lot of starting strength, where the squat is of course the cornerstone exercise. Appreciate the help! Thanks much."	Fitness
I hate my family and it makes me feel like an awful person.	I guess I have to give some background in order for this to make sense. Sorry if this is long, since this goes back 23 years..even if no one reads it, I'll feel better. My parents were never particularly good at the actual job of parenting. My father used to work long hours and my mom would stay at home, doing..something. I don't remember her being around much but dinner was always made and the shopping was always done. It feels wrong talking about this because as far as I can see it, I wasn't really 'abused' growing up. I had everything I needed and my parents were parents. My mom and dad ended up divorcing- my dad had a bad cocaine/gambling habit and ended up cheating on the side through AOL chatrooms (lol), which my mom found out somehow. He moved out and we lost our house, having to move to Gary, Indiana in a trailer park. During this time my mom really did bust her ass getting her GED and driver's license (two things my dad forbade her from having) and working like crazy to keep us fed and clothed. This is the one thing she did that I'll always respect her for. So during this time she dated a little, which didn't bother me seeing as I wasn't the biggest fan of my dad anyways. There were only a few guys over the years, but she ended up sticking with S. At first he was nice enough, and ended up moving in with us. He had been living at his parents' in Chicago after his own divorce, and they met in an AOL chatroom (double lol). As to be expected he took on a role as another parent over time. He seemed a little strict in regards to cleanliness and having things exact, which I attributed to him being ex-military. Over time things gradually became worse with him becoming verbally abusive to me and my sister, who unknown to us at the time was suffering from an undiagnosed mixture of bipolar disorder along with Asperger's (actually diagnosed Asperger's). I was able to handle his screaming and yelling (over really anything- the daily trailer cleaning not being done well, being on the computer for longer than his 45 minute time limit, not jumping immediately to do what he said), but my sister couldn't which made her a popular target for him. She progressively fell apart until being admitted to a local psych ward for a suicide attempt during which time they finally got her some help. He still treated her the same. To my mother the easier fix was getting rid of her, so instead of leaving this obviously abusive guy she got some little apartments set up through the state for her (I am entirely unclear as to how this works but it had something to do with disability i think?). This was around my teenage years. Now I was the only child left in the house with him. The verbal abuse continued, along with physical altercations. I would say something he didn't like and he'd either tackle me down to the ground and choke me, or choke me against the wall by my throat..mainly when he was drunk, which was always. Around this time I was spending more time out with friends which he regulated strictly (including attempting to block the front door with the couch if I was past the deadline, the only thing my mom ever objected to). I was depressed, felt worthless, and thought about suicide a lot. The lack of life skills they taught me led to me being pretty weird throughout school which invited a lot of bullying on top of my home life. This continued into high school and my freshman year of college. I elected to go to a small nearby school and live at home to save money, as we were still pretty broke and the aid I qualified for would be just enough to cover most of it. I figured I could stick it out. One morning I finally decided to leave. My stepdad woke up, hungover and angry as usual. There was some small argument about me taking out the garbage (I think I wanted to wait 20 minutes to take it out when I left instead of walking all the way to the dumpster right now), and he pushed me through the kitchen table. I was luckily mainly unharmed, except for a scar on my hand from the glass. He took off driving somewhere when my mom called the cops for the first time. She let him come home the next day, where he told me that if I didn't change he'd leave my mom and it'd be my fault. Luckily my girlfriend's parents took pity on my situation and let me move in with them, which I did the same day. I've been apart from them ever since, but still in communication with my mom for her sake. I hate her for letting everything that happened happen..but she's my mom. She pushes me to talk to him still, and I am on civil terms with him, but being around him just makes me angry. Even past everything that happened he's loud, obnoxious, a huge racist, and just plain gross. He got away with making me and my sister's childhood a nightmare. My actual dad has still been in touch, but he knows nothing. I would see him every other weekend and we did have some good times together, but it wasn't until I was a teenager and I felt more like somebody he was hanging out with than a son. Right after my parents divorced he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, a progressive disease that leads to being basically incapacitated eventually- my aunt that has had it longer can really only talk and move her lips. Right around then he decided to try and be nice to me, as if ignoring me my entire life until 17 didn't happen either. He ended up marrying some weird lady out in the country out east who 'takes care' of him, but it's becoming more and more obvious she can't do it and he's neglected. As the only competent child it's going to fall on my shoulders to arrange things for him one day- my dad who was never around until he needed something. I've recently graduated with my bachelor's in nursing, a field that has great flexibility for where to work. Me and my girlfriend (the same one I moved in with 4~ years ago and who has been amazing) are planning to live here a few more years and move to another state. They know this and have been guilting me. What they don't know is that I'm breaking ties with them completely and they're not going to hear from me again. As far as my sister goes, she's still in state-arranged housing. It's actually a brand new apartment in a nice area, and she gets enough money in disability or something to get by comfortably. She's pretty self sufficient. To this day my stepdad acts like everything was her fault and refuses to talk to her , including openly insulting her in front of my mom who says nothing. I have no real problems with her but I'm not too close with her, and she is very close to my mom who will just try to contact me through her. Writing this out makes me look like a horrible, whiny person. That may be true. But I can't pretend to be around and like these people forever. It shouldn't be my job to care for these people who put me through what they did, or stood by to it, people that ignored me and then took credit for my success in life (mom, dad- it's from doing the opposite of what you did). Until then I'll pretend. TL;DR: Abusive stepdad, do-nothing mom, deadbeat dad.	offmychest
When hypochondria becomes real.	"I've always been somewhat fearful for my health. Every small symptom becomes a reason to ruminate, and hours get wasted away by obsessively learning about what can go wrong in a body. I've worked myself up about blood clots I've never had, brain eating amoebas has which have never eaten my brain, and countless other diseases which have kept me awake at night. But, despite all my worrying, I've always been mostly healthy. Then Friday morning came. I woke up with the most severe pain I've ever felt in my lower right abdomen. *It's finally happening*, I thought. My appendix was exploding inside of me and that was it. I was going to die right then and there. It sure felt that way, at least. Well, the good news was it wasn't my appendix. The bad news was that it was a pretty sizeable ovarian cyst and, for the cherry on top, I've got another large cyst on my left ovary which is possibly a complex cyst as a result of possibly undiagnosed endometriosis. Not cancer... That's good. ""You'll have to come back in a month,"" my doctor said. ""To see if that other cyst is shrinking. If not, you may need surgery."" Surgery? That sounds scary. My husband was sitting in the room with me as the doctor explained everything. The cyst, the endometriosis, those things could affect my fertility. We haven't started trying yet, but we've been thinking about starting a family when I finish my degree this fall. My heart sank. My anxiety has skyrocketed this year, seemingly without explanation, but now it makes sense. These little invaders in my body are affecting my hormones, making my emotions spiral out of control and making me feel like a stranger in my own body. I normally manage my stress well but I've been having panic attacks at night time so frequently that I am afraid to sleep. Now I can't stop thinking about all of the things this new diagnosis means... Possible infertility. Increased risk of cancer. Painful surgery. Everything is so expensive... And I've already been to the doctor so many times this year. And what if they're wrong? What if it's worse than they think? Every test, every procedure. I feel like I'm in a haze and I don't know how to clear it away. What if this other cyst ruptures in my sleep, too? I am so afraid to go through the pain of another one of these things bursting. Thoughts continuously circle around in my brain, and each one feels like an itch I can't seem to scratch. They extend into the past and into the future. I struggle with wanting to have control over things which are impossible to control. It's maddening and torturous, but I don't know how to turn it off. I'm so scared. And I just want to fall asleep without being so damn anxious every night."	Anxiety
Anyone around here tried a gluten-free diet to treat lower back/leg pain?	"I'll spare you guys the details, but after seeing multiple doctors/therapists over the past year, my lower back and left side leg pain (nerve pain, to be precise), is undiagnosed. I am left self-troubleshooting at this point, unless I want to spend the rest of my life in pain and/or constantly trying different shots at pain management clinics. So I'm just curious if anyone around here has had similar symptoms that have been successfully treated with a gluten-free diet? I was curious if I maybe had celiac disease, but I've been GF for 1 day shy of 2 weeks now, and I don't feel any different at all. I do have some symptoms though, including a lactose intolerance (to cheese only, not milk/yogurt/cream/butter/etc), a small rash on my leg that's been there for ~4 years, and occasional inexplicable gastrointestinal distress. I don't think I have ""brain fog,"" and I guess I'm usually pretty tired during the week, but I go to bed at 11 and wake up at 6:50... Anyway, my plan is to continue the GF diet for a month and then go eat a donut and see what happens. If that affects me, it seems like I'd need to continue eating gluten for a while, then go get tested. Just looking for anyone with any kind of similar problem. Having a glimmer of hope would be nice. I'm only 29 years old and this pain is preventing me from doing so much. :("	glutenfree
It's been 10 years for me.	I just wanted to say a few things. I'm glad Reddit has an undiagnosed subreddit, but I wish it was stronger. More posts, more users, etc. I have been on this trainwreck of a stumbling, fumbling journey for 10 long years. My disease has left me unable to work, despite my best efforts, and my state chose not to expand Medicaid. Clinics only help with the basics, and I don't qualify for charity programs. And a doctor has to submit each case to the Undiagnosed Diseases Program, and a doctor has to request genetic sequencing. There are very few reduced-cost copay programs, and I either don't qualify for them, or I have stumped the doctors there. So I don't qualify for any kind of health insurance. I can't get a diagnosis, because I can't get help. And I can't get help, because I don't have a diagnosis. This issue has nearly left me homeless. I've already done CrowdMed, and I've already emailed talk show hosts, started a GoFundMe campaign, emailed the White House and my governor, called every clinic in my state, tried to get a lawyer, all of it. And CrowdMed was the only thing that was helpful. Unfortunately, you have to get your CrowdMed diagnostic suggestion confirmed with a physician in person. Which I can't afford. So I'm still undiagnosed. Along the way, as I have dragged my carcass through this journey, I like to at least think that I have learned what works and what doesn't. I have had journalists publish articles about me, and I have published articles about my experience as well. But it doesn't do any good. Doctors either refuse to listen or refuse to help. Right now, I am going to a local reduced-copay doctor's office. He is wiling to conduct any test I need, but this doctor's office will be paying for it all out of pocket. They can't blow the entire budget on one patient, so they are limited. I am thinking about getting some blood tests from the University of Washington's Collagen Diagnostics Lab, (skin biopsy, TAAD panel, NSG panel) having UW bill me, then apply for UW's financial assistance program. I haven't had an income since 2008, so it should be a shoe-in. My next appointment is not until September 24th, and I am stuck just biding my time until then. Such is the never-ending struggling just to find out what's killing me. I have dedicated everything I have to trying to help myself, since no one else will. I have done all my own research, called, emailed, chased new leads, and followed up, all on my own. All while everyone around me constantly chastised me, minimized my illness, and told me I was just being lazy. All while trying to avoid homelessness. Thus concludes my rant for the day.	undiagnosed
Please help us help my aunt.	My aunt is a woman in Pennsylvania who is going through much more than she should be. She's worked since she was 16. She went to college and became a nurse. She's a mother, a daughter, a wife, a friend to everyone. She's helped those who needed help most, so I'm going to help her because she needs it. She's been undiagnosed for the last two years, suffering constant seizures. They suspect it is Parkinson's, but without a second MRI, they can't figure that, or anything else, out. She got an MRI awhile back, but the doctor recommended another one so they can compare how her brain has changed within the span of time between the two. Her insurance refused her second MRI. She can only get the second MRI if she has about 2500-3000 dollars once she walks in the door. She hates asking for help, but we have no option. She's always been so hard working, she deserves all the help she can get. Her disease became so debilitating that she cannot work. Her husband will be going back to work soon, but they're trying to get this MRI as soon as possible. We appreciate any and all donations. If you can't donate, please just spread the word. Thank you! If you're able to donate, please go [here](http://www.gofundme.com/ksbe7eu4) to access the account I have set up. We really appreciate it!	Assistance
[Vent] I will always adopt, as controversial as that may be	"Adopt and foster. Throughout my childhood and now as an adult my family as fostered and adopted numerous pets. Yes, many have been sick and some have died. I have nursed sick babies, patchy furred and crusty eyed, back to health. I have had ringworm all over my body, I have had to treat my own personal cats as well. I have cried over lost litters of kittens, I have called the vet in on her day off to euthanize the last kitten left alive in a disease outbreak because I couldn't watch her die like all the others. I have scrubbed floors with bleach, eyes filled with tears, until my hands were burning. I have burned out, taken a break, and come back. I have lost a young personal adopted cat, our family favorite front and center in the yearly christmas card, to an undiagnosed heart condition. I have spent $1000 on dental work for a dog less than a month after I adopted her because her last owners surrendered her with a bleeding, painful mouth. I have wondered why my young dog was lame, and cursed whoever bred him for not doing their homework or just not caring. But I have also watched a little girl's eyes light up when she saw me in a restaurant ""Mom, that is the girl who gave us our kitten! She gave us Nala!"" and known that a kitten who started life in terrible circumstances is now the delight of a little girl because we opened our home. I have watched puppies left in dumpsters or parking lots grow up to be loved members of families. I have watched unwanted strays become therapy dogs. I have watched my own adopted pets blossom into incredible family members and they bring me joy every day. Knowing that they have second chances because we chose to adopt them, knowing that their medical and behavioral needs will always be attended to, brings me such great satisfaction. And like all of us they will die someday. It might be from a preventable medical condition that a reputable breeder would have screened for, or it might be in a freak accident, or they may live to be 16 years old and die in their sleep in their own beds. And it doesn't matter which way they die because it will always feel like it was too soon and it will always break my heart. But their lives won't end because nobody wanted them. And that is why while I appreciate good breeders who are doing their due diligence and respect anyone who chooses to purchase their pets from them I will always adopt. Adoption has brought us joy, time and time again. And even when it has brought us medical bills or death it has brought us the fulfillment of knowing we tried, we gave them the chance they deserved. Experiences may vary, I wanted to share ours."	dogs
Help finding a specialist	First off, I don't have lupus. I had some symptoms, but the ANA antigen test was negative when I had it done several years ago. Looking for advice on finding a specialist. Posting here because this is he most active autoimmune disease community I could find on reddit. I hope that's okay. I (f, 29) am almost certain that I have an undiagnosed autoimmune disease. I have struggled for years with eye problems. Severe Inflammation, Dryness, pain, blurred vision, and recurring conjunctivitis (mostly in one eye) that does not respond to steroids or antibiotics. These are made worse by exposure to dust or cosmetics but occur on their own ever few weeks regardless of lifestyle modifications. This seems minor but it is not. Inflammation has broken down the elastin in my eyelid and I've had surgery to correct that, but it was unsuccessful. My eye troubles are affecting the quality of my life every single day. I see two of the most highly recommended corneal disease specialists in the state regularly and they can't figure it out and I've tried every prescription steroid and antibiotic they can think of. They have not explored the possibility that it could be autoimmune, but a previous ophthalmologist ran tests to rule out lupus. I know my symptoms are common in RA and Sjrogen's. I have a history of widespread inflammation, particularly in my chest wall. I also have PCOS (diagnosed years ago) and a family history of Chron's disease. During my PCOS testing, doctors found a lot of inflammation in my abdomen that they were concerned about. I do not have a general physician (recently moved and haven't established myself with a doctor) but my insurance does not require a referral to see a specialist. And I'm wondering if I should see a rheumatologist or an endocrinologist because of my history of PCOS. Also looking for anyone who may have similar experience. Thanks in advance	lupus
Small Dog constant panting - tumours	Species: Dog Age: 13 Sex/Neuter status: Female neutered Breed: jack russell mixed - possibly with westie, but she looks like a Cairn Body weight: 8.7kg History: Potentially (as undiagnosed) Cushing's disease for the past year. Relatively healthy dog, but has never been walked very far (but every day). knew she had a mammary tumours when she was neutered. Clinical signs: Excessive panting; drinking all the time; seems distressed. Duration: Last few days Your general location: South-West UK Our little dog started panting the last few days and we knew there was a problem so brought her to the vet. Turns out she has a mammary tumour, which is quite big and pushing up into her abdomen. It's started to restrict her breathing. We were completely ready to put her down the other day, as the breathing was rapid and endless. However, literally as we were about to agree to this, she started to improve and her breathing calmed down a little. She seemed a lot calmed and happier and seemed brighter in the eyes. The vet agreed that it seemed we would have a bit more time with her. However, she has been drinking so much all day - I didn't realise as my mum has been letting her drink all day - and now I guess she has a full bladder and it's increased the pressure and she's started to pant on and off quite a lot. I guess she's doing it to cool herself down? Is there anything I can do to relieve her breathing a little and get her to calm down so she can sleep? I am not happy for her to go on like this as she seems distraught and can't settle. I just wonder if it's because my mum let her drink all that water. I've taken her out to pee a few times, and she had a diuretic at the vet's, although a few days ago. Obviously, I don't want her to suffer, but it seems like she had stabilised a little so she could calm down and have a little bit longer with her. What could I do?	AskVet

So I looked up some info about the Rainbow clown lady...	"Apparently she became a grief counselor after her parents and two quadriplegic sons died. Oh my gaahhhhdd. :/ I don't know how legit this info is, but if this is all true...man. &gt;Eloise was abandoned by her birth parents and adopted into a fascinating but dysfunctional family. She grew up with multiple challenges that tested her ability to survive, both physically and emotionally. &gt; In 1975, Eloise married a young widower named Elwood Cole who had four teenage children. Two of the four, Mark and Dan, had a life threatening neuromuscular disease and were quadriplegic. This new family of six pulled together and became a tight family unit. &gt; Mark, the oldest, managed to live off campus while studying at the local University when he suddenly suffered a cardiac arrest and died. While Mark was very ill, he had been considered the healthiest of the two boys and his death was not expected at that time. &gt; A few months prior to Mark's death, Eloise's father had died. Twenty days following Mark's death, Eloise's mother collapsed and died from an undiagnosed aneurysm. Around the same time, the family dog also died. &gt; From her experience of living through so many tragedies and at the same time knowing that Dan, who was particularly fragile, could die anytime, Eloise composed the poem ""Borrowed Hope"". &gt; At the time, Eloise was supporting others as a grief counselor. Her son Dan lived five more years and managed to graduate from the local University. &gt; Eloise became nationally known for her work as a Bereavement Specialist. In the summer of 2005, she was diagnosed with lung cancer and battled with strength and grace for four short months until her death in December 2005.

Read David Andrews’s Diabetes Destroyer reviews. CLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT DIABETES DESTROYER GUIDE AND DIABETES TREATMENT Diabetes is a condition caused by poor production of insulin by the pancreas. Type I diabetes continues to be undiagnosed until some symptoms become austere and hospitalization is needed. If left untreated, diabetes can cause a lot of health complications like blindness, strokes, heart disease, nerve damage and kidney failure. There is a newly launched system named “Diabetes Destroyer” which is a step by step instructional guide which renders complete solution to winnow out pre-diabetes, type I diabetes and type II diabetes. . ================================ * &gt; **[VISIT OUR OFFICIAL WEBSITE](http://w.atch.me/G1DB7)** ================================ . ================================ * &gt; **[VISIT OUR OFFICIAL WEBSITE](http://w.atch.me/G1DB7)** ================================ .

This diabetes destroyer program will render people an in-detailed explanation on how diabetes really works and it will show them a number of treatment approaches on how to activate brown fat cells so that they can keep in line their blood sugar level more potently. Diabetes Destroyer is the main treatment for type I and II diabetes as it ruptures a lot of people’s antecedently clutched notions about health, cures and medicaments.

Moreover, people should check their blood sugar level on regular basis to ensure that they get the best remedial treatment. This Diabetes Destroyer program will teach people how to pull together their metabolic rate so that they can attain a healthy weight. Find Out How To Treat Diabetes With Diabetes Destroyer The first module of the program stations around potent dietary management that may be adequate to moderate the disease. The main aim of this module is to maintain a normal blood sugar level. Module 2 hinges upon showing people efficacious ways of moderating blood sugar level aside from increasing brown adipose tissue. The third module hashes out the importance of diabetes medicaments and treating.

I am a 19M with a neurodegenerative disease AMA	In short, i have been dealing with an undiagnosed disease for over 2 years now. Right now im in rehab working on my walking and waiting for a few test results. I also get double vision and a lot of trouble swallowing, after u finish asking a question feel free to list a food i can buy or cook as its been almost 3 months since i last ate a meal. For those that are interested: This whole thing started in march 2013 with symptoms like i had the flu. I went to the hospital after have not eaten for a week and feeling weak. My nurse called the neurologist because he noticed a droop in the right side of my face. I was treated with cortisone steroid through an iv which took 1 hour to complete and had to be done for 5 days. Everytime since theni got new symptoms or old symptoms got worse.new symtoms such as my legs being really stiff and unable to bend, trouble swallowing everything including my saliva, and myoclonus which is when my whole body will jerk backwards for no reason. Every test i have had done came back as if there was nothing wrong with me, but i am waiting for a few results to come back. Now whhere I am is i am in rehab working on my abilility to walk, hopefully i wont need assistance anymore, i dont wanna continue using a walker at 19 years old. I am also going to be starting swallowing exercises next week so that hopefully soon i can eat again. Tomorrow i am starting a 5 day treatment of a med called IVIG which my doctors are very hopeful about. AMA and even list a food i need to eat again or even try.	AMA

I also had a significant tachacardiac event after engaging in sexual activity, to the point where I had thought that i was about to have a heart attack. Sometimes i think its just anxiety that would make me feel my palpitations. After 10 minutes, I began to feel better after drinking water and walking around the house. I noticed that it got worse when i laid down. I eat alot for a skinny guy and sometimes I think that my arteries are beginning to weaken/clog. I used to not get this fatigued/weakened after jogging. I would jog long distances before (earlier this year) and now I barely last 5 minutes jogging. Again, I have been feeling these symptoms within the last 1.5-2 weeks. I scheduled to see my family physician but its until September 18( at the earliest). Should I go see an Urgent Care Physician?"	AskDocs
My life was, is, and seems like it will always be shitty.	"I was born with a genetic disease that went undiagnosed because my parents took me to the pediatrician in their neighborhood (poor). My mother had(has) untreated borderline personality disorder and I more or less lived in fear until I was a teenager. Because of the genetic thing I was slowish for my age and incredibly awkward. I was always the last pick at kickball, except for when my one friend was picking. Not that it wasn't for reason, my shitty co-ordination and joint laxity allowed me to kick a ball about three feet. Between my home life and general middle school misery those years especially fucking sucked. Somehow I was identified as gifted despite being told I was stupid via my grades and classmates and wound up going to a rich high school. I captained the academic team, the swim team, was managing editor of the paper. I was still shit because all I could afford was a rusted out 15 year old corolla and k-mart jeans. My teeth were yellow (reflux because my gastric sphincter doesn't close because of my illness) and crooked to the point a girl I liked said she couldn't date me because she was afraid to kiss me. Somehow I fell in with a group of people too stoned to care, but I couldn't even afford weed because of work laws in my state. The one bright point in my life was engineering school and my ex-wife. I spent most of my waking moments in a fucking basement with other ""losers"" like me. My ex wife I met wihen I was 16. Might as well have played creep 24/7 considering how I felt about myself. I loved her greatly. I graduated, realized that everything I knew about the world was bullshit, grew to hate the rich as I worked ever closer with them. I changed jobs every six months for a 10-20k raise, in part to make more money and in part to walk out one day and leave a message on my bosses voicemail that I had taken another position and would no longer be in - because fuck them, most of them went to private colleges and had MBAs, rich parents, and much material success. Most irritatingly, they had perfect, straight, white teeth. Somehow I wound up making $110,000 as a 26 year old in flyover country by serially dicking employers over. That lasted about nine months and I developed epilepsy, and shortly after psychosis. I had a small stroke that left me with the epilepsy, and was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, slapped on heavy medication and was awarded SSDI within two months. I would have gotten 60% of my salary for 30 years, but my employer dropped LTDI a month before I was basically fired. Not that I deserved any loyalty :). My life devolved into the same shit it had been when I was younger. I accumulated so many laboratory confirmed diagnoses that my nurse practitioner sent me to a geneticist. I was diagnosed with a 1 in 50,000 condition and was lucky enough to have my own mutation so they have no idea how it will play out. I had another stroke and learned what tortuous meant after reading it in the radiologist report. I should have had bracing from a young age, I never should have done a pullup one, and I defininitely should have never run for cross training, because my joints are in bad shape. My ex-wife couldn't take it because our sex life was crap (came to find out it was endocronilogical failure - balls just stopped working) and we got divorced. I found another relationship, but that fell through too, so now while I am waiting for an apartment to open up in an accessible living situation I am living in my old room, which my dysfunctional as fuck family filled up with stuff after a cat peed in it repeatedly and just left the door closed. My life is kinda like war - I have a baseline of pain, interspersed with moments of incredible agony. An EMT friend was trying to show the tricks they use to see if people are ""faking"" to a group. She was shocked that I didn't respond to any of them. Compared to what I experience on a daily basis a sternum rub or pressing on my quick feel like absolutely nothing. I've seen so many family members become opiate addicts (I'm from poor trash basically) that I am terrified of them. I wear rigid locking braces on my knees to keep from falling when they bend so far forward it looks like a chicken leg, and I was told I need a big brace for my shoulder that constantly dislocates now that I just haven't pursued because I don't give any more fucks. So basically I'm just killing time until an uncontrollable blood pressure spike (high score is 243/168) leaves me bad enough off that my living will kicks in. Guess some people are born to sing the blues. FML. I shampooed the 30 year old carpet about 5 times and you can only barely smell the cat piss, so I have that going for me, which is nice."	bitch
Poop comes out light brown, or dark brown with light brown spots. The lighter colored poop usually floats. Am wondering if this, plus other symptoms, could be signs of a digestive disease? [17F]	"Preface: Ever since I was an infant I've had issues with constipation. My mother said it seemed to be first triggered after being sick and given a certain antibiotic at a few months old. Ended up with constant impacted stool pretty much up until middle school. Now the constipation comes and goes. So lately (around 3+ months) I've been noticing color changes in my stool. Stools are usually dark brown and clumpy (Type 2 on the Bristol stool scale) but seemingly at random will become light brown and very soft. These stools usually float and are unusually smelly. Sometimes the two stools will ""combine"" with light spots showing up on my regular stools. Just today, I was pushing out a pretty hard stool and halfway through it became very soft and exited with ease. I looked into the toilet and the first part of it looked normal (dark brown, a little clumpy) but in the middle it starkly changed into the very light colored soft stool. When wiping I noticed the light part was, as usual, very smelly. So this combined with other symptoms I've had my whole life (excessive flatulence, regular stomachaches, constipation, recurring headaches/migraines sometimes triggered by food, difficulty gaining weight, poor appetite) have led me to start thinking that I may have an undiagnosed digestive disease? I tried looking into Celiac Disease and asked my doctor about trying a gluten-free diet but was told that it was ""just a fad"" and to just go back to fiber supplements. Any advice/insight into this would be really, really appreciated."	shittingadvice

A Message to a Poor Soul; From me to Future me.	"Disclaimer: This post is NOT to encourage any use of the drugs mentioned below. On the contrary, it's there to serve as a deterrent and a reminder: To me, before all the readers. If, however, you decided to go against my suggestion (you have free will ofc.) Please do more research and not just base it on this single thread. 2nd Disclaimer: I have taken more than one psychoactive drug today, but I'm almost certain that the following words are from normal, sober me. The drugs helped me start it, but in the end it was I who wrote this whole thing. I should mention that I was diagnosed with ADHD later in my life, as well as severe Major Depression Disorder by two different psychotherapist. I am getting proper help now and I am miles better. I will get into this with more detail. ______________________________________________________ Dear Amor, I hope this message finds you in good spirits! I (present me) am writing a personal message to my future self, whom shall be referred to hereafter as Amor (Latin for Love). I hope everything is going well in your life at the moment. Intro: This post will be long and divided into sections, read what you want. Now, I'll be addressing parts of this post to future me as a reminder of the drug use rules I've set and why I set them in case I ever forget as well as to compile my small research and conclusions about Meth and Amphetamines. Today I tried meth for the first time. I am at the comedown of the trip and it's almost over. I'll use whatever motivational boost I have left to finish this (Note: Most of the good effects were gone after I wrote less than 30% of it, the rest including editing, sourcing, and reviewing was the work of ADHD me, It'll be fun to see what this mash-up will look like once I read it from the future). **Doses**: 280 lbs., 5""10', mid 20's, Male: (important because of metabolism) T0:00, 50 mg of DNM Meth plugged. Has been reagent tested. Vendor didn't mention purity, but they have very good reviews, so I bought .25 g (No sourcing requests!). I thought the dose was relatively big with a very good ROA. [Scientifically, we are not sure about the bioavalabilty of rectal administration.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672287/), but some individuals report +90% up to 98%. Take it for whatever it's, it's just forum talk. T+1:30, 1 mg of Xanax (prescribed for situational anxiety: dentists and flying). Did help focus the energy, but very very subtly+was overpowered by meth, but it did it job. T+5:00 Smoked a bowl of ABV weed. I also smoked some quality pipe tobacco through out the whole thing. Weed was used to help relax the muscle tension. Didn't feel anything more than a weak, but pleasant body load. Probably didn't affect the trip in the slightest. T+7:30 I took 4 grams total of both white and red strain kratom. Believe it or not, that was probably the best part of the trip. I decided not to use Xanax to help me sleep as I don't want to overdo it, unless it becomes necessary. I drank 8 liters of water with electrolytes throughout the whole day and I am still thirsty. I expected nothing less. I also have had 8-9 hours of sleep for at least a week. _______________________________________________________ **Trip report**: T+0:15 I am starting to feel the effects, (supposedly should've been 2-3 mins) at which point it felt like 400 mg of caffeine and 800 mg of l-theanine (insanely awesome and safe combo, read about it!). I suspected it was placebo effect at this point, but I was waiting patiently for the rush. T+0:30 it resembled 400 mg of Modafinil at this point. It's very nice and subtle. No actual rush, more like a smooth but a noticeable buildup. Still I am anticipating the best high of my life. Now, I was certain it's not placebo. T+0:45 Euphoria reached its peak. It was insanely underwhelming. Not bad or terrible, but not even in my top 10 in my short-lived drug experience. At this point, I was severely disappoint in the king of stimulants. (I will expand in the precaution section. It's important to read that section before you start arguing with me on this point) Side note: My definition for euphoria in this case. Is the tickling, warm, orgasm-like only 100 times better. My experience this time though, felt like 1/10th of an avg orgasm lasting for quite a while. T+1:00 My productivity was impressive, I'd finish 8-hour-long job in 2 hours probably, yet again it was underwhelming compared to what I've read. Still, my productivity was miles better than the euphoric effects. Motivation, was as underwhelming as the euphoria was. T+3:00 I stayed at a chatroom helping poor souls who lost their way to the path of psychedelia (having bad trips). The people over there helped me through bad trips and I am grateful to them and would love to pay back. Hopefully, most of them ended up with good trips. If not, at least a meaningful ""revelation"" out of it. T+5:00 I went to private chats and made couple of friends. I could swear I felt sleepy, I thought the xanax somehow overpowered the meth, but apparently it's one its effects, weird I know. For the past two hours tho, my productivity peaked in the middle hours. I'd write endlessly. It was the best effect of all and it might be something I could use in the future, but unfortunately it fails my standard of risk v. reward, so I see no use for it. T+7:00 I took a protein shake to stop muscle atrophy. I've had a big breakfast and a snack throughout the day (I'll eat some more before I go to bed). I ran some errands in town and my interactions were normal and no one was be able to tell. I noticed I interrupted mid-sentence a lot. It's an old habit of mine. Meth could've brought it out, but it only required a sense of diplomacy and will power. This was around the time I started writing this post. Light dysphoria starting as well. T+10:00 Most of the meth should be out of my system. I believe it stays for 10-12 for rectal ROA. I finished writing some parts of it. I still need to write more and delete the repetitive stuff, edit it most of it, and post the source. I'll make sure to shorten it, but even then It's still long. Just right now the dysphoria disappeared without me noticing it. T+13:00 Most of the lingering positive effects are gone. Only the muscle tension, confusing insomnia, and appetite suppression are present atm. Now the dysphoria came back. There's a slight lose of focus. I don't think I can carry this but trying to fall asleep is just impossible. I have no other choice. T+15:30 I didn't intend to report this far, but I've been urinating 3-4 times an hour and my body feels hot. I've been sweating profusely throughout the whole thing but it's expected. I drank a lot of water and my dose is understandably big. I don't think I can drink before bed, so to not piss my bed. I'll drink enough water in the morning. I also had some shrimp for dinner, but I could barely eat them. Dysphoric effect reach their peak. It's cool though. I've dealt with worse. Sleep should be enough. I'll redose kratom and if it doesn't work, I'll take another 0.5 mg of xanax to knock me out (there's no CNS depression risk). I have been awake for about 18 hours at most. Loss of focus and productivity is present. The only reason I am writing, is because trying to fall asleep drives me mad. T+18:30 Ok so now I am 99% done. I'll read the whole thing and see if I can make it one post, otherwise, it'll be divided in the comments. For the last 8 or so hours, I believe the effects were minimal and it was me, my willpower, and my hangover against time. I just felt that I'd postponed it long enough to say tomorrow I'll finish it. After I post it, I'll head to bed and hopefully I can fall asleep. T+20:00 Done with everything :) I've been awake for 22 hours give or take. I've done worse back in the day. I couldn't sleep before and it was very irritating just trying to fall asleep. I hope now I can get some piece of mind. Reminder: I have ADHD and I experience stimulant medications somewhat differently than other ""normal"" people. Not sure if the same applies to methamphetamine, but I don't see why it shouldn't **Effects**: Positives: Overall it's a positive experience, but barely so. The negatives were many and the risk is just dangerously high. Had it not been for the Xanax and kratom I mixed, it would've probably ended net negative. * Productivity, best effect hands down. I was writing so easily and words just come out naturally. Of course there's a shortcoming. I couldn't prioritize my goals and ended up chatting with a lot of people. I am not sure, I'd say most of the fault lays on me on this one, but I'd love to have stim experts comment on this one. * I am pleasantly surprised I could give this wall of text my full attention without being distracted a lot. This effect was subtle, but just as I wrote this, I only realized I was distracted 8 times in 4.5 hours. A new record. * No teeth grinding. * Suppressing appetite! It could help me with my weight, but who am I kidding? Using it for that purpose is only asking for trouble. Ephedrine is better for this task. I am working on my weight (lost 60 lbs. since early Feb). I believe that diet and hardwork alone are the only way to guarantee I never set myself back like with other methods (drugs, operations etc.) * Euphoria was there but it was very subtle. In a way, I am glad I didn't experience its true potential. Deep down inside, I didn't want to fall in love with. This way, it'll make never trying it again easier. **Negatives**: * Obviously there's a risk of neurotoxicity. I supplemented accordingly, before and after hoping I can minimize the risk. Supplements will be mentioned in the science section. These precautions only help to a certain extent. * There was a severe pain in the bottom half of my body, legs and testicles especially. I usually get this kind of pain from fevers. I suspect it's high blood pressure (runs in the family :( ) I didn't even bother to google it. I know it's only temporary and good kratom eases the worst of hangovers/crashdowns. * My focus is worse than it was before I dosed. I expect the hangover to not last more than a day. * Unfortunately, I wasn't able to guide my productivity. I mean this is great and all but it's unnecessarily long. I have a ton of stuff to pack, since I am moving but I didn't even bother with it.[I know it's a joke, but I kinda wished my high was like this](https://gfycat.com/DimpledDeficientCopperbutterfly) * An extended dysphoria during the comedown. The dysphoria was greater than the euphoria and both lasted about the same time. Meditation and then kratom took care of it. * Tobacco is a mild, short acting MAOI. This is the reason it synergize so well with dopamine releasing drugs. Substances like most stims, opiates and psychedelics, and alcohol are great at this synergy. However, the smoke was meh. I've had better luck with alcohol and a cig (and I hate both). I don't smoke all that often and only use it in combos where appropriate, which is around 2 cigs a week give or take. * I experienced an anxiety attack. Nothing severe, I could've managed to ride it out, but I wanted to make it a better experience and took the 1 mg of Xanax. A decision I don't regret. * I pissed about 3-4 times an hour, and no matter how much I drink. I can't quench my thirst. I've stopped at 8 L (2 gallons), and will drink water first thing in the morning. * I was sweating profusely every hour or so. * Weirdly, I felt both sleepy after 5 hours of dosing, but it was impossible to sleep. A weird side effect for a stimulant. * This is not really big of a deal, but I read reports of music enhancement. Didn't feel any and was kinda bummed because it was supposed to be a big part of my trip. Then again it's not reported that often. * I was surprised I didn't feel aroused at all. Seriously though, I didn't feel the need to masturbate. It's probably for the best I didn't force myself to do it. I like it when it comes naturally. That way it's more meaningful. I am pretty sure if I started it I wouldn't have stopped--Good! ^^ I realize that most of these effects could've been dampened if I dosed therapeutically, but that wasn't what I wanted out of this. I got the worst of both worlds I think :) ______________________________________________ **Science behind it**: (disclaimer! I am not a doctor or a pharmacologist. I have a very solid understanding in chemistry but it wasn't of much use for me here. I'd love to have the great brains of this sub to correct me) [Amphetamines, or stimulant medications in general are known to improve cognitive-abilities such as focus and motivation. However, only properly diagnosed patient (I don't like the term, but oh well) have had reports of increased IQ on tests. Normal people will have the focus and motivation but nothing other than that.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489818/) It should be noted that nothing yet is completely conclusive and that Desoxyn (brand name for Meth) wasn't mentioned in the study. [I have ADHD and there are studies that claim that we get different effects from stimulant, compared to neurotypical individuals. I was prescribed 30 mg Adderall XR and absolutely hated it. I never felt normal so I hastily asked my Dr. to stop the rx. (I can't bring myself to sell it. I have an ethical dilemma with that).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489818/) Meth is not neurotoxic at all doses in short durations. However, long exposure at low doses can destroy dopamine receptors causing Parkinson Syndrome. Neurotoxicity has been proposed to involve oxidative stress due to overexcitability from both the release of dopamine and inhibition of its reuptake. Higher doses can destroy Serotonin receptors. It varies of course with the doses and ROA, the two safest ROA are believed to be smoking and IV'ing. The reasoning behind this is that their half life is significantly shorter making it easier for the body to get rid of it before any damage takes place. Rats have a half life of 1 hour for IV meth, making them practically immune to its neurotoxicity&lt;&lt; this is all theoretical as far as I understand. Of course, IV and smoking poses other dangers, such as higher risk of dependance because of the subjectively better effects and the increased likelyness of redosing ( Significantly increase the risk of neurotoxicity) There are a few studies on its neuroprotective properties. However, It's only neuroprotective in rare cases. Say someone was hit on the head and went into a concussion, Desoxyn could help in the short turn. Thus, this info is irrelevant to recreational users. I dearly, apologize for not being able to provide sources for this one. I am a terrible note taker. If I find them I'll post them shortly. [Damage to DA and 5-HT receptors has been persistent for 4 years in primates, leading researches to believe that it's permanent. However, there have been findings that could prove its reversibility in humans. Scans from frequent methamphetamine users and people with Parkinson disease showed different screenings that made us one step closer to the truth, nothing conclusive AFAIK.](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/18/1/419.full.pdf) To my surprise, as addictive as meth is, it's not physically addictive. However, psychological dependance is just as serious if not even worse in some cases. It's up there with the most addictive, nonetheless. [These are the proper doses to minimize risk. They're from Bluelight (a highly suggested read.:](http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/426392-Meth-neurotoxicity-avoidable-with-infrequant-use) &lt;&lt;Supplements could be found in that link. Therapeutic use: Days 1-7: 0.15mg/kg Days 8-?: &lt;0.5mg/kg for males, &lt;0.25mg/kg for females No more than once a day. Recreational use: Days 1-7:0.15mg/kg Days 8-?: &lt;1.0mg/kg for males, &lt;0.5mg/kg for females No more than once every 3-4 days. Notice the difference between male and females dosing. The theory behind it, is that females lack certain androgenes found only in men. It's neuroprotective to a certain degree against meth and amphetamines. _____________________________________________ **Words of caution**: * All of meth, xanax, kratom, tobacco, and to an extent weed are habit forming. Some obviously are more dangerous than others. You'll experience physical and psychological WDs effects varying in severity. Please read extensively before deciding to try any of them. I highly suggest lurking the addiction subs. They are a great source of motivation and info * I don't mean to sound assertive, but please don't suggest other ROA, potentiators, etc. to guarantee a better experience. I know I have no right to dictate what you can or can't say, it's just that I didn't get the most of my experience, and I feel like it should stay that way. I don't want to open a door I can't close. * I usually find myself inclined to weigh personal anecdote heavily and the advice of a drug expert (drug addicts/users), because whether we admit it or not we are an outcast group and barely enough proper research has been done on most of our drugs. If there's any, it's geared more towards therapeutic research. Not to say these are mysteries to us, we just need to open the door for research of recreational use before even thinking about decriminalization or legalization, because it's truly the thing we need the most. Although, research would become easier if full legalization were to occur. Here are 2 classic stories that I've felt like sharing: * This is another story that I read many, many times: You will probably start out your meth habit with a use schedule. You say once a month or a year etc.. Couple of months later you buy bulk and use discounts as an excuse. Then before you know it, you have a problem. This is a classic story that I've read many many times. I know some of you might be out of their minds because I am being a hypocrite. Allow me please to explain myself in my next paragraph. I decided to never use it again. I am writing this letter/report in case I ever become weak in the future. Now, I have solid, logical argument as to why I think this is a bad idea with a high risk and low reward. I genuinely think that my underwhelming experience will help me tremendously combat any unexpected future temptation. This part was supposed to be personal but it fitted here better. * Not even once. Is a classic propaganda line. D.A.R.E and the likes always say it even on the safest of drugs. I am afraid for meth it might actually be true. This is just me reporting what I read from horror stories on the internet and most of the people who've lived it, warn curious druggitors to not even try it once, more than I've seen for Heroin and Coke. I personally think that there's no substance on this earth that could cause an addiction, WDs, or actual cravings from a single use, but I can't pretend to be stupid. Their message is very clear and most appreciated. _______________________________________________________ **Promises to self**: No big 3 rule: obviously, I condone those who follow this rule, and to an extent I followed it. Now I won't write a trip report on Coke because it's not worth it. Short duration, expensive, underwhelming effects. Reddit knows the circlejerk so I'm not gonna bother with or waste my money again. I am sure it has its times and uses. Imagine you are a rock star about to start a very big performance. It's the perfect time to be megalomaniac. Xanax or couple of beers might help you loosen up, but coke will make you run to stage to show the world you're the best out there. Short answer, this is literally the opposite of what I want from most recreational drugs. Heroin, however I could never bring myself to try it. I wholeheartedly love opiates. I remember one night I was extremely depressed, and was a push away from suicide. I looked at the medicine cabinet and found an opiate, probably Morphine Sulfate (tablets). I think they were 20 mg each and I snorted a few over the course of few hours. I can't recall the numbers correctly, but what I'll never forget is that it literally took me with a swift hand and took all of my problems away. Just couple of minutes ago I was thinking of ending it, and now no matter how hard I try to have bad thoughts I just can't. I had the most mixed feelings at the moment. On the one hand, I was warm and fuzzy and blissfully euphoric, on the other hand the sane part of my mind is trying to comprehend how anything could be this powerful. I kept screaming it's not fair, it's not fair, nothing that strong could be without consequences. Back then I didn't know a whole lot about drugs. I knew Morphine was an anesthetic that's highly addictive and feels good. It was a cousin of mine who tried it and told me how great it is. This is my only experience with a strong opiate. Intellectually speaking, I realize that Heroin isn't a whole lot different than prescribed opioids (purity aside). They pretty much carry the same risk of addiction given similar potencies, albeit Heroin is somewhat harder to kick for its subjectively better effects. It's just a stigma that I can't see changing anytime soon. I know myself better than anyone out there. I know that once I find the one thing that can take away any grief, I'll be living in hell for the rest of my life if I go down that route. Not to say that if I use it once I'll become addicted, but rather that I am more susceptible most to this class of drugs. Based on that, I shall never abuse an opiate prescription and only take it as prescribed, and if the Dr. doesn't understand the addiction potential, I'll lower my dose to what I believe is safe through objective research. The only exception will be Kratom. It's a very weak opioid. That doesn't mean it can't have WDs, but I deemed it safe if done on weekends only. And now into meth. Subjectively speaking, the experience was a disappointment on pretty much all levels. I am sure IV'ing is better but I also don't need to go down that route. I think this is self-explanatory. The report up top explains in details why it's a bad idea to ever use it again. Ok so now my poor soul has satisfied its desires. I tried 2 of the big 3 and explored that scary world. I think in a way, this experience will help me not fantasies about them like before. I promise to visit this message everytime I consider trying any of the 3 again. I used to tell myself I'll try the big 3 once I am in my late 70's. I don't think it's a bad idea, but I'd like to add to conditions. I shall never use them between now and then, and I'll be chipping them. Hopefully by then it'll all be legalized at least. Otherwise, I'll steer clear. Funnily enough though, I am not entirely sure legalizing these 3 drugs is the safest thing, but I am not here to start a debate. **Now into general guidelines for other drugs**: * You don't like alcohol, its taste, its effects, pretty much everything about it. Don't let peer pressure dictates what you do. Yeah a glass of champagne or sweet red wine once every blue moon won't hurt. It'll work as a reminder of why you hate it. * Benzos barely affect you. You don't have a GAD, only a few anxiety attacks once every 1-2 months. Keep a few for just in case situations. Bad trips, tweaking, insomnia. You already use it sparingly and would love if you continue to do so. * Psychedelics are a great way for me to review my life from in the purest way possible. Use them once a month and change between them. You know that high doses never work for you and as the oldest rule in the book goes: More is not always better. All in all, this is one of the safer classes you shouldn't worry too much about them. * Dissos (your favorite) are sort of high risk/unknown territory. You've done ample research and I believe your schedule is good as is. In case you forgot here it is: DXM wait is a week per plat, and you opt for a month minimum. Higher plats (4/5/stigma) are once a year, twice max if you like it, but remember our favorite has always been high-2nd on XR form. * Weed (your 2nd favorite) is also low risk. However, you are susceptible to phantom pain and anxiety attacks at lower doses. Remember the sweet spot? Where it's extremely easy to control your dose without consuming much? It's usually comes from a month's use 3-4 times a week. Stick to weekends mostly, but it's ok to unwind after a long day. Again you hate high tolerance because it takes more to smoke and it hurts your wallet and lungs. This one is easy, but I wrote it just in case. * Kratom is on the basis of as needed, not to exceed 3 times a week. Mix it with weed, that combo is the best. * Tobacco: This is a tricky one. You already are experiencing light cravings, but no major WDs if you stop. This is the perfect time to stop. Remember that it was only to be used in combos where it's appropriate. Not to vent out your frustration. Heck 8/10 times you don't enjoy it on its own. Oh, and if you were to smoke stick to the quality pipe tobacco. If you are doing something harmful at least enjoy it. * Amphetamines, you may not have liked your prescription ( it was both less negative than the meth trip and less positive). While pharmaceutical Amphetamines are way safer than street meth, they still posses risks of their own, that are easily, but not entirely supplemented. Go and discuss with your Dr. non-stim ADHD medication. Discuss having a smaller, XR that might ease it a bit. Just don't let it bite you from the back and make you dropout one more time. I don't believe there are a lot of other drugs interesting to us to explore. If there was, do your normal research procedure. You love reading as is, even if you don't end up trying it. _______________________________________________________ **Now starts the personal message**: **Personal anecdote**: I've been through a lot lately. What's worse though, is that I can't share any of it with others be it psychiatrists, family, or friends. No one will understand the whole story, which is better kept a secret between the two of us ;) Your undiagnosed depression has made your life hell for the past few years. Remember the terrible days of self-harm and self-loathing? You dropped out of a full-ride at an Ivy school and burned all the bridges. You lost every bit of hope and that was the most dangerous of it all. Never let it happen again. As is I barely have a lot of memories from that terrible era in my life. I won't write any details hoping I can forget it one day. I know it's a major cliche, but things indeed will become better. I should know it as I feel I fixed most of my problems just through CBT. The rest is in your hand, Amor. Go to a professional and seek help once you finish moving and settle. Recovery rates for the depressed are insanely high, not so much for the ADHD folk, but you can only try your hardest. **Confession and a cry for help**: I'd like to be the first to say that I see how my drug use could very well and very soon turn into a problem. For that, I've decided to move to another country for at least half a year. It's self-exploration of some sort, but more importantly, it'll be simply impossible to source drugs. Be it DNM or otherwise. That's as specific as I can be. Good thing only Amor knows where this place is. It'll be 6 months of full abstinence (well maybe a sip of coffee here and there). Hopefully Amor should seek professional help so we can get out of that place fresh again. Now enough with the saddening talk. I know you don't like it. Why don't you pick up your old hobbies? Here I'll help you remember them: **Things to do in your life**: Now into the things you used to be passionate about, Amor. Remember the days where you'd stay 4 hours in the kitchen to make a meal from master chef finales? You used to love it and spend most of your time perfecting your techniques. You were one helluva cook. You won 1st prize twice at a local BBQ and International cuisine contest (They were both small and the prize was a dinner for two at a fancy restaurant in town). You were the best cook hands down in your last family meeting. I know cooking as well as you do. You may drop out of form, but you never forget the essence. Go ahead and cook dinner for yourself. Your roomie has scorched enough meat and now it's your time to shine again. What about that game of yours you started developing? I'll be honest and say you gave up before you even started for real. At least go finish the 3 small games you started. Heck I know you're lazy don't even bother publishing them. I almost forgot. You wanted to play guitar right? You realize that Tame Impala isn't going to be played magically on the guitar that's collecting dust. Buy strings and give it a shot. 20 hours of practice is all I ask. You have a semester off. Get an easy job. After all this is your time to relax and unwind from all the things that happened last couple of years. Just go for the highest bidder, dude. You are extremely lazy and I love you just that way. Never change. I mean know where to concentrate your energy. I am pretty sure you know what to do at this point. Yes you'll have a semester off, but then you'll have to go back to school to complete your undergraduate studies. You know better than anyone that without hardships, anyone could prevail. This is vital to you. You should know from personal experience that without a college degree, you can't get anywhere reputable in life. At least this is the case for our country, Amor. Get your life together! And know one thing Amor, is that I'll love you unconditionally no matter what. Yours truly, Literally You This is my first time doing this kind of message, now it's such a mess and I couldn't fix it, but I like it that way :). I wasn't sure where to post it, but I know that /r/confessions will go apeshit on me. /r/stims seemed like the perfect place so I'll x-post it. I might take the science part to /r/drugnerds but I don't think it lives up to their standards."	Drugs
A Message to a Poor Soul; From me to Future me.	"Disclaimer: This post is NOT to encourage any use of the drugs mentioned below. On the contrary, it's there to serve as a deterrent and a reminder: To me, before all the readers. If, however, you decided to go against my suggestion (you have free will ofc.) Please do more research and not just base it on this single thread. 2nd Disclaimer: I have taken more than one psychoactive drug today, but I'm almost certain that the following words are from normal, sober me. The drugs helped me start it, but in the end it was I who wrote this whole thing. I should mention that I was diagnosed with ADHD later in my life, as well as severe Major Depression Disorder by two different psychotherapist. I am getting proper help now and I am miles better. I will get into this with more detail. ______________________________________________________ Dear Amor, I hope this message finds you in good spirits! I (present me) am writing a personal message to my future self, whom shall be referred to hereafter as Amor (Latin for Love). I hope everything is going well in your life at the moment. Intro: This post will be long and divided into sections, read what you want. Now, I'll be addressing parts of this post to future me as a reminder of the drug use rules I've set and why I set them in case I ever forget as well as to compile my small research and conclusions about Meth and Amphetamines. Today I tried meth for the first time. I am at the comedown of the trip and it's almost over. I'll use whatever motivational boost I have left to finish this (Note: Most of the good effects were gone after I wrote less than 30% of it, the rest including editing, sourcing, and reviewing was the work of ADHD me, It'll be fun to see what this mash-up will look like once I read it from the future). **Doses**: 280 lbs., 5""10', mid 20's, Male: (important because of metabolism) T0:00, 50 mg of DNM Meth plugged. Has been reagent tested. Vendor didn't mention purity, but they have very good reviews, so I bought .25 g (No sourcing requests!). I thought the dose was relatively big with a very good ROA. [Scientifically, we are not sure about the bioavalabilty of rectal administration.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672287/), but some individuals report +90% up to 98%. Take it for whatever it's, it's just forum talk. T+1:30, 1 mg of Xanax (prescribed for situational anxiety: dentists and flying). Did help focus the energy, but very very subtly+was overpowered by meth, but it did it job. T+5:00 Smoked a bowl of ABV weed. I also smoked some quality pipe tobacco through out the whole thing. Weed was used to help relax the muscle tension. Didn't feel anything more than a weak, but pleasant body load. Probably didn't affect the trip in the slightest. T+7:30 I took 4 grams total of both white and red strain kratom. Believe it or not, that was probably the best part of the trip. I decided not to use Xanax to help me sleep as I don't want to overdo it, unless it becomes necessary. I drank 8 liters of water with electrolytes throughout the whole day and I am still thirsty. I expected nothing less. I also have had 8-9 hours of sleep for at least a week. _______________________________________________________ **Trip report**: T+0:15 I am starting to feel the effects, (supposedly should've been 2-3 mins) at which point it felt like 400 mg of caffeine and 800 mg of l-theanine (insanely awesome and safe combo, read about it!). I suspected it was placebo effect at this point, but I was waiting patiently for the rush. T+0:30 it resembled 400 mg of Modafinil at this point. It's very nice and subtle. No actual rush, more like a smooth but a noticeable buildup. Still I am anticipating the best high of my life. Now, I was certain it's not placebo. T+0:45 Euphoria reached its peak. It was insanely underwhelming. Not bad or terrible, but not even in my top 10 in my short-lived drug experience. At this point, I was severely disappoint in the king of stimulants. (I will expand in the precaution section. It's important to read that section before you start arguing with me on this point) Side note: My definition for euphoria in this case. Is the tickling, warm, orgasm-like only 100 times better. My experience this time though, felt like 1/10th of an avg orgasm lasting for quite a while. T+1:00 My productivity was impressive, I'd finish 8-hour-long job in 2 hours probably, yet again it was underwhelming compared to what I've read. Still, my productivity was miles better than the euphoric effects. Motivation, was as underwhelming as the euphoria was. T+3:00 I stayed at a chatroom helping poor souls who lost their way to the path of psychedelia (having bad trips). The people over there helped me through bad trips and I am grateful to them and would love to pay back. Hopefully, most of them ended up with good trips. If not, at least a meaningful ""revelation"" out of it. T+5:00 I went to private chats and made couple of friends. I could swear I felt sleepy, I thought the xanax somehow overpowered the meth, but apparently it's one its effects, weird I know. For the past two hours tho, my productivity peaked in the middle hours. I'd write endlessly. It was the best effect of all and it might be something I could use in the future, but unfortunately it fails my standard of risk v. reward, so I see no use for it. T+7:00 I took a protein shake to stop muscle atrophy. I've had a big breakfast and a snack throughout the day (I'll eat some more before I go to bed). I ran some errands in town and my interactions were normal and no one was be able to tell. I noticed I interrupted mid-sentence a lot. It's an old habit of mine. Meth could've brought it out, but it only required a sense of diplomacy and will power. This was around the time I started writing this post. Light dysphoria starting as well. T+10:00 Most of the meth should be out of my system. I believe it stays for 10-12 for rectal ROA. I finished writing some parts of it. I still need to write more and delete the repetitive stuff, edit it most of it, and post the source. I'll make sure to shorten it, but even then It's still long. Just right now the dysphoria disappeared without me noticing it. T+13:00 Most of the lingering positive effects are gone. Only the muscle tension, confusing insomnia, and appetite suppression are present atm. Now the dysphoria came back. There's a slight lose of focus. I don't think I can carry this but trying to fall asleep is just impossible. I have no other choice. T+15:30 I didn't intend to report this far, but I've been urinating 3-4 times an hour and my body feels hot. I've been sweating profusely throughout the whole thing but it's expected. I drank a lot of water and my dose is understandably big. I don't think I can drink before bed, so to not piss my bed. I'll drink enough water in the morning. I also had some shrimp for dinner, but I could barely eat them. Dysphoric effect reach their peak. It's cool though. I've dealt with worse. Sleep should be enough. I'll redose kratom and if it doesn't work, I'll take another 0.5 mg of xanax to knock me out (there's no CNS depression risk). I have been awake for about 18 hours at most. Loss of focus and productivity is present. The only reason I am writing, is because trying to fall asleep drives me mad. T+18:30 Ok so now I am 99% done. I'll read the whole thing and see if I can make it one post, otherwise, it'll be divided in the comments. For the last 8 or so hours, I believe the effects were minimal and it was me, my willpower, and my hangover against time. I just felt that I'd postponed it long enough to say tomorrow I'll finish it. After I post it, I'll head to bed and hopefully I can fall asleep. T+20:00 Done with everything :) I've been awake for 22 hours give or take. I've done worse back in the day. I couldn't sleep before and it was very irritating just trying to fall asleep. I hope now I can get some piece of mind. Reminder: I have ADHD and I experience stimulant medications somewhat differently than other ""normal"" people. Not sure if the same applies to methamphetamine, but I don't see why it shouldn't **Effects**: Positives: Overall it's a positive experience, but barely so. The negatives were many and the risk is just dangerously high. Had it not been for the Xanax and kratom I mixed, it would've probably ended net negative. * Productivity, best effect hands down. I was writing so easily and words just come out naturally. Of course there's a shortcoming. I couldn't prioritize my goals and ended up chatting with a lot of people. I am not sure, I'd say most of the fault lays on me on this one, but I'd love to have stim experts comment on this one. * I am pleasantly surprised I could give this wall of text my full attention without being distracted a lot. This effect was subtle, but just as I wrote this, I only realized I was distracted 8 times in 4.5 hours. A new record. * No teeth grinding. * Suppressing appetite! It could help me with my weight, but who am I kidding? Using it for that purpose is only asking for trouble. Ephedrine is better for this task. I am working on my weight (lost 60 lbs. since early Feb). I believe that diet and hardwork alone are the only way to guarantee I never set myself back like with other methods (drugs, operations etc.) * Euphoria was there but it was very subtle. In a way, I am glad I didn't experience its true potential. Deep down inside, I didn't want to fall in love with. This way, it'll make never trying it again easier. **Negatives**: * Obviously there's a risk of neurotoxicity. I supplemented accordingly, before and after hoping I can minimize the risk. Supplements will be mentioned in the science section. These precautions only help to a certain extent. * There was a severe pain in the bottom half of my body, legs and testicles especially. I usually get this kind of pain from fevers. I suspect it's high blood pressure (runs in the family :( ) I didn't even bother to google it. I know it's only temporary and good kratom eases the worst of hangovers/crashdowns. * My focus is worse than it was before I dosed. I expect the hangover to not last more than a day. * Unfortunately, I wasn't able to guide my productivity. I mean this is great and all but it's unnecessarily long. I have a ton of stuff to pack, since I am moving but I didn't even bother with it.[I know it's a joke, but I kinda wished my high was like this](https://gfycat.com/DimpledDeficientCopperbutterfly) * An extended dysphoria during the comedown. The dysphoria was greater than the euphoria and both lasted about the same time. Meditation and then kratom took care of it. * Tobacco is a mild, short acting MAOI. This is the reason it synergize so well with dopamine releasing drugs. Substances like most stims, opiates and psychedelics, and alcohol are great at this synergy. However, the smoke was meh. I've had better luck with alcohol and a cig (and I hate both). I don't smoke all that often and only use it in combos where appropriate, which is around 2 cigs a week give or take. * I experienced an anxiety attack. Nothing severe, I could've managed to ride it out, but I wanted to make it a better experience and took the 1 mg of Xanax. A decision I don't regret. * I pissed about 3-4 times an hour, and no matter how much I drink. I can't quench my thirst. I've stopped at 8 L (2 gallons), and will drink water first thing in the morning. * I was sweating profusely every hour or so. * Weirdly, I felt both sleepy after 5 hours of dosing, but it was impossible to sleep. A weird side effect for a stimulant. * This is not really big of a deal, but I read reports of music enhancement. Didn't feel any and was kinda bummed because it was supposed to be a big part of my trip. Then again it's not reported that often. * I was surprised I didn't feel aroused at all. Seriously though, I didn't feel the need to masturbate. It's probably for the best I didn't force myself to do it. I like it when it comes naturally. That way it's more meaningful. I am pretty sure if I started it I wouldn't have stopped--Good! ^^ I realize that most of these effects could've been dampened if I dosed therapeutically, but that wasn't what I wanted out of this. I got the worst of both worlds I think :) ______________________________________________ **Science behind it**: (disclaimer! I am not a doctor or a pharmacologist. I have a very solid understanding in chemistry but it wasn't of much use for me here. I'd love to have the great brains of this sub to correct me) [Amphetamines, or stimulant medications in general are known to improve cognitive-abilities such as focus and motivation. However, only properly diagnosed patient (I don't like the term, but oh well) have had reports of increased IQ on tests. Normal people will have the focus and motivation but nothing other than that.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489818/) It should be noted that nothing yet is completely conclusive and that Desoxyn (brand name for Meth) wasn't mentioned in the study. [I have ADHD and there are studies that claim that we get different effects from stimulant, compared to neurotypical individuals. I was prescribed 30 mg Adderall XR and absolutely hated it. I never felt normal so I hastily asked my Dr. to stop the rx. (I can't bring myself to sell it. I have an ethical dilemma with that).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489818/) Meth is not neurotoxic at all doses in short durations. However, long exposure at low doses can destroy dopamine receptors causing Parkinson Syndrome. Neurotoxicity has been proposed to involve oxidative stress due to overexcitability from both the release of dopamine and inhibition of its reuptake. Higher doses can destroy Serotonin receptors. It varies of course with the doses and ROA, the two safest ROA are believed to be smoking and IV'ing. The reasoning behind this is that their half life is significantly shorter making it easier for the body to get rid of it before any damage takes place. Rats have a half life of 1 hour for IV meth, making them practically immune to its neurotoxicity&lt;&lt; this is all theoretical as far as I understand. Of course, IV and smoking poses other dangers, such as higher risk of dependance because of the subjectively better effects and the increased likelyness of redosing ( Significantly increase the risk of neurotoxicity) There are a few studies on its neuroprotective properties. However, It's only neuroprotective in rare cases. Say someone was hit on the head and went into a concussion, Desoxyn could help in the short turn. Thus, this info is irrelevant to recreational users. I dearly, apologize for not being able to provide sources for this one. I am a terrible note taker. If I find them I'll post them shortly. [Damage to DA and 5-HT receptors has been persistent for 4 years in primates, leading researches to believe that it's permanent. However, there have been findings that could prove its reversibility in humans. Scans from frequent methamphetamine users and people with Parkinson disease showed different screenings that made us one step closer to the truth, nothing conclusive AFAIK.](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/18/1/419.full.pdf) To my surprise, as addictive as meth is, it's not physically addictive. However, psychological dependance is just as serious if not even worse in some cases. It's up there with the most addictive, nonetheless. [These are the proper doses to minimize risk. They're from Bluelight (a highly suggested read.:](http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/426392-Meth-neurotoxicity-avoidable-with-infrequant-use) &lt;&lt;Supplements could be found in that link. Therapeutic use: Days 1-7: 0.15mg/kg Days 8-?: &lt;0.5mg/kg for males, &lt;0.25mg/kg for females No more than once a day. Recreational use: Days 1-7:0.15mg/kg Days 8-?: &lt;1.0mg/kg for males, &lt;0.5mg/kg for females No more than once every 3-4 days. Notice the difference between male and females dosing. The theory behind it, is that females lack certain androgenes found only in men. It's neuroprotective to a certain degree against meth and amphetamines. _____________________________________________ **Words of caution**: * All of meth, xanax, kratom, tobacco, and to an extent weed are habit forming. Some obviously are more dangerous than others. You'll experience physical and psychological WDs effects varying in severity. Please read extensively before deciding to try any of them. I highly suggest lurking the addiction subs. They are a great source of motivation and info * I don't mean to sound assertive, but please don't suggest other ROA, potentiators, etc. to guarantee a better experience. I know I have no right to dictate what you can or can't say, it's just that I didn't get the most of my experience, and I feel like it should stay that way. I don't want to open a door I can't close. * I usually find myself inclined to weigh personal anecdote heavily and the advice of a drug expert (drug addicts/users), because whether we admit it or not we are an outcast group and barely enough proper research has been done on most of our drugs. If there's any, it's geared more towards therapeutic research. Not to say these are mysteries to us, we just need to open the door for research of recreational use before even thinking about decriminalization or legalization, because it's truly the thing we need the most. Although, research would become easier if full legalization were to occur. Here are 2 classic stories that I've felt like sharing: * This is another story that I read many, many times: You will probably start out your meth habit with a use schedule. You say once a month or a year etc.. Couple of months later you buy bulk and use discounts as an excuse. Then before you know it, you have a problem. This is a classic story that I've read many many times. I know some of you might be out of their minds because I am being a hypocrite. Allow me please to explain myself in my next paragraph. I decided to never use it again. I am writing this letter/report in case I ever become weak in the future. Now, I have solid, logical argument as to why I think this is a bad idea with a high risk and low reward. I genuinely think that my underwhelming experience will help me tremendously combat any unexpected future temptation. This part was supposed to be personal but it fitted here better. * Not even once. Is a classic propaganda line. D.A.R.E and the likes always say it even on the safest of drugs. I am afraid for meth it might actually be true. This is just me reporting what I read from horror stories on the internet and most of the people who've lived it, warn curious druggitors to not even try it once, more than I've seen for Heroin and Coke. I personally think that there's no substance on this earth that could cause an addiction, WDs, or actual cravings from a single use, but I can't pretend to be stupid. Their message is very clear and most appreciated. _______________________________________________________ **Promises to self**: No big 3 rule: obviously, I condone those who follow this rule, and to an extent I followed it. Now I won't write a trip report on Coke because it's not worth it. Short duration, expensive, underwhelming effects. Reddit knows the circlejerk so I'm not gonna bother with or waste my money again. I am sure it has its times and uses. Imagine you are a rock star about to start a very big performance. It's the perfect time to be megalomaniac. Xanax or couple of beers might help you loosen up, but coke will make you run to stage to show the world you're the best out there. Short answer, this is literally the opposite of what I want from most recreational drugs. Heroin, however I could never bring myself to try it. I wholeheartedly love opiates. I remember one night I was extremely depressed, and was a push away from suicide. I looked at the medicine cabinet and found an opiate, probably Morphine Sulfate (tablets). I think they were 20 mg each and I snorted a few over the course of few hours. I can't recall the numbers correctly, but what I'll never forget is that it literally took me with a swift hand and took all of my problems away. Just couple of minutes ago I was thinking of ending it, and now no matter how hard I try to have bad thoughts I just can't. I had the most mixed feelings at the moment. On the one hand, I was warm and fuzzy and blissfully euphoric, on the other hand the sane part of my mind is trying to comprehend how anything could be this powerful. I kept screaming it's not fair, it's not fair, nothing that strong could be without consequences. Back then I didn't know a whole lot about drugs. I knew Morphine was an anesthetic that's highly addictive and feels good. It was a cousin of mine who tried it and told me how great it is. This is my only experience with a strong opiate. Intellectually speaking, I realize that Heroin isn't a whole lot different than prescribed opioids (purity aside). They pretty much carry the same risk of addiction given similar potencies, albeit Heroin is somewhat harder to kick for its subjectively better effects. It's just a stigma that I can't see changing anytime soon. I know myself better than anyone out there. I know that once I find the one thing that can take away any grief, I'll be living in hell for the rest of my life if I go down that route. Not to say that if I use it once I'll become addicted, but rather that I am more susceptible most to this class of drugs. Based on that, I shall never abuse an opiate prescription and only take it as prescribed, and if the Dr. doesn't understand the addiction potential, I'll lower my dose to what I believe is safe through objective research. The only exception will be Kratom. It's a very weak opioid. That doesn't mean it can't have WDs, but I deemed it safe if done on weekends only. And now into meth. Subjectively speaking, the experience was a disappointment on pretty much all levels. I am sure IV'ing is better but I also don't need to go down that route. I think this is self-explanatory. The report up top explains in details why it's a bad idea to ever use it again. Ok so now my poor soul has satisfied its desires. I tried 2 of the big 3 and explored that scary world. I think in a way, this experience will help me not fantasies about them like before. I promise to visit this message everytime I consider trying any of the 3 again. I used to tell myself I'll try the big 3 once I am in my late 70's. I don't think it's a bad idea, but I'd like to add to conditions. I shall never use them between now and then, and I'll be chipping them. Hopefully by then it'll all be legalized at least. Otherwise, I'll steer clear. Funnily enough though, I am not entirely sure legalizing these 3 drugs is the safest thing, but I am not here to start a debate. **Now into general guidelines for other drugs**: * You don't like alcohol, its taste, its effects, pretty much everything about it. Don't let peer pressure dictates what you do. Yeah a glass of champagne or sweet red wine once every blue moon won't hurt. It'll work as a reminder of why you hate it. * Benzos barely affect you. You don't have a GAD, only a few anxiety attacks once every 1-2 months. Keep a few for just in case situations. Bad trips, tweaking, insomnia. You already use it sparingly and would love if you continue to do so. * Psychedelics are a great way for me to review my life from in the purest way possible. Use them once a month and change between them. You know that high doses never work for you and as the oldest rule in the book goes: More is not always better. All in all, this is one of the safer classes you shouldn't worry too much about them. * Dissos (your favorite) are sort of high risk/unknown territory. You've done ample research and I believe your schedule is good as is. In case you forgot here it is: DXM wait is a week per plat, and you opt for a month minimum. Higher plats (4/5/stigma) are once a year, twice max if you like it, but remember our favorite has always been high-2nd on XR form. * Weed (your 2nd favorite) is also low risk. However, you are susceptible to phantom pain and anxiety attacks at lower doses. Remember the sweet spot? Where it's extremely easy to control your dose without consuming much? It's usually comes from a month's use 3-4 times a week. Stick to weekends mostly, but it's ok to unwind after a long day. Again you hate high tolerance because it takes more to smoke and it hurts your wallet and lungs. This one is easy, but I wrote it just in case. * Kratom is on the basis of as needed, not to exceed 3 times a week. Mix it with weed, that combo is the best. * Tobacco: This is a tricky one. You already are experiencing light cravings, but no major WDs if you stop. This is the perfect time to stop. Remember that it was only to be used in combos where it's appropriate. Not to vent out your frustration. Heck 8/10 times you don't enjoy it on its own. Oh, and if you were to smoke stick to the quality pipe tobacco. If you are doing something harmful at least enjoy it. * Amphetamines, you may not have liked your prescription ( it was both less negative than the meth trip and less positive). While pharmaceutical Amphetamines are way safer than street meth, they still posses risks of their own, that are easily, but not entirely supplemented. Go and discuss with your Dr. non-stim ADHD medication. Discuss having a smaller, XR that might ease it a bit. Just don't let it bite you from the back and make you dropout one more time. I don't believe there are a lot of other drugs interesting to us to explore. If there was, do your normal research procedure. You love reading as is, even if you don't end up trying it. _______________________________________________________ **Now starts the personal message**: **Personal anecdote**: I've been through a lot lately. What's worse though, is that I can't share any of it with others be it psychiatrists, family, or friends. No one will understand the whole story, which is better kept a secret between the two of us ;) Your undiagnosed depression has made your life hell for the past few years. Remember the terrible days of self-harm and self-loathing? You dropped out of a full-ride at an Ivy school and burned all the bridges. You lost every bit of hope and that was the most dangerous of it all. Never let it happen again. As is I barely have a lot of memories from that terrible era in my life. I won't write any details hoping I can forget it one day. I know it's a major cliche, but things indeed will become better. I should know it as I feel I fixed most of my problems just through CBT. The rest is in your hand, Amor. Go to a professional and seek help once you finish moving and settle. Recovery rates for the depressed are insanely high, not so much for the ADHD folk, but you can only try your hardest. **Confession and a cry for help**: I'd like to be the first to say that I see how my drug use could very well and very soon turn into a problem. For that, I've decided to move to another country for at least half a year. It's self-exploration of some sort, but more importantly, it'll be simply impossible to source drugs. Be it DNM or otherwise. That's as specific as I can be. Good thing only Amor knows where this place is. It'll be 6 months of full abstinence (well maybe a sip of coffee here and there). Hopefully Amor should seek professional help so we can get out of that place fresh again. Now enough with the saddening talk. I know you don't like it. Why don't you pick up your old hobbies? Here I'll help you remember them: **Things to do in your life**: Now into the things you used to be passionate about, Amor. Remember the days where you'd stay 4 hours in the kitchen to make a meal from master chef finales? You used to love it and spend most of your time perfecting your techniques. You were one helluva cook. You won 1st prize twice at a local BBQ and International cuisine contest (They were both small and the prize was a dinner for two at a fancy restaurant in town). You were the best cook hands down in your last family meeting. I know cooking as well as you do. You may drop out of form, but you never forget the essence. Go ahead and cook dinner for yourself. Your roomie has scorched enough meat and now it's your time to shine again. What about that game of yours you started developing? I'll be honest and say you gave up before you even started for real. At least go finish the 3 small games you started. Heck I know you're lazy don't even bother publishing them. I almost forgot. You wanted to play guitar right? You realize that Tame Impala isn't going to be played magically on the guitar that's collecting dust. Buy strings and give it a shot. 20 hours of practice is all I ask. You have a semester off. Get an easy job. After all this is your time to relax and unwind from all the things that happened last couple of years. Just go for the highest bidder, dude. You are extremely lazy and I love you just that way. Never change. I mean know where to concentrate your energy. I am pretty sure you know what to do at this point. Yes you'll have a semester off, but then you'll have to go back to school to complete your undergraduate studies. You know better than anyone that without hardships, anyone could prevail. This is vital to you. You should know from personal experience that without a college degree, you can't get anywhere reputable in life. At least this is the case for our country, Amor. Get your life together! And know one thing Amor, is that I'll love you unconditionally no matter what. Yours truly, Literally You This is my first time doing this kind of message, now it's such a mess and I couldn't fix it, but I like it that way :). I am x-posting this from /r/drugs. This is probably the perfect sub for this."	Stims
I think I may have an undiagnosed autoimmune disease	[deleted]	autoimmunity
I am a physician with profound interest in IBS. Ask me anything.	"So basically I am a physician and work in a Gastroenterology clinic. Everyday I see patients with IBS who go undiagnosed and enter the clinic for extensive (often unnecessary) tests. IBS sufferers share with me their frustrations - how they are ignored by most of other physicians because no ""organic"" disease is present. Over the years I developed a keen interest in IBS and other functional GI disorders. Not surprisingly this topic is underappreciated and even ignored by many physicians. Recently I created a website where I offer online medical consulting for IBS via Skype video call and even WhatsApp and Viber - http://ibscall.com But this is another story. So basically I am here to help and share my expertise. Ask me anything. ------------------------------------------------------- IMPORTANT!!!! The AMA will end on 28 September.

On Pearl's Character, and her Relationship with Rose Quartz	"- [Link to my last post about me having autism, and identifying with Pearl and the other Gems](https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/3mjh4a/as_someone_with_autism_i_want_to_thank_rebecca/) ------------ **tl;dnr Warning** ------------------------ If you thought my last post was a feels trip, you'd better buckle up, because it's gonna be another bumpy ride. After my last post (see linked above), I did more thinking about the Crystal Gems - and in particular, their relationship with Rose Quartz. It's fairly obvious that Pearl was in love with Rose (or, at least she was in love with the *idea* of Rose Quartz/love); Amethyst seems to have loved Rose like a mother; and Garnet cared for Rose as well, as Rose was implied to have accepted Garnet for her true nature, as a fusion and a relationship. Now, I know there has been a *lot* of discussion on /r/stevenuniverse, particularly concerning the exact nature of Pearl's relationship with Rose. Given that, from my last post, I made it clear that I identify with Pearl the most, I wanted to share some insight on my part as to *why* Pearl feels - and acts - the way she does, concerning Rose. You see, fellow SU fans, in my last post, I mentioned relating to the Crystal Gems' experiences ""because I lived them"". In the case of Pearl and the Crystal Gems' relationship with Rose, and dealing with her subsequent choice and loss, I, too, unfortunately experienced something in my life along those lines. I also think that it can explain a *lot*, so bear with me, here. (Keep in mind, I'm not making any of this up to fish for karma. My story is based on a real-life tragedy, with the names changed. If anyone is interested in the real articles, feel free to PM me. The following is also c/ped from my original post on /r/askreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3f1p5u/why_are_you_an_atheist/ctkh3hd).) When I was 14, back in 2005-2006, I was part of an international, UK-based equestrian group called Pony Club, or USPC for the American branch. Our own local Pony Club was disbanding, so my mom decided that we would join the Pony Club of a town about an hour away. The leader of the new Pony Club was an older woman in her 50's, reasonably healthy, save for a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. She, in turn, had a 12-year-old daughter, in addition to a younger son, and several grown children she'd previously adopted and raised. She also adopted (or rescued) off-the-track Thoroughbred racehorses who might otherwise be put down, retaining them to be hunter/jumper and trail horses. A devout Catholic, she had spent much of her life being faithful, and sought to be as giving as possible, hence why she'd adopted so many children. Much like Rose Quartz, she also absolutely loved and adored animal and human misfits alike. She truly cared about them, and took in as many as she could. She was, in a sense, a mother to many. According to my mom, she had also slim to no chance of having her own children, until she managed to conceive her biological daughter 12 years prior, and later on, her youngest son. My family being devout Catholics as well, my mom hit it right off with her, and both decided to send their daughter to a summer equestrian boarding camp up to the north of the state. When I met her 12-year-old daughter, who I'll call Lacey, she seemed very nice, if bookish and shy. She was thin, blonde, with short-cropped hair and glasses. I didn't know it at the time, but I had undiagnosed autism, and I'd always had a hard time making friends. I'd always known I was ""different"", called a ""weirdo"" and a ""freak"" by other children at school. However, this girl was nice and sweet, and we shared similar interests, and I finally felt like I was able to make a good friend. While at camp, we bunked together with her best friend, also from her club. I was looking to get into photography, so I had her pose for a few pictures for me. After camp was over, we didn't see each other for several months due to the start of school, but my mom planned for me to go to Club events with this girl. Come March of the following year, I had just gotten home from school, and went to work on my homework. I noticed my mom was on the phone, but while normally she's a chatterbox, she was very quiet. After hanging up the phone, she turns to me, very slowly, and says, ""You remember your friend Lacey? She's dead."" She had just been on the phone with Lacey's sobbing mother. She then proceeds to tell me that, a few days after Lacey's 13th birthday, the Club was holding a fun riding event with a bunch of kids. Lacey's mother was helping oversee it. It was muddy out, but no one thought much of it. One of the younger, smaller children was having trouble with one of the rescued horses, so she asked Lacey to ride the horse to ""work it out"". As soon as Lacey got on the horse, the horse reared, and slipped in the mud. It fell on Lacey, crushing most of her body and head. Even despite Lacey wearing a helmet, the sheer blunt force of it was too much. ...The area was rural, so they had to wait for Lacey to be airlifted to the hospital. By the time they managed to stabilize Lacey in the hospital, the doctor(s) pronounced her brain dead. The family decided to remove Lacey from life support, and let her die. When my mom told me the news, I just was in shock and disbelief. Almost numb. I felt like it was some sort of joke, that it wasn't really true. All my life, I had been believed that God was an all-benevolent being, one who protected children and loved them. I had also believed in the Virgin Mary, the protective ""mother of us all"". Why, then, had he let Lacey, who was so sweet and so full of life, die so horrifically? Or the Virgin Mary, for that matter? Wasn't she supposed to *protect* her? Why would God inflict so much pain and suffering on her poor mother, who had sacrificed so much to help others? When all she wanted as a child, a daughter, of her own? How could God be so cruel as to punish a woman who had been so loyal and devout, so *faithful?* (To top it off, the poor woman began to have some psychological problems after her daughter's death. It broke her.) Then, that turned to thoughts of, how could God have done this to *me?* I, too, had been loyal, devout...*faithful*. Even despite everything that I'd been through, everything I'd suffered, I wore my faith like a badge of honor. As early as fourth grade, I had already read through all books on saints. I'd picked out my future Confirmation name - Agnes - with pride, choosing it for the saint's ""purity"" and loyalty to God. You know what the ironic part was? St. Agnes was a Roman girl who was only *13 years old* when she suffered martyrdom for her Faith. Agnes had made a promise - a promise to God never to stain her purity. To always remain loyal, and serve God. It is said that her exact words were, ""I am already promised to the Lord of the Universe. He is more splendid than the sun and the stars, and He has said He will never leave me!"" The reason why I am mentioning all of this, is because, in a similar - if not identical - manner, this is how I see Pearl's emotions towards Rose Quartz. In SU, it's implied that Pearl, more than any of the other Crystal Gems, seems to have suffered from Rose Quartz's passing the most. However, *why* is this? Let's take a closer look at some of the quotes by/about Pearl in SU thus far. Two were also in my past post, linked above. &gt; ""But it's true! No matter how hard I try to be strong like you...**I'm just a Pearl...I'm useless on my own**...I need someone to tell me what to do...When we fuse, I can feel what it's like to be you...! Confident and secure and complete...You're perfect...You're the perfect relationship...You're always together...I just—I wanted to be a part of that..."" &gt; ""But this is all that's left of her army? Some **lost, defective Pearl**, a puny overcooked runt, and *this* shameless display?"" &gt; ""But we won! Your mother led us to glorious victory! The odds were against us, and our hearts were uncertain. But we chose to fight alongside Rose, and here we made our stand against our Gem Homeworld! ...She was courageous, and brilliant... and beautiful...Sometimes, you look so much like her."" &gt; ""Shh! It's a secret, even to Garnet and Amethyst. Rose had a place that she kept hidden from all but me, but you have her gem. That place is yours now, and I can show it to you! ...**I was your mother's sole confidant— for the words she could share with no one else, I was there to listen**...She had to, Steven! It's the mark of a great leader, knowing just what to keep hidden from everyone you're trying to protect. Everyone, except me!"" &gt; ""No, Rose didn't have a lion, because, if she had a lion I would have known about it! ...But not from me, I was the one she told everything! **You can't understand how I feel, none of you had what we had!** What do you know?! You've never even met her!"" &gt; ""Sometimes, you even sound like her...do you remember this place? Do you have *any* of her memories? We were right here, over 5,000 years ago...Everything I ever did, I did for her. **And now, she's gone. But I'm still here.** Sometimes, I wonder if she can see me through your eyes...What would she think of me now?"" From here on, I'm going to piggyback a bit off of becausegoodbye's post on Tumblr. &gt; In the finale, Jasper sneeringly calls Pearl “a defective pearl.” A defective pearl, implying one of many. &gt; That made me suspect that there are more Pearls back on homeworld, perhaps an entire class of them. More than that, though, because of the slur-like way Jasper spat out the word “pearl”, it made me suspect that homeworld’s society is likely structured hierarchically by gemstone-caste. &gt; Given how neatly the metaphor works, I think it’s probably pretty likely that the hierarchy is determined at least partially by the various gems’ relative scarcity. There is probably only one Yellow Diamond, which may explain (or perhaps partially constitute) their authority. &gt; In contrast, pearls are a relatively common and plentiful type of gem here on earth – valued more for their uniformity than their size or colour or quality – so I wouldn’t be surprised if they were a correspondingly common, ‘lower’, and largely undifferentiated class of Gem on homeworld. I have a strong feeling we’re going to meet more pearls before the series is out, and I wouldn’t be at all surprised if they are treated as an underclass of servants or, at best, bureaucrats. &gt; What I’m really interested in, though, is what this means for Pearl the character. &gt; We saw in her flashback in “An Indirect Kiss” how she treated Rose with deference, bowing to her as though she were royalty (which she probably was). She and Rose did clearly have a special relationship; Pearl brags about being Rose’s “closest confidant”, and declares that “none of you had what we had”. In her holographic flashback, we saw Rose call her “my pearl.” &gt; ...Pearl clearly treasured this relationship with Rose beyond anything. She stayed to fight for Rose. She abandoned her people and history to defend a planet (which she honestly doesn’t seem to care for very much) for Rose. &gt; And now that Rose is gone, all she has is Steven...Steven, and the desperate desire that he *become* her reason for staying, that he can somehow make all of this worth it for her, that she can once again be seen – and so again be able to see herself – through Rose’s eyes. &gt; If having this relationship with Rose really was the first truly individuating factor in Pearl’s life – the first thing that made her feel like she could be more than “a pearl”, made to serve whatever purpose she was created for – it’s completely understandable why she was so distraught upon finding out that Rose had kept things from her. (It’s not like that needs further explanation; it’s pretty clear why that would be hurtful and challenging regardless, but I think it deepens the picture.) Any erosion of Pearl’s relationship with Rose is an erosion of her belief in herself as an individual worthy of attention and love. &gt; It made a huge impression on me when Pearl said to Steven, “Sometimes I wonder if she can see me through your eyes.” She mentions that in the context of worrying about what Rose might think of her now, but I also think that it expresses a desire – the desire to be seen by Rose again – that Pearl craves in the deepest part of herself. She only started to believe in herself through Rose’s eyes. &gt; If this theory is right, she only began to believe that was capable of agency and nobility and autonomy, *because Rose believed it of her*. Pearl’s love for Rose, and Rose’s love for her, formed the very core of her self-belief, which is why it was so punishing to realise that Rose actually didn’t trust her with everything. &gt; And yet, while that realisation hurt her deeply, it didn’t destroy her. It didn’t destroy her partly because of Steven’s intervention, but also partly because while Pearl’s relationship with Rose is still deeply, crucially important to her, it’s no longer the sum of her self-belief. &gt; Rose helped her get from a point of nonindividuality (”a pearl”) to a point of love-based dependent individuality (”my pearl”), but her story didn’t stop there. &gt; By choosing to continue Rose’s work in protecting earth, Pearl gave herself purpose. By making a place for herself with Garnet and Amethyst, she was able to turn her caste-name into something that specified her as an individual. By continuing to devote herself to what and who she loves, she gave herself permission to look for her own happiness. &gt; With all the respect in the world to the Pearl-is-autistic headcanon (which I love and leave a lot of room for in my own reading of the show), I think maybe *that’s* what Jasper was referring to when they called Pearl “defective”. &gt; Jasper probably looks at Pearl, and sees her hard-won individuality as a programming error in a robot built for servitude. A “non-defective” pearl would probably be indistinguishable from other pearls, would follow orders without question, and would have no emotional attachments that could get in the way of their duties. &gt; Pearl is not standardised and weaponised for use by the higher gems, so she is seen as ‘broken’. Even Pearl’s clothes (her bow, her ballet slippers) feel much too idiosyncratic and specific to her to be standard Gem attire; they’re probably also part of what Jasper sees as Pearl’s abnormality, her “defectiveness”. &gt; Ultimately, I feel like Jasper looks at Pearl and probably just sees a tool that has forgotten its place. [(Source)](http://becausegoodbye.tumblr.com/post/115664863609/i-have-a-lot-of-feelings-about-pearl-okay) To that, I'll add an excerpt from my past post as well. &gt; When my mother got the news of my diagnosis, she cried...You know what she told me? **She told me I was ""defective"", that I would never be ""her perfect little girl"".** &gt; **Nobody, not even my teachers or parents, seem to understand what I was going through. They didn't even *try* to understand.** &gt; My parents just saw me as just another child they needed to shove back into the box, that my cries for help - **for someone, *anyone* to understand** - were signs of a ""defiant"" child. The message was that they didn't want to deal with me, and honestly, neither my parents or teachers did know *what* to do with me. &gt; ...Much like Pearl, especially with the Sardonyx fiasco, my psychologist and teacher saw me as ""manipulative and lacking empathy"" at times. In short, I think that Pearl had suffered, likely for a long time, as I had suffered. If the ""Pearls are servants"" theory is, indeed, true, there is also some possibility - given Pearl's mindset, words, and behavior - that she may have previously been abused. Perhaps not by Rose, but by those she previously served. She probably knew, much like in my earlier post, that she was ""different"" from early on - that she was ""defective"". In turn, due to this, Pearl knew that she would never be fully accepted back into Gem society on Homeworld - an outcast - should she ever decide to return. This realization, in turn, caused a profound, deep self-awareness of Pearl of just how *alone* she was. Not only was she ""different"" than all of the other Pearls - she wasn't ""normal"" - but due to being ""defective"", she was forever cut off from them, and the idea (and fantasy) of ""what could have been"". In ""Space Race"", much like Lapis Lazuli, Pearl also experiences what appears to be homesickness...or strong nostalgia for the past. Pearl still longs for that wistful remembrance of what things *could* have been like, if she'd been ""normal"". However, at the same time, Pearl has to face the stark reality that she *is* an outcast - a misfit. She was doomed to be alone and ostracized from the start, and Jasper even says as much. Due to this, when Rose decided to take Pearl under her wing - choosing to form a close, personal friendship with her - Pearl became extremely devoted to Rose. So much so, that she would be willing to *die* for her, time and again. A lot of people also call Pearl's love for Rose ""unhealthy"", and I can see why. However, coming from someone who has *experienced* the same kind of devotional, devout love and blind faith that Pearl puts in Rose myself, I see it more so a love born out of Pearl's profound sense of *loneliness*. For all intents and purposes, Pearl was utterly alone, before she decided to serve Rose. This also easily explains why Pearl would sacrifice herself for Rose; Rose was *the first being* to see Pearl as someone ""worthy"" of her friendship, and of her love. The first being to see Pearl as something *other* than just a ""lost, defective Pearl"". As Pearl says herself, ""She [Rose] made me feel like I was *everything*."" When you are so desperate for love, so desperate for affection, that you will do *anything* to have it, you end up with this sort of relationship. When you're told that you're ""nothing"", ""defective"", and belittled and mocked for years and years, you start to wonder - or even believe - that's the truth. This ties into the ""defective Pearl"" mention and possibility of abuse as well. I know; I've been there, several times before, especially with Lacey. That being said, considering all of that, it's easy to see why Pearl was - and continues to be - so distraught over losing Rose, and Rose's decision to sacrifice herself, so that Steven could live. Pearl feels, and reacts, the way she does, because she feels that *Rose was everything she had*. (If not literally, then Rose was a symbolic figure of that in Pearl's life.) Even in the flashback with ""What Can I Do For You"", we see Pearl, not with the other Crystal Gems, but off to the side - distanced from them. This, along with the events of *Rose's Scabbard*, makes it very clear that Pearl, due to her attitude of ""I'm just a Peal"", even feels like an outcast - and alone - among the Crystal Gems. To top it off, Pearl wasn't just fighting for Rose. She was constantly fighting *herself* - all of her fears, insecurities, worries, and negative thoughts about herself. Pearl says in *Ocean Gem*, ""Ugh... I hate fighting me!"", and that could not be more true. For a long time, I, too, warred a lot with myself. I battled the crushing onslaught of negative thoughts, prompted and reinforced by years of bullying and abuse on all sides. On one hand, I wanted to believe that I didn't deserve this - that God loved me, and would one day ""save me"" from all of the pain and suffering. On the other hand, part of me began to *believe* that I deserved it, because I was ""different"" - that I was ""defective"" and ""weak"". One thing that Pearl mentions in particular is ""strength"", particularly ""being strong in the real way"". She says, ""there are... different ways of being strong"", and sings to Steven, ""And I want to inspire you / I want to be your rock / And when I talk / It lights a fire in you"". But the only reason why Pearl would be singing about this in the first place *is because she doesn't feel like she's ""strong""*. The reason *why* Pearl says ""strong in the real way"" is because she is constantly doubting herself - when Rose was there, everything Pearl mentions (about Steven) *was her view of Rose*. It was *Rose* that inspired Pearl, and *Rose* that was Pearl's ""rock"". When Rose talked, it gave Pearl the courage and confidence in order to believe in herself. Yet with Rose's passing, Pearl feels that she lost all of that. Still, however, Pearl fights - not just for Steven, but her own inner demons, and her feelings of ""not being strong enough"" or ""weak"". She fights because Rose, and now Steven, gives her something very precious: *hope* that things will get better. (This is also referenced when Steven inspires Pearl to fight Sugilite in the same episode. Just when Pearl wants to give up, Steven rekindles her hope, and she succeeds.) In the end, *hope* - in the form of Steven - is the only thing that Pearl has left. It's the only thing keeping her (and I) fighting. Pearl's inner struggle reminds me of an old Cherokee legend. An old grandfather told his grandson: ""My son, there is a battle between two wolves inside us all. One is evil. It is anger, jealousy, greed, and resentment. The other is good. It is joy, love, hope, humility, kindness, empathy, and bravery."" The boy thought about it, and asked, ""Grandfather, which wolf wins?"" The old man quietly replied, ""The one you feed."""	stevenuniverse
Thyroid and Polyphasic?	"Hello, I have always felt monophasic sleep is wrong for me but I am told by doctors that the only good sleep for someone with hypothyroidism is 8-10hrs solid. When I was undiagnosed, I would sleep only when I was tired, and it made me feel better. That meant 4-5 hours a week at times. About 5 months before diagnosis, I suddenly could not sleep enough, and would sleep for 28-40 hrs at a time, completely unwakeable. I hope you can understand this made me very much dislike sleeping at all... The disorientation and looks of terror I'd awake to we're not fun. I tried Everyman 3 for a while, and I had trouble and blamed it on the odd pattern, but I now know that my efforts to nap when I was scheduled but not sleepy (melatonin) were actually making my thyroid problem worse and that was why it made me feel bad. I don't like sleeping in long blocks of time- it reminds me of the ""I thought you were in a coma"" times. I also dont want to feel as horrible as I did when I tried it before. I have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism... For anyone who does not know what that is, it is an autoimmune disease. TL;DR- I have thyroid problems and immune problems and I want to know if anyone out there knows anything about the effects of polyphasic sleep on those two things."	polyphasic
Billionaire Caudwell's tears over son's Lyme disease	"John appears on the show at 9 minutes in and talks about how his family have suffered with undiagnosed Lyme disease. I""m sure a lot of us can relate to John's story regardless of whether there is any suasion of Lyme specifically. I was diagnosed with ME in 2010 and was bitten by a tick in 2006 and am convinced that Lyme is my problem yet I have not been tested and listening to John talk I feel I have to find out somewhere to be tested. If anybody has any info on the correlation between Lyme and ME and were reliable tests are carried I would be very grateful to hear what you think."	cfs
