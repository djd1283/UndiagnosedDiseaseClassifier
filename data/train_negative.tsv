Inventory Wiped - Can't Interact w/ anything in the world	Everything has been fine in the last week of playing until the last 30 minutes. First of all Realms started lagging (Happens a few times a day yet isn't my internet) and I decided to relog to see if it was my Internet. After doing various speed tests it wasn't an issue on my side. The lag continued so I closed and reopened the realm. I can currently load in after an extreme delay on chunk generation yet my inventory is cleared and I can not open any item such as my chests, brewing stands and furnaces. This is honestly frustrating but what is the actual problem? I'm super close to just cancelling my realms subscription because this has honestly frustrated me.	realms
Help with Archer C7 AC1750 router	"All, My trusty Archer C7 is dropping the 2.4GHz band about once a day for seemingly no reason. Devices will still be able to connect to it, but they all show, ""connected, no internet."" Turning it off and back on works, and I just leave the modem running (comcast, it's my own modem, an old surfboard 8x4 that I'll need to upgrade soon). Should I reset to factory settings then make sure it's on the most recent firmware, and if that doesn't work, buy a new router? Never had to troubleshoot one of these before. If I were to upgrade, what would y'all recommend? The Archer A7, or something else? And a random bonus question, if I wanted to put a router in a shed at the corner of my property, could I just run a 200 ft cat5e cable to it, and set up the router as an access point, or is there a better way to do that? (shed has its own circuit breaker panel if that matters)."	HomeNetworking
Problem setting up Pro controller with BetterJoy	"Hey all, I have been trying to set up my switch pro controller using BetterJoyforcemu. Ultimately I'm going to be using the controller for PJ64 but I wasn't able to get any help from the JP64 sub. I definitely plan to use Cemu in the future if I can get my controller working! I can connect the controller via Bluetooth, I can ""locate"" the controller in BetterJoy and get vibration feedback, and the home button is lit up blue (I can hit the home button to open up the game menu and within this menu I can use the controller joystick). But when I click on ""Map Buttons"" within BetterJoy, it only shows options for capture, home, SL/SR for left and right joycons, and a greyed out Re-center Gyro button. I've downloaded and installed all the drivers according to the instructions, and I'm not sure what else I can try. The system I'm using is a pretty basic up-to-date Lenovo laptop running Windows 10, 4GB RAM, CPU @2.7GHz. Any ideas?"	cemu
Does anyone know of a place taking back empties?	It's getting a bit ridiculous at this point that grocery stores and deps are still not taking back consignes/deposits on beer bottles and cans. The Ontario beer store has re-started accepting empties but everywhere I go here in Montreal, it seems like there is always a sign saying consigne non-accepte. Anyone know of a place accepting returns?	montreal
Looking for guild	Hi guys, Like the titles says, I'm looking for a guild (semi hardcore raiding but also casual). I have a lvl 60 undead warlock almost full bis and started raiding. So far I just have experienced ZG and Mc. All my guilds so far having been raiding around 18.30/19.00. For me that's way to early and I always lose my spots or miss most parts of the raid wich means also loot. So I'm looking for a guild who is raiding a Lil later like 20.30 or 21.00 if that even exist. Because I have kids it's not possible for me to get online earlier, that's why I'm mostly late. I guess the fathers can relate to that dilemma :p Atm I'm a warlock horde side on zandalar tribe eu but I'm willing to Transfer to another realm if u guys want me :) If u are already on zandalar tribe that's even beter. Hope to hear from you guys soon üòÅ	classicwow
Do you think alcohol wholesalers should be allowed to sell to the public?

Does saying pet names like ‚Äúmy sweetheart‚Äù in good morning texts mean he‚Äôs into me?	"I've been talking to/dating this guy for a few months. We haven't been able to hang out much because of quarantine but he texts me every day and in the morning they usually are something along the lines of ""good morning beautiful/cutie/sweetie."" This morning he said ""good morning my sweetheart."" Do you think these are just nice statements to keep me interested and are things that he says to anyone or do you think it actually shows more interest than that? Saying ""my sweetheart"" sounds more intentional and serious than the other sayings. I know I could just ask him what we are and if he's interested in more but I just thought I'd get all of your opinions!"	relationship_advice
Do you calorie count while doing IF?	Hi, I'm really new to IF and I just have a question. Do most people calorie count as well as doing IF? I used a calculator to find out I should only be eating 1200 calories a day if I want to lose weight but I feel so hungry when I'm doing that with IF. I do 16/8 and eat from 11-7pm. I'm not sure if it's common to do both and if you do do both, how are you satisfied? I'm sorry if my questions seem awkward, I'm really interested in the community! I just want some help/advice.

Would you want private lobby warzone missions?	By this I mean, say you only have 1 buddy to play with and you don‚Äôt want to be put in a warzone with 2 other random people. You would go into a private warzone mission instead of a public one, and that would put you in a warzone with just you and you‚Äôre buddy, nobody else. This leads to my next question, would you want the rest of your squad to be AI‚Äôs or just not there at all? Options to fill the squad with AI or not would be awesome because options are always great to have, but if I had to choose I‚Äôd say no AI. I bring this up because I‚Äôd personally love to do co-op warzones, and it‚Äôd be a nice challenge to take on a warzone with only 2 avengers. Using an iconic duo to play with like cap and widow, or Thor and hulk just seems fun and would force a lot more teamwork and synergy between characters that compliment each other‚Äôs skills.

Tips on Recovering from a Binge Sesh & Associated Shame/ Disappointment?	I‚Äôve been great about sticking to calorie limits (1750) for the first time in my life. Made it to about 5 weeks, and posted on r/progresspics (my main motivation), but deleted my post with the progress I was so proud of after receiving too many sexual DMs. Since then, I‚Äôve felt very low energy (‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù), have been oversleeping and had 3 days where I massively oversnacked (with an extra 2000+ calories). Does anyone have tips for renewing hope and motivation? I was so excited to watch the numbers on my scale go down, and now it all feels so out of reach/ pointless when I can wreck it all as easily as running to the store and eating too big a bag of chips. And it sucks to not be able to share my progress. Being sexualized for normal pics of my body just makes me want to hide my body and never show off my progress again.	loseit
Why is there no interest on damage deposits?	I alway thought there would be interested added to damage deposits, since I believed they went into the landlord's bank account for holding until being returned to the tenant. I checked out this handy NS gov [calculator](https://novascotia.ca/sns/access/land/residential-tenancies/security-deposit-interest-calculator.asp#calculator) to find out that there is in fact 0% interest since 2013. Does the money go somewhere else, not to the landlord, when you pay it? I thought we email-transferred ours directly to our landlord a few years ago when we moved in. Looking for some clarification, and hoping to learn something new here :)	halifax

It would be interesting if a feature was added that lets you directly click on Monika, ie when you click on her head it's a headpat, when you click on her cheek it's a kiss, when you click on her bo- you get that point.

Myth: You Can Make A Good Career Out of Field Data Collection	Lots of newcomers and fresh grads have interest in GIS because of the idea of getting out in the field collecting data. Im open to being proven wrong, but as a whole after 10 years in this career and multiple industries, I generally feel that field data collection is always seen as a lower paying or entry level position. I actually know a guy who tried making a career out of data collection but after 15 years of doing it he was so far behind on office skills he couldnt be promoted. Another guy I knew worked as an arborist and the pay was low and he was constantly being bounced around the country every couple of months. Now this isnt to say there are not predominantly office jobs that offer occasional field collection days, but more often than not those collection days are ‚Äúrewards‚Äù for getting all the office work caught up with. If you have a job that is more field than office and you think your salary is competitive, let us know, but I wanted to dispel the myth that most GIS jobs are not field based, and if they are they are considered entry level.	gis

Glorious Freedom	"NOT LOOKING FOR ADVICE OR ANYTHING! JUST SHARING MY STORY! This post is late, but it is still due. On Saturday, my wife and I drove 2.5 hours away to pick up my brand new 2020 Iron 1200 in Barracuda Silver (a must). My brother lived in the city I picked the bike up in and he met me there on his bike (2019 Yamaha Bolt C-Spec). Prior to picking this bike up, I had minimal experience. I completed the Harley MSF course in January and haven't been in the saddle since. That all changed when I picked up this beaut. After a couple of laps around the Harley Dealership, it was time. With an abundance of caution, my brother and I, with my wife and pup following in a car behind us, we were out of the parking lot driving off into the city of wonder. Before I knew it, I was up to 55MPH (speed limit) and the wind was relieving my years of stress. By Saturday evening, the bike was broken in (according to the service manager at Harley, ride 45 minutes shifting through all the gears and all RPM ranges, let cool 20 min, ride 45 min. again, and cool again, this will break a motorcycle in when you live in the mountains). Over the course of the weekend, my brother, who was beyond supportive and provided just enough constructive criticism, had pushed me just out of my comfort zone. We rode down empty streets, busy roadways, highway stretches, mountain curves, and everything in between. I wasn't so far out of my comfort zone as to where an accident was imminent. I was pushed out just enough to where I didn't have a choice but to experience what the world had to offer. He rode at his speed in the twisties, I rode at mine. As any great leader of a group ride would, he waited for me when the time was right. I was never pushed to run faster or to place myself in dangerous situations. Come yesterday around 4 PM, our weekend of riding was concluded, together anyway. When we split ways, he had a 1-hour commute home and I was looking at a daunting 2.5-hour commute home. We exchanged blessings of safe commutes and the normal ""love ya's"" that we do, and off we were to our homes. After the weekend riding with him, I was a lot less intimidated by the long commute home (my wife was also behind me the whole way with the pup watching from the back seat). I quickly realized that due to all the experience I was given over the weekend, this commute was nowhere near as daunting. In fact, it was peaceful and exhilarating at the same time. No jitters, no fear, just fun. By 8 PM last night, the bike was parked and my wife and I were enjoying some rest and relaxation after a long weekend. What a time to be alive. For this weekend, and the days, years, decades to follow, the ride made me forget the current state of affairs, my daily stressors, and anything and everything that didn't pertain to the ride. Alas, I am now part of the family, not just the motorcycle community, but the Harley Davidson community. TL;DR: Bought 2020 Iron 1200 in Barracuda Silver. Brother and I rode all weekend, broke her in, put over 250 miles on her, and made a 2.5-hour commute back to the home city as a 3rd-day rider."	Harley

There is absolutely no reason for this game to be as addictive as it is, and that every player has fallen down the ‚Äúone more day‚Äù hole.

Try not to use technology for the last few hours of your day (if you can).	Most of the time I gave into porn and masturbating was when I was browsing my phone in the late evening. Because I have to spend so much time at home during the current lock down, I stop using technology around 9 pm every day and I usually read until it's bedtime. It's been very helpful and definitely a contributing factor for me getting past the 50 day streak! I think if we want to fight our addictions and get better, we need to be willing to make changes that challenge our comfort zone.	NoFap

I have been promoted to moderator.	"Hello everyone. I apologize in advance if I have been posting too much. I had a nice reflection on Submitters that I wanted to share with everyone, but I am going to hold off on it until tomorrow. I have been selected by the staff as one of the moderators for the subreddit, and I am honored to be a part of the team. Honestly, I don't feel fully up for the challenges, and I don't intend to ""exact justice"" on everything I disagree with, as that is abusive. My primary goals as a moderator is to moderate, like a moderator in a civil debate. I don't tolerate insults between the ummah, and we are not encouraged to act like this directly from the Quran. In order to be a hospitable sub, I ask the community to help me not delete comments, lock threads, or ban members. I'd prefer I'd never have to use these. I prefer to maintain the traditional moderator role by allowing discussions to naturally progress. As always, I do not care if someone is straight, gay, lesbian, Sunni, Shia, Amadhiyya, Ex-Muslim, or any type of Muslim. I do not care if they come from Iran, the United States, or India. I do not care if they took Arabic classes at Al-Azhar or not fluent in Arabic and can't recite Al Fatihah. We have come together in a very distinct time in human history where we now can talk to people openly in a forum where it was impossible to do no less than 30 years ago. Let keep it that way. May God help me make sound decisions to help my brothers and sisters of this subreddit. May God bless you as well."	Quraniyoon

Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2 - Most Essential Everyday Jacket Review (YouTube)	Hi all, Posted this review in the Arc'teryx sub with positive responses, and thought I share in the BIFL sub as it definitely qualifies. When people think of Arc'teryx, they usually associate the brand with Climbing, Skiing, Hiking and maybe even Trail Running or Biking. And those that are very familiar Arc'teryx know that their products are some of the most expensive outdoor apparel but built with high standards of quality and perhaps the best warranty in the business, that makes the product you've invested in truly BI4L. However, what most people do not know that Arc'teryx also sells high quality military spec'd products to Law Enforcement and Armed Forces (LEAF). And one of the most popular jackets from Arc'teryx, the Atom LT, has a LEAF version, the Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Gen 2, which can be used as an everyday BI4L spring/fall and mild winter jacket. Below is a 2 Part comprehensive YouTube Review of the Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2, outlining why it should be considered the best most essential everyday spring/fall jacket. **Part 1** \- Outlines MUST and SHOULD Criteria and Candidates for Comparison [https://youtu.be/MLVf0gC7rAs](https://youtu.be/MLVf0gC7rAs) **Part 2** \- Visual and Hands On Review \- Comparison of Product Feature Differences and Advantages over the civilian Atom LT Hoody \- Hood, Shell, Liner comparisons vs other Arc'teryx jackets \- Fit and Layering Options \- Pros and Cons Summary [https://youtu.be/H8GtwJ2uizs](https://youtu.be/H8GtwJ2uizs) Please forgive the length of each video, as I wanted to be thorough in the comparisons and provide as much detail covering all the key technical aspects and benefits for the everyday user of the LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2, as there are not too many reviews on this jacket. Feel free to comment either here or in the YouTube comments section; and whether there are other jackets that should have been considered based on the criteria or have any questions on the LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2 jacket itself. Cheers!	BuyItForLife

Babies are ugly and a drain on resources and I don't understand why anybody wants them	So a lot of people see babies and think they're cute and they want their own. Where does that come from, where do you get that? I'm usually the only girl at family reunions who refuses to hold the baby. Partially because I'm afraid I'll drop it but more than that I don't want them to cry or shit or throw up on me. That's another thing, everyone things its adorable when babies do gross shit. Plus to have one of those little fuckers you have to keep it inside of you for 9 months. Seemingly 9 months of body ruining, misery, having to avoid things you like, not being able to have fun and at the end of it you have to push a human outside of you. Why do people choose this? And then when the baby is born it costs so much to raise it properly. A permanent financial drain. And after all of that shit what do you get? Another human who has to exist in the real world now. And there's a chance of your kid being handicapped which can change the course of your life into a permanent caretaker. How do people look past all of this and still decide that after everything they want a baby? As far as I know this is very unpopular because roughly 360,000 people are born a day.	unpopularopinion

Did socialite Ann Woodward accidentally shoot and kill her wealthy husband? Or did she murder him and cover it up? Did famed author Truman Capote reveal the truth about the death in his gossipy tell all that blew the doors off high New York society? And why did she take a cyanide pill?	"This is a new one to the sub. Very interesting with high power players. Ann Woodward was a nightclub dancer and radio actress in the 1940s when she met William Woodward Jr the heir to the Hanover National Bank fortune and the Belair Estate and stud farm and legacy. He was a VERY wealthy man and a big player in NY high society. Allegedly William's father, William Sr had an affair with Ann, then he introduced her to his adult son William Jr who also had an affair with her. Then he divorced his wife and married her. (Insert ""The Aristocrats"" joke here https://www.vulture.com/2012/08/diving-deep-into-the-dirtiest-joke-ever-in-the-aristocrats.html ) William's ex wife was convinced Ann was a gold digger, William obviously disagreed. >The Woodward marriage was reportedly turbulent. Both had affairs, drank frequently and often argued publicly.[8] Ann also began abusing prescription drugs Not so happy ending there. Here is the murder >After attending a dinner party for Wallis Simpson on October 30, 1955, Woodward and his wife returned to their home in Oyster Bay, New York. Both were nervous about reports of a prowler roaming nearby estates, including their own. The Woodwards, both avid hunters, each went to their separate bedrooms that evening with loaded shotguns. >A few hours later, Ann heard a noise on the roof and went into a darkened hallway with her gun, where she saw a shadowy figure standing in front of Woodward's bedroom door. Believing the figure to be a prowler, Ann fired the gun, killing her husband.[9] Upon arriving at the home, police found Ann holding her husband's body and sobbing. She immediately confessed that she had shot her husband because she thought he was a burglar. Ann testified in front of a grand jury and no charges were filed. William's mother then stepped in. The bizarre part here is that it seems like she both suspected her DIL of murder and also helped her with an alibi. >Police later arrested a man named Paul Wirths, who admitted that he had attempted to break into the Woodwards' house on the night of the shooting.[4] Wirths claimed that he had been scared by the sound of gunshots and then left.[10] Woodward's mother Elsie, however, believed that the shooting had been deliberate but publicly supported her daughter-in-law in order to avoid further scandal.[11] **There was speculation that Elsie had paid Wirths to say he had attempted to break into the home in an effort to exonerate Ann** so that was that, things calmed down. That's when famed author and NY high society gad about town Truman Capote comes into the picture. Truman was a fixture at high society parties after writing ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and the true crime classic ""In Cold Blood"" which revolutionized crime writing. >In 1975 Truman Capote published excerpts of his unfinished novel Answered Prayers in Esquire, which scandalized high society.[10] The novel's characters were based on Capote's real-life acquaintances who were prominent socialites of the time.[6][2] The novel revealed scandals and issues within the lives of William S. Paley, Babe Paley, Happy Rockefeller, Gloria Vanderbilt, and Woodward. In the novel, Capote based a character named Ann Cutler, a bigamist and gold digger who shoots her husband, off of Woodward's killing of her husband, implying that it was murder and >The character of Ann Hopkins is then introduced when she surreptitiously walks into the restaurant and sits down with a pastor. Ann Hopkins is likened to Ann Woodward. Ina Coolbirth relates the story of how Mrs. Hopkins ended up murdering her husband. When he threatened to divorce her, she began cultivating a rumour that a burglar was harassing their neighbourhood. The official police report says that while she and her husband were sleeping in separate bedrooms, Mrs. Hopkins heard someone enter her bedroom. In her panic, she grabbed her gun and shot the intruder; unbeknownst to her the intruder was in fact her husband, David Hopkins (or William Woodward, Jr.). Ina Coolbirth suggests however, that Mr. Hopkins was in fact shot in the shower; such is the wealth and power of the Hopkins' family that any charges or whispers of murder simply floated away at the inquest. The fallout of Capote's book was huge. He was forever shunned form high society for revealing their dirty laundry. But for Ann it was just too much. >Answered Prayers caused such a scandal prior to its release, that Woodward killed herself by taking cyanide later that year.[11][9] Her body was discovered on October 10, 1975 in her apartment on Fifth Avenue. Her mother in law said of her death, ""she shot my son, and Truman just murdered her, and so now I suppose we don't have to worry about that anymore.""[6] Subsequently, both of Woodward's sons committed suicide; James in 1976 and William in 1999 So nearly everyone in that family died, either of possible murder or suicide. Truman never finished another book and descended into alcoholism and drugs which eventually killed him.

Anyone else feel like the game has been 'inspected'?	The sudden, huge, reduction in farming requirement is actually quite startling, to the point they're going to limit the resource courses to a daily thing. A lot of people interpret that as a stamina system but let's say the new way gives us enough resources it could be said they have been told by higher ups that the game is far too grindy to attract new players rather than a limit it could be a window for a friendlier arrival for new players.

respect people's pronouns	&#x200B; Its simple respect, just respect how others want to be treated as such. You don't have to agree with them even, but you should just always respect everyone. Asking for someone's pronouns should also be more common. People that disrespect pronouns because they don't agree with a gender non conforming person's ideologies is just an asshole. Just treat people nicely. edit: damn holy fuck a lot of you are assholes &#x200B;	teenagers

I think BF6 will return faith to the community.	One of my biggest frustrations with Dice is when the team split for Battlefront 1. I knew resources diverted would impact the Battlefield series and 5 is proof of that, hell even the launch of Battlefront 2 shows a lot. I feel like with the whole team back together creativity will spark within them. Hopefully the upper management changes because of this too, because we know they have been a huge factor in the downfall of V. I think everyone should be cautious and have a wait and see approach to the next game but I am optimistic about 6.	BattlefieldV

[Spoilers]Is 90 Day Fianc√® like No Sleep? Are we just supposed to pretend it's real?	I like this show, but I just don't know how to approach it. So, we go through this whole thing with David and Lana. We're supposed to believe Lana isn't real: she doesn't talk to him off the pay to chat site, they never speak on the phone (I think?), she never shows up, her picture is on a million websites, etc. Much like with Cesar. And then **WHOOP* there she is!! Did TLC find her and hire her? It makes no sense. But it makes sense if you think about this as a fiction. Was it all made up? Cesar has an acting career and his catfish showed up at the tell all, lots of shock and awe when she showed up at the tell all. What a plot twist! Then the same woman shows up with 90 Day's resident villian, Jesse. And by now it's obvious Jesse is purposefully a bad guy, or a foil, or a heal, whatever. He knows we all (?) hate him, or love to hate him if you're me. But now we have Tom. Two bad guys? Or will Jesse have a character arch and see what happened with Tom and Darcy and come to Darcy's aid? And then Tom will become our new heal. I'm calling it, Williams in some form is going to show up. Maybe the show will dig up the model to tell whatshername that she's being catfished. Is any of it real? Are we just supposed to pretend it's real? What do you do? Am I being pandantic?	90DayFiance

T2 mats for newer players	Hello all, I am not short myself (50,000 of them) but 3 of my alliance pals are short on T2 ability Mats. As we run U7 daily and have done for a while there has been very little in terms of T2s for them. Legacy players were stuck doing U6 for a long time building up a ton of these mats. Newer players don't have that U6 rut. I only see 2 options. 1. Kick them to find an alliance doing U6 or 2. We run U6 a few times a week. Neither seem great tbh. It takes about 20 weeks of U6 daily to get 20,000 (including the challenges). Anyone out there dealt with this? Would appreciate input.	MarvelStrikeForce

Justin as a DM?	"in an amnesty TTAZZ (i think the last one, could be wrong) justin mentioned maybe dming the next campaign (but that itd likely be travis who'll be the dm, which is what ended up happening). personal opinions about previous campaigns aside, i got to wondering what a justin-led campaign would be like, because unless theres a maxfun campaign hes led, hes the only one we havent seen as a dm. i think he has a good eye for pointing out when a scenes dragging along, and he has a pretty good handle on not only his own characters (obviously with some fumbles while finding his footing, but most people do when theyre playing a new character), but also a good eye for pointing out when another character is acting ooc (clint even credits justin as helping him get a grasp on neds character, because he pointed out ned was doing something ooc), which is a really useful skill as a dm. people tend to criticise him for those aspects though, mostly because its the way he goes about it (blunt and rude). whether he's joking around or actually mocking seems to vary from person to person, and the only person who can answer that is justin. my personal thought is that theyre family, and while families can definitely hurt eachother (intentionally or not), its more likely that they know each other better than strangers on the internet would? id say whether hes joking or mocking seems to be interpreted based on peoples personal projections as well (ie with graduation i feel like hes more frustrated than usual because im frustrated with graduation itself). hes also really good at creating a wide variety of characters, from the more charismatically flamboyant tv chef taako to the reluctant ""chosen"" hero charisma vacuum duck to *pepsi liberty*, and every character inbetween. its likely that they stand out from each other because theyve never had to interact, but he has a knack for creating characters that are incredibly distinct and is able to pull them off well, and is way more focused on creating interesting characters than heroic ones. obviously this is all just speculation and the only way to know would for him to actually dm, and if hes not actually interested in being a dm then thatd probably make for a rough campaign if his heart isnt into it, but all that aside i was wondering what other peoples thoughts were? dont want to turn this into a 'justin *should* dm' thread, just a 'what would it be like *if* he did' thread"	TheAdventureZone

Just bought an old apartment. Best way to fix plaster wall where it meets a windowsill?	Hey all. First place I've ever owned, so I have to take this on and fix it myself. Should be a fun learning process. The apartment has old plaster walls (pre-war), and i have to fill a bunch of nail holes and stuff from the previous owner.

Survival (Day 1 : Part 2)	Walking from edge of the forest a ‚ÄúDeer‚Äù like creature moved toward us. I say ‚ÄúDeer‚Äù like creature because it at first glance resembled said animal. At first glance. Once you really looked at it then you saw the difference from a Deer and this animal. The head was similar to that of a deer but, the massive spread of antlers were far too extensive to be that of a deer. How it moved through the thick forest with that spread, I did not know. Next difference was the front legs. Thin like a deer‚Äôs, but longer. It shouldn‚Äôt be just walking towards us. Any normal animal would have run the moment it saw us. Instead it was walking calmly in our direction. It was taller than a deer, but with the same elegant stride. It reached us and continued through giving us no mind. I noted as it got closer that there were more differences to this creature and a Deer. This animal had not one, but two pairs of hind legs. It made its way through us and moved on toward the far end of the clearing. Where it stopped at the edge of the wood, looked about then leaped high in the air and disappear into the woods. For a good ten to fifteen minutes we stood there looking after the animal, that had just walked through us. Too stunned to say anything. Then Someone breathe out, ‚ÄúDid you see the rack on that deer?‚Äù With that the spell was broken and everyone turned to me. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù was the thought everyone had. For about an hour after that, myself and several others made the trip to the river. We were not sure what else to do. I had decide to just start gather my flint like rocks so that I could make tools. RJ and some of the people continued to work on the shelter. What else could we do. I had made three trips, when Sergeant Samuel and her group appeared through the hole in the bushes we had made. In her hand dangled a rabbit like animal. She waved at me. I dropped the load I was carrying, and jogged over. ‚ÄúI just walked up to it. It didn‚Äôt even try to run away? I was able to just reach down and kill it. What the hell is going on? It should have been afraid of us, but nothing. I only saw a few animals. I also noted something too.‚Äù Samuels side as I approached. She stepped to one side and let her group through. Some of them had different berries and small animals. The berries looked like some kind of Blueberries, but the wrong color of blue. ‚ÄúAre the berries good to eat?‚Äù I asked. A woman with dreadlocks spoke up, ‚ÄúI saw the rabbit animals eating them, so they should be OK to eat.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that for sure. So be careful,‚Äù I warned. ‚ÄúWell, if I get sick that should tell us something,‚Äù she replied. I groaned inwardly, but indicated the camp. ‚ÄúFind a clear spot to put the food down,‚Äù I instructed, then turned to Srg. Samuel. ‚ÄúWhat did you note?‚Äù I asked. She watched as everyone filed past her then spoke. ‚ÄúThe animals are not afraid of us, but they are afraid of something.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat did you see, to make you think that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI saw one of the local birds on our way around. I saw it before it saw us. When it heard us approaching it started to go higher into the trees, but then it saw us it stopped and moved back down to get a better look at us. I swear it was the oddest thing I've ever seen. Well how the bird acted, then again I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt see a bird like that before too. Anyhow, the behavior of the animals is strange. I can't explain, but here is something that is scaring the wildlife. It could be regular predators, but I think it‚Äôs something more. There is something else out there, I‚Äôm certain of it.‚Äù I told her about the deer animal and I thought about what she had said. A little later Tim, Rebecca, and their group exited the forest near to where Srg. Samuels had entered. They were laden down with pear like fruit. Tim had a dead bird grasped in his hand. He explained that they had discovered the ‚ÄúPear‚Äù Tree not far from the north edge of the woods, there was a small grove of the trees. Also that there were quite a few birds living in them. I told Samuel and him about the river and the strange fish. Tim wanted to go see the river and Samuel decided to go to. I took them down our rough path and showed them the river. We arrived just as Mama Fisher and Sheila pulled a big fish from the water. They had a few fishes piled behind them. Mama Fisher called to us as we approached. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had it this easy catching fish before. If I knew this place existed I would have come sooner.‚Äù Tim and Samuel looked up and down the river, inspecting the bank ‚ÄúHave you explored very far either way?‚Äù Srg. Samuel asked. Sheila spoke up, ‚ÄúI started to, but came back to help Mama F.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need to. I don‚Äôt know what resources are around here but we are going to need to find what we can.‚Äù Srg. Samuel stated. Then added, ‚ÄúIt is getting a little late.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe should take back what you have here. We‚Äôve got a good amount of food, and we need to start fires so we can cook.‚Äù I interjected. Everyone agreed and we began to gather up the fish. I had gathered up a armful of fish when I looked across the river. I was able to duck just in time as one of the Six legged deers leaped from one side of the river to the other. It Rushed over me and crashed landed six or seven feet past me. It jumped to its feet and rushed off into the forest. We looked after it for a second then looked back across the river. A group of strange bipedal three foot tall, scaly animals spilled out of the trees on the other side. All I really saw were their big head‚Äôs full of pointed teeth. They rushed down to the water‚Äôs edge and slid to a stop, seeming unwilling to go into the water. They chirped and hooted at each other, and stared across the water at us. Very quietly Tim whispered, ‚Äúeveryone back away slowly. Don‚Äôt make any sudden moves.‚Äù We slowly began to back away, the short velociraptor looking creatures watched us their long tails moving back and forth. We made it to the edge of the woods and scooted over to the hole in the brush we created. The whole time the toothy critter watched us with unblinking eyes. Slowly we retreated down the path till we were out of site. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll,‚Äù I said softly, ‚ÄúI think we found what the other animals are afraid of.‚Äù Mama F breathed out, ‚ÄúDid you see the teeth on those kani‚Äôa?‚Äù Sergeant Samuel stared back the way we came and replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what those monsters are but I think we're going to need to make slight change to our survival plans.‚Äù We gather everyone together once we arrived back at camp and explained what we had seen. Everyone asked what we were going to do about this threat? The only thing I could think of was to build a wall round our camp and hope the predators couldn‚Äôt jump. Also I was starting to feel glad I had gather some of the flint like rocks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need to build defensive's, for now wooden wall‚Äôs to keep the predators out. If anyone knows how to flint knap come help me work on some flint tools. Everyone else needs to stay close to camp. Don‚Äôt wander off alone. If you need to go out into the woods go in groups. We still need more wood and stuff for fire.‚Äù I indicated the man I had put in charge of wood gathering. ‚ÄúHow much have we gathered?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWe should have enough gathered to last all night. But if we have to start using it for other stuff it won't last long.‚Äù I thought about that for a second. ‚ÄúOK, we need to start getting fires going. Everyone who know how to start a fire need to do so. I‚Äôll start on making flint tools. We need people to keep a lookout. Four or five people need to go back down to the river and keep an eye out there. If you think you see any of the creatures get back here ASAP. We‚Äôll try and be ready for them.‚Äù Everyone went to it. Myself, Edward, and three other people sat down with our stones and began to work on them. I got the flint like stone a little longer than my hand. With harder stone began to carefully chip at the flint stone. It was harder to do then with regular flint but I seemed to get the same result. I keep the chips that came off, I could use them for other stuff later. Chip by chip I began forming my ax head. It took at least a hour to do one ax, in which time Mama F and some others had gone back to the river. Not seeing our little friends she and other gathered up the dropped fish. They brought them back and I gave them some of the flint chips so that they could cut and clean out the fish. Our firewood gatherer, Stefen, had brought us some branches so that we could make handles for our axes. While I and the others began making more ax heads, Edward took the branches and stripped them of bark. Taking two stones, one with a point and one to use to hit the pointed one, he began to chisel out a slot that our ax heads could fit in. Doc Bitterbeer had, as he had said he would, taking the bushes we had cut and began making twine with them. When he had gotten eight of them made he gave them to Edward. Edward in turn took the finished ax heads and put one into the slot he had made in a branch and use the twine to secure the ax head to the branch. All that work for just one ax. Edward gave the ax to one of the people helping RJ. That person took the ax and began chopping at a small tree for better wood, to make better shelters. For the rest of the day we made tools. RJ and his group erected shelters. Mama F and six or seven people made trips to the river, guarded by Sergeant Samuel. Tim and Rebecca cleared the brush near to were the ‚ÄòPear‚Äô trees were. Giving Doc more fiber to work with. Tim and Rebecca gathered more of the fruit. A man named Alexander, had began making fire pits and starting fires. Wisely he had lined the fire pits with stones. Mama F had started preparing the fish for eating, once Alexander had the first fire going she took over and began cooking the fish on flat stones. By that time we were sure the berries were safe to eat , the woman with the dreadlocks, Diane, had not gotten sick so we were fairly sure they were good too. All told we had enough food to barely feed all of us. Sergeant Samuel had taking a rough head count, there was about four hundred and six people. Both jet planes must have been fully loaded to take all of us. RJ would not have enough shelters make by night fall so most of us would have to sleep on the ground. With the local insect not bothering us it might not be too bad. The biggest concern was the water. Could we safely drink it? Two of the people with Mama F group had drank some water, and so far they seemed fine. But it was too soon to be sure. I was becoming very parched, and so were others. We might have to risk it, soon. As the sun began to set, my hands were cramped, I had smashed my finger multiple times, my back ached from being hunched over, but in return we had between the five of us had made 10 axes, four spear heads, and three knives. Stefan had not found branches long enough for the spears, because RJ and use so many to make shelters. We would have to wait for the morning to get one of the axes and chop some branches or small trees to make the spear shafts. Mama F gave me a flat stone with a chunk of fish, two slices of the ‚ÄòPears‚Äô (which were fairly hard and tasted like a mix of pear and peaches), also I got a hand full of light blue blueberries ( the tasted like blueberries with a tangy after flavor), and a little of the ‚Äòrabbit‚Äô meat. All in all not a filling meal, but the Fish tasted good, so not a total bummer. Mama F came by a little later with shallow rock with water in it. ‚ÄúI heated up this water, hopefully its safe to drink.‚Äù She said offering me a drink. I drank a little, the hot water tasted like cooked fish and berries, not the normal flavor I like my water. I thanked her and drank a little more, and she moved on to other people. Before trying to lie down for the night I went and found Staff Sergeant Samuel. She had appropriated one of the axes and was keeping watch on the east side of the clearing. ‚ÄúAnything to report,‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo. After first interaction, we haven‚Äôt seen tooth or scale of the little monsters. They could be just inside the treeline for all we know or they could be miles from here. We just don‚Äôt know,‚Äù She said watching the path. ‚ÄúThey seemed hesitant to cross the water. So hopefully they'll not cross over just yet.‚Äù Srg. Samuel glanced side long at me and replied, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll I‚Äôm not going to assume that their not going to cross. We‚Äôll be prepared in any case. I won't feel safe till we at least have a wall between, us and those creatures.‚Äù I nodded in agreement and watch with her till the sun set. I woke sometime in the middle of the night to something I haven't heard since I was a little kid camping with my family in Yellowstone National Park. The long howl drifted on the wind from somewhere far off. It waxed and waned for several minutes. Finally it died down, and it went quiet. I wonder if I could fall back to sleep, with my nerves so unsettled. Then just at the edge of my hearing range from the south came answering howls. Not just one voice, but many. It was too far away for me to make anything out for sure, but there were many different pitches and were held for different amounts of time. Almost everyone was up now listening to the howls. Shocked and pail faces looked at each other. The only thing I knew for sure was without a doubt those were wolf howls. I will never forget the sound of wolves howls. That night, long ago were my brother and I and our parents sat in our camper as a pack of wolves sat not far from us and howled was seared into my memory. Where ever we were there were wolves out there. It almost almost made me believe we were still somewhere at home. That is until I looked and saw many people looking up into the night sky. I looked up too. There sitting in the sky was A moon. Not our moon, this moon look smaller and at its north end an giant crater could be seen. And ridding not too far behind the first moon a smaller moon followed the first. Bright blue light shine off the small moon and a more familiar shine came from the first moon. We were not on earth for sure now. My heart shrank a little with this knowledge. I knew that we were not going home, where every home was we were out here on our own. Unable to get back to sleep, I went to relieve Sergeant Samuel. When I got there another man was waiting there. Sergeant Samuel nowhere in site. The man gave me salute. ‚ÄúPrivate First Class Francis O‚ÄôMalley, USMC. I relived the Staff Sergeant an hour ago, Sir.‚Äù I nodded back at him. I had seen the Marine at the Renaissance Festival the week before, several times in fact. He had been with several other guys at the time too. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt get back to sleep, Sir?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúNo, not after hearing those wolves, and seeing the Two moons,‚Äù I explained. O‚ÄôMalley nodded, and pointed to the horizon. ‚ÄúWell not just two moons,‚Äù he said as I followed his pointed finger. There on the horizon a curve of another moon was just peeking. ‚ÄúIt's been coming up since I‚Äôve on watch.‚Äù I marveled at that fact. The moon was just barely visible a slight sliver on the horizon. ‚ÄúThat's one slow moon,‚Äù I commented. I was slightly startled when Sergeant Samuel‚Äôs voice came from behind us. ‚ÄúIt was trying to get up an hour before O‚ÄôMalley relieved me. It feels like the first two blasted past it.‚Äù Private O‚ÄôMalley came to attention. Samuels waved him off. ‚ÄúAre there any other military folks?‚Äù I question. ‚ÄúNo one who was currently serving,‚Äù was the reply from Samuels. ‚ÄúWhat about the guys I saw you were with during the Renaissance Festival, O‚ÄôMalley?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey left two days ago. Once my little brother had been ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù from the jousting tournament, he and the guys left to go to the beach. I was going back home after the Festival. I‚Äôve got in enough trouble on the beach in the past, so I didn‚Äôt want to go.‚Äù He reminisced. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some people who retired from all branches here. Just not a whole lot. Doc Bitterbeer said he was in the Brazilian medical corp for a couple of years, but got booted out. And I‚Äôve talked to a former British Royal Engineer, Margret was in it from 18 till she was 25. She the closest to an officer we have. But she‚Äôs too gunshy from her experience in Afghanistan, so she‚Äôll be little help if it ever comes to a fight. All the rest are willing and ready to help. I‚Äôve talked to them throughout the day.‚Äù I digested this information, and watch the third moon try rise. Finally I felt tired enough to fall back to sleep. I went back to where my campfire was, and laid down near to it.	stories

Queria ter algu√©m com empatia e algum conhecimento pra poder me escutar e aconselhar. Mas tenho medo de algu√©m me expor! Me fazer mal! Mal consigo comer de ang√∫stia.	desabafos

It will cover all aspects of object oriented programming in python, from creating classes to static methods to composition! Everything is explained clearly in an easy to understand way, and if you don't understand anything, I reply to comments usually within 24 hours. Here is the link to the first video, where I explain classes and instances. The next video will be out tomorrow, explaining methods and attributes: [https://youtu.be/r5BgVJNB5JA](https://youtu.be/r5BgVJNB5JA) I hope those looking into object oriented programming in python will find this useful!

What happened?Why I dont have fun in single player games anymore?I keep uninstalling the games 1 hour after playing...	Hey!Im a 16 years old male and I feel like I cant play single player games anymore even tho I want to. I switched from Ps4 to PC in March,I was soo hyped to try out all the single player games I wanted to play in PC with 60 fps,max graphics and graphic mods.Also online games like Overwatch,R6S,Apex and Gmod.But I was mainly focus to play Single player games again because of the graphics and complet the storyline all by myself. But anyways,I installed Max Payne 3,GTA 5,GTA 4,Sleeping Dogs,Mafia 2,Mafia 3,Ghost recon wildlands,Need for Speed heat,Forza Horizone 4,Watch dogs 1 & 2... But I ended up uninstalling all of them the first hours in.I wanted to complet all of those games by myself because of the amazing graphics in max settings,their story,attention to details,atmosphere,mods and things to do,for NFS And FH,for their luxury and old school cars that I can drift around and do races with it.But nope,I got strangly bored first hours into all of these games.Sometimes I reinstall those games again and STILL uninstall the first hour in!Its like im giving it another change but I dont feel fun playing those games even tho I want to play them so bad if that makes sense! I think I kinda need a 100% savegame so I can enjoy the game and do random stuff in the city but I actually want to do the missions but the beginning of the story in a game is not fun!Even tho I want to play the beginning too because I want to complet the game all by myself in style and know what the story is all about! My situation is so weird.Same for multiplayer games but I find my interest back to a game then not play it for a long time.Like r6s,I start to play it all day,and not touching it until the next weeks.This happens for all the online games I mentionned.Now im currently playing overwatch and Apex.Im sure ill switch up to Gmod and R6s soon for a week then come back on these other games. I really dont know what happen,this didnt happen for me in PS2,PSP and when I start playing in PS4...I completed the games again and again and found sooo much fun in it!Jake and Daxter series is the perfect exemple,I played hours into those games and there was an unforgettable amount of fun for the open world and story!It was flawless! Now I have a PC that I always wished for and wouldnt even stick to the games and finish them like I was doing on console...	gaming

I had an idea to solve the repetitive dialogue options when catching bugs/fish/clams	"If you're familiar with playing any game from the Zelda franchise, you probably know that you get a small dialogue from the first time you collect a rupee the first time you load into your save file. So, for the uninitiated, if you load into your file and collect a red rupee, it will say something like ""You collected 20 rupees, don't spend it all in one place!"" Then every time you collect one after that, it's automatically added to your wallet without the dialogue pop-up. I think this could apply pretty well to animal crossing. Say you load into your file and catch a sea bass, you would get the dialogue as usual. Then, every sea bass you catch afterwards would be automatically added after the animation of catching it. This would reset so that every time you open your game, you get a dialogue pop-up on your first catch and not again until the next time you open animal crossing. I feel it would save some time for players who've seen the prompts multiple times."	AnimalCrossing
I am very sick, weak immune system, disabled, and need my dog.. I‚Äôm scared to be homeless again but it‚Äôs coming soon.	I am 21, almost 22. I do not know if I will have a car or not, depends if my parents wanna be extra f*cked up or not (they have 2 EXTRA). I have $90. rooms here are cheap like $300-400/month, hotels and motels can be more expensive though, i‚Äôm gonna try to call ones i stayed at before with an ex to see if they do discounts for a month.. i really need somewhere i can go with my ESA dog. i should never be alone, i can‚Äôt take care of myself. i can‚Äôt remember the day, the time, sometimes what i‚Äôm even doing, remember my meds, remember where my phone is, or other important things. but i try to be my best when i‚Äôm alone, i just have cognitive issues from my physical illnesses :/ i need to have my dog, but i‚Äôll have to get food and find a place for both of us. she is everything to me and i bought her and trained her as my ESA. i have 2 other dogs i just see as pets, she is actually there for me in other ways. and is friendly, behaved in public, good with all animals, but would be protective if i need her to. like she is good and letting me know when people are around, when i would not notice because of my issues. which is a big fear for me because someone can easily come up and target me and i can‚Äôt defend myself due to my muscle issues and cognitive issues and it‚Äôs scary. i‚Äôve already been a victim of random violent crime in my city so it scares me. i have been sick over a month now with stomach issues my doctor thinks i need my gallbladder out but something was off with my liver too. i have the consult friday. that‚Äôs why i can stay this week. this plus the issues i‚Äôve had since i was 13, 17, i have an incredibly weak immune system. i do have masks, but what triggered my disease was a virus in the first place. so it‚Äôs scary to think if i had to go to a shelter alone without my dog, i‚Äôd probably catch corona and idk it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. i also can‚Äôt really live in a shelter lifestyle, due to my symptoms and limitations and how i need to rest and all that.. and i just seriously am a huge target. i‚Äôm so fucking naive and my illnesses make it worse. my cognitive issues are so bad right now. i‚Äôm considering contacting churches i went to as a kid for assistance but idk what they can do for me.. or how to ask for help i‚Äôm also considering trying to sell stuff to make enough money to get a room for as long as i can. i already posted to craigslist to see if anyone can help accommodate my dog and i for weekly or a month and to lmk how much they‚Äôd charge.. i don‚Äôt wanna do this if i have to be alone and on the street.. being on the street with one person was hard enough and now with the virus, i just feel it‚Äôs too much to even be possible and definitely not worth it i also would have to get a new phone and service which i‚Äôd want straight talk. i don‚Äôt need a lot cause i don‚Äôt do texting/calling/phone stuff like that really	almosthomeless

Wow, the longbow is bad!	Seriously needs a buff. I was using it there with iron sights fired 4 shots at mid range. 37 damage hit again 37 again 37 and again 37. That's 4 perfect bodyshot in a row with a sniper with iron sights not an easy task at distane where my opponent is just a few pixels and he's caustic so he just shrugs it off like it's nothing and gets away. Why would you ever snipe in this game if your rate of fire and magazine size is so low. Every sniper in this game needs a buff. Kraber excluded obviously. What do you think??	apexlegends

[Selling] Kashmina 150mm Blue#2 petty, and Shiro Kamo 165mm Blue#2 Nakiri. [UK/EU]	Hi, First up is a Kashima Warikomi 150mm Blue#2 petty, iron clad (from cleancut, https://www.cleancut.eu/butik/knifetype/allknivar/bunka_warikomi-2470-detail). Octagonal handle, walnut. Pictures here https://imgur.com/a/DqoqsEb This is a cheap petty which usually goes for 80e (+15e cleancut p&p). The F&F is usually not great, but the grind on this particular one is quite good, and it's quite a thin petty with a decent amount of height. I polished the choil area by myself (they come completely unfinished, you can still see some of the machine scratches there which I could not get out by hand), and it has also had a light thinning, and I have used a JNS synthetic aoto to get some of the contrast back. It's not perfect, but IMO it looks better than new (they come with a coating which prevents rust, I have taken this off). I have also sealed the gaps between the steel/handle with beeswax. You can also see there is a slight mark in the handle which is where the stone hit the handle while thinning. The handle otherwise is great (it's pakka ferrule and walnut handle, I've given it a fresh coat of wax). I have sharpened this, so you will get it nice and sharp. The blade and edge itself is straight, and is centered in the handle, although it's twisted slightly, and goes off to one side slightly, but considering the size of the knife, this is not perceptible when you're using it (this is actually the reason I sent back the first 2 petties I bought, but this one didnt bother me) I am selling it for **¬£50** incl P&P (for postage to EU, contact me). If you are not happy, you are welcome to return it, but I think it's a great little knife, very light. I am selling it because I have the smaller version of this petty. Second we have a Shiro Kamo Blue#2 Nakiri (from cleancut again, https://www.cleancut.eu/butik/knifetype/nakiri/nakiri2013-08-22-12-33-182013-08-22-12-33-18-2-detail). Right handed D-shaped handle. Pictures here https://imgur.com/a/o3uWqNF This is a **laser** nakiri. This is as thin as it gets. I have attempted to remove all traces of patina with rust eraser/3000 grit sandpaper, it looks almost like new (the scratches from factory were also perpendicular to the spine so I tried to keep this) but there is some evidence of patina if you look hard enough, but these traces will be gone in a single use as it's really quite reactive. **This has been used about 15 or so times, lightly, and not been sharpened**. It is still sharp, but could do with a touch-up, but I will leave that to you unless you want me to give it a quick sharpen. The F&F is great, the blade is centered perfectly, the edge and spine are straight, the handle is smooth. The grind is very thin, because the blade itself is thin there is some flex. I have sealed a tiny gap between the steel and the handle with beeswax. I have not oiled or waxed the handle yet as it doesn't seem to need it.

Slipped yet again	What do you know? I tried to keep from drinking on my own, and it didn't work. Nothing went according to plan yesterday, and I really pissed off my partner. I thought I would try some controlled drinking, just to be sure, and blacked out. Based on my experience, I will know not to drink for a month or so before I end up with the bottle. I would love to hear some encouraging words from anyone who failed many times before achieving long term sobriety, also, any recommendations are welcome. Thanks for being here y'all!	alcoholicsanonymous

Fair warning - If you were over paid at all the IRS will hold your ENTIRE tax refund until they get things figured out.	In case anyone else is in this situation- My mother was overpaid because she filed as a qualifying widow in 2018. Her 2019 return was over $7000. They held the entire amount for the $1200 that they overpaid, and no one can tell us when the rest will be released. We never received a letter, and the only information we got at all through the IRS portal was that it was being offset for the ENTIRE amount, and to call the treasury. Don‚Äôt be surprised if it happens to you - you‚Äôll get no information.	stimuluscheck
I'm at a loss	Probably should be posting this in /r/relationships but here goes: I want to break up with my current girlfriend. For months now. While I'm happy with our relationship, the fights that we have are unbearable. It usually starts with something minor that I did (taking something I suggested as ordering her around, playful teasing, hell even the playful banters evolve into full blown fights). The thing with these fights is that she's big on amends. She wants me to make up in some way and until I do, she treats me more or less like trash. I think that over the times that this happened, i eventually lost interest in genuinely making amends and just resort to saying whatever just to appease her. Which is not me. And now, it's taking a toll with my mental health. We've been together for over a year, there's been ups and downs, and somehow during those down times I've convinced myself that things will get better. That we'll both be mature enough to deal with arguments better. But it didn't. It's always me having to patch up things with her. Sure, it's all fun when we're not fighting, but when we do, I feel less and less in love with her. But i don't know how to breakup with her. I know that if I do, she'll self-harm, or worse, kill herself. I just know she'll do it. She has issues that I don't think I can help with alone. Being the only reason for her to go on in life isn't good for her either. So yeah, I'm at a loss.	CasualPH

M4F 27 #Bergen - Here to help you socially distance your legs from one another.	Looking for a fun and gorgeous freak that wants to have discrete fun somewhere in NJ. The quarantine has my testosterone peaking and I am very much in the mood to touch, taste, and ravage you. I am muscular and fit with dark features and currently have a beard. I am naturally dominant and enjoy light BDSM, eating pussy and ass, manhandling, and light objectification and degradation. In short, I really just want to use you up and then cuddle you in my arms like a good girl. We can do this all day since everyone is working from home. I can host or come to you. You must be DDF with a recent test. Would be open to raw play if you‚Äôre clean. I am able to exchange pics immediately via Snapchat or Kik. I‚Äôd want to meet up this week. I have not been exposed to anyone with COVID and have been under strict quarantine. Really just want to break quarantine to give you a good dicking. Put your favorite sex song in the subject line and respond with a few kinky ideas you‚Äôd be interested in trying. I am most likely open to your fantasies/fetishes. Don‚Äôt be shy.	NJr4r

Switched batteries, now lights stay on without the key inserted. Any ideas?	So my bike was stolen out of my college apartment complex last month, but the police found it a few days ago and I went to pick it up. It didn‚Äôt seem like anything was missing from it, and it seems like whoever took it just left it outside for a month (fuck me right) The thing started beautifully when I replaced the battery, but after I rode it around the block and took out the key, I noticed all the lights were still on - mainly the headlights and rear light, as if it were still running. Further, you can start it without the key inserted as well. My theory was whoever stole it might‚Äôve tried hot wiring it and screwed up somewhere between the ignition and battery, but I was wondering any of you have had a similar experience. Thanks for your help!	motorcycles

This gem from r/banvideogames	Not all gamers are bad. In fact, there are good ones. For example, I'm a good gamer. I'm not racist and have NEVER said anything racist, I don't support or advocate any form of racism or anything that you people say we promote on this subreddit, and I never will. I don't go and call people disrespectful things. Yeah, I may see inappropriate things in games sometimes, but I don't let that influence me. I know that things I do in games should stay in games. If anything, gaming to me is nothing more than entertainment and a way of passing time. Just because a few gamers have done bad stuff in the past, it doesn't mean that all gamers are like that, and I certainly won't let videogames have that effect on me. But I'm still going to keep playing, because I enjoy it, as I have done for about 10 years. Downvote, brigade, do whatever. I don't care. But at the end of the day, I'm trying to prove a point here.	copypasta

Quarantine has been PRODUCTIVE! 4 WORKS ON WATTPAD	For over 20 years I've written works without compiling them into one place.During quarantine I've put my written works together and have now 4 works (2 complete) going on Wattpad with new works being updated DAILY as I still have tons to go through. My writing goal has always been working within my own created Universe. My writing revolves around dark fantasy and neo-noir elements that I have molded into a world that highlights the struggles between the Fallen and Divine. I am also lucky to have the very talented Vanessa Trueba [https://www.instagram.com/nessa\_ninona/](https://www.instagram.com/nessa_ninona/) lending her talents for my Revelations series with chapters from Book III finally being uploaded after a 7 year hiatus.

ContraPoints‚Äô theory of cringe - what motivates us to snark?	Natalie Wynn aka ContraPoints posted a really excellent video yesterday called [‚ÄúCringe.‚Äù](https://youtu.be/vRBsaJPkt2Q) She draws a distinction between embarrassment cringe and contemptuous cringe - essentially, cringing with someone vs cringing AT them. Watching the video I couldn‚Äôt help but think of the CC snark community, and by the end I was feeling rather morally implicated myself, and was definitely left questioning what I am doing on this sub and why I follow caroline. If you have an hour and a half to spare (and let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs quarantine baby, most of us have nothing but time), I highly recommend checking the video out. There has already been a bit of discussion on the general thread, but I really think there is so much to talk about here. I‚Äôll copy/paste a bit of what I said in the general: I also felt like a lot of what she talked about could be related to caroline and the snark community, especially her idea of ‚Äúmorbid cringe‚Äù where hate following becomes an obsession. I know watching an hour and a half video of kind of a big ask for some but I would really like to hear what people here have to say about their motivations for snarking after watching CP‚Äôs cringe vid. CP makes the case that a lot of people who hate follow a cringe figure do so because that figure reminds them of something they dislike about themselves, which she calls in group cringe. Personally I think there‚Äôs a bit of truth to that last point because I do suspect most of the people in this community are also white women. (Btw has there ever been a demographics type poll on here? There should be.) But I don‚Äôt think that can neatly explain why snarkers snark. People outside the subreddit sometimes come in and say we‚Äôre basically all just jealous of her, and although I think there‚Äôs more to it than that I also think there‚Äôs a shred of truth to that statement as well. The most common sentiment I see on here is basically ‚ÄúI work so much harder than CC but I don‚Äôt have what she has, and that‚Äôs not fair.‚Äù I feel like that comes closer to what strikes a nerve with most people on here. Even though it‚Äôs a CC snark subreddit, it‚Äôs almost about more than CC - she‚Äôs almost like an avatar for the general phenomena of unearned privilege, toxic white womanhood, failing upward, etc. So the in group cringe idea is not quite right here because I don‚Äôt think most people here are reminded of themselves by CC, but I DO think that for most of us she does hit on some sort of insecurity or frustration about our own life circumstances. But let me know what y‚Äôall think. ________ As someone pointed out in the general thread, I think for most of us our initial knee jerk response is to distance ourselves from the cringe trolls Natalie references in her video, or even from the other people on this subreddit - ‚Äúwell I haven‚Äôt done x y z so I‚Äôm not as bad as them.‚Äù But the fact of the matter is we all come together here to essentially make fun of a deeply mentally ill woman, and that‚Äôs never going to be a 100% morally righteous thing. However, unlike the trolls in CP‚Äôs video, and despite what people unfamiliar with the sub would probably think, I actually believe the people here can be trusted to have an intelligent, self aware discussion about why we are actually here and what we get out of snarking on CC. So I encourage you all to share your thoughts here. üòä	SmolBeanSnark

So I did some maths,	And I found that 1 = -1 Now hear me out, this is clearly wrong... I still think its wierd. I started by establishing two numbers: p = lim(x->inf)1/x, q = lim(x->inf)(-1/x) Both of these approach zero, which means p = q, and -p = q. Then I thought about divisions. If a = b, then a/b = 1. If (-a)=b, then a/b = -1 Which means that, p/q = 1, but p/q also = -1. Therefore 1 = -1 I originally did this because I wanted to show that p and q aren't equal, I am sure someone will point out my error, but idgaf.	teenagers

Mas eu t√¥ querendo melhorar minha pron√∫ncia nessa √°rea porque o ingl√™s americano n√£o soa bem no meu ouvido kkkk, e meu pr√≥prio sotaque torna muito dif√≠cil e for√ßado o rr (sou Maranhense e o sotaque da gente √© bem neutro com o rr, ao contr√°rio dos paulistas que tem o rr bem similar ao ingl√™s americano, e pra eles √© mais f√°cil simular esses sons). S√≥ que t√¥ tendo uma certa dificuldade de achar canais de nativos com t√≥picos aleat√≥rios no YouTube, n√£o quero s√≥ ouvir professores que falam pra gente entender e n√£o soa muito descontra√≠do e natural.

My party robbed the Blue Water Inn BLIND	Ash, Huck, Pablo, Stagla & Vala - why you gotta keep doing me like this?? Also stop reading NOW. So. My party has had a lot going on lately; a battle through the streets of Vallaki against Strahds children of the night (what music they make) and a close call with the BBEG (who the cleric thought would be a LITERAL pushover - don‚Äôt try that at home kids, Strahds opposed strength check ain‚Äôt nothing to be sneezed at) so they decided to take some R&R at the Inn after a long day... It turns out that part of that is robbing the ever loving crap out of the Martikovs. They subdued the ravens in record time, raided the hidden chest, found the secret door to the Martikov‚Äôs room, found the trapdoor, managed to figure out a stealth approach up and proceeded to rob the attic. Now I‚Äôm left unsure how to handle this. There were no witnesses, and they were smart enough to go back out the way they came in (through the stables), however they failed to remember to clean up the raven corpses, and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Unwin, Danika or the others discovers what has happened. Would the party be under immediate suspicion as the newbies in town? Would they confront the party themselves, have them be spied on to see if they are the culprits, call the town authorities (although I think they‚Äôd be loath to do that as much of that coin is tied to their secret society) or if the party gets out of town fast enough, do they just get away with it? I‚Äôm really unsure how to play this. Thank you for taking the time to read my novel, and any advice would be greatly appreciated! Tl;dr - my party robbed the inn, and now I‚Äôm unsure how this will effect the game going forward	CurseofStrahd
Stop relapsing today | Dopamine hack to stop relapsing	"You all know about exercising everything else. My issue with them is they fall under category of delayed gratification meaning? The reward from all them takes time to come. You can do all or some of these following things to get daily self-motivation if you are relapsing constantly or feel the urge to beat ine out. 1. Set the number of days for this subreddit. 2. Post an urge report, you will see your own day progress...you will get instant motivation from that. 3. Read atleast one positive article. Mind you this should be positive article. 4. Reach out to someone who have successfully completed several days. They are more than willing to help, they understand you better because they literally went through what you are going through. 5. This can by far be the most amazing hack. Set a stop watch from the time you relapsed. If you feel demotivated just look at the numbers of hours that have passed. You will get that dopamine kick reward. Although lower dose than PMO but, it will get you motivated and make you realized how far you've actually come. 6. Mantra to stop fapping. Say this to yourself when you feel the urge ""ougga bugga caveman want to touch pee pee"" picked this up somewhere in this subreddit by far the best thing yet. 7. Enjoy this process, there is no finish line, there is no winner or looser each day is a victory. Celebrate the small wins and it will soon compound to something amazing. Don't take yourself too seriously. Love yourself and your body will return the love 100 folds. Goodluck to everyone starting out. My wishes are with you. To those who relapsed, it's alright you fell down now pick yourself up and get back to it. Glory awaits us my brothers."	NoFap

Justin as a DM?	"in an amnesty TTAZZ (i think the last one, could be wrong) justin mentioned maybe dming the next campaign (but that itd likely be travis who'll be the dm, which is what ended up happening). personal opinions about previous campaigns aside, i got to wondering what a justin-led campaign would be like, because unless theres a maxfun campaign hes led, hes the only one we havent seen as a dm. i think he has a good eye for pointing out when a scenes dragging along, and he has a pretty good handle on not only his own characters (obviously with some fumbles while finding his footing, but most people do when theyre playing a new character), but also a good eye for pointing out when another character is acting ooc (clint even credits justin as helping him get a grasp on neds character, because he pointed out ned was doing something ooc), which is a really useful skill as a dm. people tend to criticise him for those aspects though, mostly because its the way he goes about it (blunt and rude). whether he's joking around or actually mocking seems to vary from person to person, and the only person who can answer that is justin. my personal thought is that theyre family, and while families can definitely hurt eachother (intentionally or not), its more likely that they know each other better than strangers on the internet would? id say whether hes joking or mocking seems to be interpreted based on peoples personal projections as well (ie with graduation i feel like hes more frustrated than usual because im frustrated with graduation itself). hes also really good at creating a wide variety of characters, from the more charismatically flamboyant tv chef taako to the reluctant ""chosen"" hero charisma vacuum duck to *pepsi liberty*, and every character inbetween. its likely that they stand out from each other because theyve never had to interact, but he has a knack for creating characters that are incredibly distinct and is able to pull them off well, and is way more focused on creating interesting characters than heroic ones. obviously this is all just speculation and the only way to know would for him to actually dm, and if hes not actually interested in being a dm then thatd probably make for a rough campaign if his heart isnt into it, but all that aside i was wondering what other peoples thoughts were? dont want to turn this into a 'justin *should* dm' thread, just a 'what would it be like *if* he did' thread"	TheAdventureZone

Short Story: Bearing The Word	‚ÄúAnd we bear the word‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd we bear the word‚Äù they replied. It was a strange sermon, actually now that Sunstret began to think about it, the chaplain‚Äôs sermons recently had taken a new tone. There wasn‚Äôt even a single mention of the Emperor in its entirety, which was highly unusual for.. ‚ÄúThe word serves you Sunstret‚Äù interrupted a voice from behind. ‚ÄúAh.. The word serves you too Marres.‚Äù Sunstret kept walking down the corridor away from the chapel, it was odd to be talking to Marres. He had been a member of the Serrated Suns, the now Gal Vorbak, and Sunstret had never thought fondly of him. Too strongly opinionated for his tastes. ‚ÄúMay I join you in training? I see you‚Äôre heading down.‚Äù He was, Sunstret wasn‚Äôt sure how, but he had started down the wrong hallway. It was too late to save face and turn back towards his quarters. ‚ÄúI am. I need to go back to basics on my hand to hand combat. It has been a weakness of mine.‚Äù ‚ÄúA weakness that can only be compared to the enemy you are facing. But It is good to know that you know your flaws.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see my flaw as something for me and I need to make sure that I am ready for my lord, my company and my emperor.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see your point, but how do you serve the emperor? The likelihood of a fist being effective against a witch is only something a son of Dorn would think. It is a very individual form of battle with little to no use to your company of brothers.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe fist has its uses but being disarmed is never something we expect, it‚Äôs something we must plan for. I find that it is the simplest form, there is no extension of my body as I become the weapon I must be.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat about training in different forms of blade? Losing one's chainblade does not mean that you can not find a new weapon. Being tactile and adaptive would be more prudent than putting one‚Äôs faith in your own faults.‚Äù Sunstret was feeling impatient and annoyed that this conversation was even occurring. As he walked into the open hall, he was glad that there was no one else to hear the drivel that was coming from the Serrated Sun. ‚ÄúMarres, you should know this, the only way we can prove ourselves to our cousins and ourselves is to own our flaws and make them our strengths.‚Äù ‚ÄúI did not think our cousins have anything to do with your weapon of choice in the sparring ring. But now that you mention them, what do you think they see as our flaws brother?‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no idea Marres, I am no Wolf, Raven nor Angel. I am a proud son of Lorgar and I have no desire to think like one of our cousins would.‚Äù ‚ÄúA good answer, not great or even useful; but I like it because it is tactile. It does not answer my question but it is clear what you believe in.‚Äù As Sunstret took his shirt off, he leant over to the nearby servitor to start preparing for hand to hand training. ‚ÄúThis is not a philosophy lesson Marres. I train to make myself a better Word Bearer. We are not the strongest legion..‚Äù he saw a sign of pain on Marres‚Äô face ‚Äúyes I said it. We were humbled by our emperor, but this is for a good reason: so that we may rebuild ourselves to be stronger than who we were.‚Äù ‚ÄúThen there is something that we both agree on.‚Äù Sunstret turned towards the training arena. If he was going to get some training done, he would have to turn away from Marres‚Äô ramblings and hope that his brother would get the hint and chastise someone who needed to be taught how to be a bearer of the word. ‚ÄúBut unfortunately, you have not seen the truth that the emperor has taught us..‚Äù ‚ÄúMarres! I have seen the truth. You know it too, we have taken the emperor as a god, when he is not.‚Äù He voiced as the servitor began its first round of training. ‚ÄúThe truth!‚Äù Marres chuckled. A pain began to draw within Sunstret‚Äôs chest. He looked down to see red on the servitor, on the ground, on him. ‚ÄúThe truth is that the false god has made us adapt, to look further than his words and see that there are different gods worthy of Lorgar‚Äôs communion. We never expected his betrayal, but you are right..‚Äù He twisted his blade, ‚Äúit is something that we must plan for. Become an extension of the word, our gods, our daemons.‚Äù Weakness started to flow from Sunstret‚Äôs failing primary heart. It started with his legs, then his fists. He was light headed and had no way to move his body. The sword that impaled him must have severed his spinal cord as well. ‚ÄúIt seems poetic then, that you are paralized by my betrayal. It is how we will make a legion worthy of bearing Lorgar‚Äôs word.‚Äù	40kFanfictions

I have the feeling BotW won't age well at all.	A new direction for the series, a beloved game of its time and innovative ideas but its sequel will be able to fix all the rough edges, build upon its foundation, has got more opportunity to focus on its content and flesh out the game-mechanics. The situation reminds me of GTA3. Such a beloved game in its time with a respectable metacritic score of 97. But when Vice City and especially San Andreas released and build upon its foundation there is no reason besides nostalgia to revisit this game. Nearly everything was done better now. Even the fans of this game realized it. Noone is talking about it anymore. I'm so hyped for BotW2. Because I see the *potential* in BotW.	truezelda

Early Entry Monday May 11, 2020	Reasons to Buy DG: ¬∑ Dollar General since it launched its IPO 12/31/2009 to today has only missed earnings twice in its ten-year stock market rise. The two earnings report days Dollar General was red but the next few days after continued its upwards trend as it absorbs the minor failures. o The two dates it missed its earnings are: 12/01/2016 and 03/14/2019 o üì∑üì∑8/30/2019 the day after earnings day Dollar General +/- by $27.88 in a day closing green near its day highs. üì∑ o üì∑üì∑03/21/2020 earnings day Dollar General +/- by $42.44 in a day closing green near its day highs.üì∑ ¬∑ MACD is trending upwards with signal lines indicating it will cross and it has a positive configuration at roughly 16.69-.18.33. ¬∑ Majority of analysts have a strong buy for short- and long-term forecasts ¬∑ Dollar General announced they will hire 50,000 more employees during the Corona Virus era to keep up with booming demand. ¬∑ Overall total volume of the options contracts is currently 3,284 as of this post. The Puts to call ratio: 1.3:1. However open interest has a call ratio of 1.02:1 signaling early entry position to ride the call train as Dollar General only increases over time and is deemed recession proof. ¬∑ Dollar General has profit margins greater than Walmart and Costco and by operating with fewer employees, overhead and selling brand named products at a cheaper rate in low income communities has helped stabilize the impacts of corona deeming it corona proof. ¬∑ DG entered an Uptrend as Momentum indicator exceeded the 0 level on May 8, 2020. Odds for DG making money is very high. ¬∑ Dollar General is a store that consists of cheaper goods than Walmart and Costco. In times of recessions or depressions, I predict the go to store will be Dollar General due to the majority of Americans being middle class to lower class with the majority of American having not even 2 months savings expenses in their accounts. ¬∑ How Does Dollar General Compare to top competitors? There isn‚Äôt even an equity summary score for how much DG is going to rise. Look at the price performance in 52 weeks. 2nd to target and no one else even coming close. PE ratio can be used to evaluate future earnings predictions and market cap. Does not count other factors and the P/E ratio is 2nd to Walmart. Dollar General is an under the radar option/stock play. With a Beta of .53, Market movements doesn‚Äôt effect it that much due to the fact this Dollar General is Corona proof. üì∑ Dollar General is not also worried about supply chain issues per CEO of Dollar General: üì∑ Some Key Stats About $DG and its industry valuation: üì∑ üì∑ Reasons Skeptics say not to buy: ¬∑ ‚Äúits at all time highs‚Äù ¬∑ ‚Äúits overbought RSI is at 82‚Äù ¬∑ ‚ÄúWhat's Dollar General?‚Äù Here‚Äôs some links and TA: The DG Uptrend Momentum Indicator: [https://twitter.com/Tickeron/status/1259071349223378945](https://twitter.com/Tickeron/status/1259071349223378945) Dollar General Margin Vs Walmart and Costco Margin [https://twitter.com/MazwoodCap/status/1258848619022647303](https://twitter.com/MazwoodCap/status/1258848619022647303) üì∑üì∑ üì∑ üì∑ TLDR: $DG is the new Walmart, the new Target craze from 2019 has shifted to the Dollar General Spaceship of 2020.

Update: 47 Year old got my first console HOLY FUCK	Here is my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/g3vmiw/47yo_got_my_first_game_console_holy_fuck/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share Wanted to let you all know I finished Jedi: Fallen Order and wow, what a fucking awesome ride! It was an emotional rollercoaster for me playing this damn game! Some things I observed: -My concern I would play it obsessively didn't pan out, I could play for 20-30 minutes and it was just so stimulating I'd have to put it down. I probably play it on average an hour to two hours a day. I used it as a reward for getting stuff done I didn't want to do like cleaning/paperwork. -Learning how to use a controllers buttons is HARD. Maddening at times! I have like so much more respect for people who play these games well. Before doing this I didn't realize how much skill is involved, the eye/ hand coordination is absolutely amazing. I've watched many videos of people playing the game online, and was baffled on how they could possibly play so well. I would often swear that my controller was defective and wasn't responding as quickly as it should be. -My dogs eventually got used to my yelling and didn't give a shit, just kept sleeping through it. - I had moments of pure joy, jumping up in my living room like a happy little kid, to moments of being a spoiled little brat who couldn't play well and wanting to literally break the controller. - These games can be really good for working on yourself emotionally. I'm a mental health therapist and can see how these games can improve people's mental health if they apply basic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques. And like any hobby, for some it can potentially be detrimental. The one thing I had to keep reminding myself is I'm new at this, it takes practice, not expecting myself to be awesome at it immediately. That really help me stay focused and enjoying the game. - Confession, I played the last two bosses in story mode. I was able to beat all the other bosses, and the first time I did it felt awesome, the second time was cool, but the third time it just got old for me playing over and over and over again the same thing. I actually didn't play for 3 days because I was loathing having to fight this boss, I just didn't want fight it over and over and over again. So I made the decision to just be easy on myself in order to enjoy the game. I thought I'd regret it, but I don't. I know with time I'll get better at playing these games and probably won't have to resort to that. But for now I'm cool with my choice. Once again want to thank you all for the previous support, I'm about to start playing Red Dead Redemption 2. Wish me luck!	xboxone

Interview Resources for Data Scientists	Hey guys, this is my first time posting on this subreddit despite following it for months. I feel like with all of the help that I have received from this subreddit, I must contribute to it as well. I figured that most of the people that are learning machine learning are doing it to get a job so what's better than giving them a list of resources which they can play around with and hopefully get a job of their dreams. Since I am a hyper-resource focused person, I believe that the resources I have curated can help you guys a lot. Resource #1: [https://www.interviewquery.com/](https://www.interviewquery.com/) . Personally, I love this website and their blog which has podcasts with real Data Scientists and interview guides for well-known companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Walmart, Nvidia. I have signed up for their free problem every week and I have gotten to know what kind of interview questions I can expect. If you are looking for a job in the future or a in kind of a job/interview crunch right now, they have all of the resources to help you succeed. Resource #2: [https://www.datasciencedreamjob.com](https://www.datasciencedreamjob.com/blog). This is actually a platform that has a course and a mentoring program which could be beneficial to students/new grads. However, if you are a software engineer or someone with a considerable background in machine learning or statistics then it is not that useful. However, I would highly recommend this to any new grad/student who is looking to gain DS skills and then use [https://www.interviewquery.com/](https://www.interviewquery.com/) for interview practice. Resource #3: [https://datascienceprep.com/](https://datascienceprep.com/) . This is actually similar to InterviewQuery, albeit a bit subpar, as they are a bit statistics/math focused so if you feel like revising those pesky probability formulas or probability distributions then this would help. With regards to their blog, I would say that it not one of the best as it focuses on obsure analyses and doesn't help with interviewing but their questions can provide value. If you are someone who has trouble with the math part of machine learning then this resource would be helpful. Resource #4: [https://www.interviewqs.com/](https://www.interviewqs.com/) . This is also a interview prep site that is quite help. It is similar to [datascienceprep.com](https://datascienceprep.com) but it also has a focus on SQL which is a major part of DS interviews. After reading hundreds of DS tutorials, I have found their blog to be a amalgamation of these standard, introductory analyses which can be jarring to a lot of people. So, if you choose this resource then please use it for Interview questions only. Personally, I feel like InterviewQuery is more helpful as it offers mentorship through it's talks/podcasts which anyone can listen to in their free time and their interviewing guides targeted to specific companies (I have linked a few of them at the bottom). Personally, I believe that learning the fundamentals is key and so if you are a student, you should probably look at CS229's lectures from Stanford on Youtube or [Fast.ai](https://Fast.ai). I believe that with rapid progress in DS, it is a viable career option but areas like Neural Architecture Search might make it infeasible in the future by designing neural networks which can design other neural nets. Scary stuff, I know! As promised, here a few company guides from Interview Query and you guys can check out the rest of them on their blog. [https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-snapchat-data-science-interview-questions-and-tips/](https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-snapchat-data-science-interview-questions-and-tips/) [https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-the-google-data-scientist-interview/](https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-the-google-data-scientist-interview/) [https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-amazon-machine-learning-interview-questions-solutions/](https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-amazon-machine-learning-interview-questions-solutions/) [https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-nvidia-data-science-interview/](https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-nvidia-data-science-interview/) If you guys have any thoughts or comments, feel free to post them as I will respond to every single one of them. I also have a few other resources and I will be happy to share them in the comments (since it is quite late and I need to get off reddit into the real world).	learnmachinelearning

What Failure Entails - Claude's Fate in Non-Verdant Wind routes	"**Spoilers for all routes in Three Houses** Since the release of the DLC, more information has come out for Claude and I think most, if not all of it, refutes a common perception of what happens to him at the end of Crimson Flower (if he is spared), Azure Moon, and Silver Snow. Therefore, today, I will be diving into an analysis about Claude's fate in non-Verdant Wind routes. I will be looking at both the English and Japanese version of Three Houses a bit because I think the Japanese dialogue can sometimes show a new perspective. For each section that look at both in, I will specify in parentheses which version of the game I am referencing. ""English"" means that is the official English localization, ""Japanese"" means that is the Japanese version, and ""Translation"" means it is a direct, unofficial translation. Translations will always be as direct as possible. They will not be fancy by extension and might even have awkward flow because it is trying to keep the nuance of the original Japanese in mind. Anyway, let us begin ‚Äì Claude's father is the King of Almyra as mentioned by several of his endings (Annette and Ingrid), but many lines suggest that Claude is not necessarily heir to the throne. Claude says that following in S-support with Byleth: >Claude (English): ""Now I've got to use my other bloodline to change my homeland for the better. *I have royal connections there too, insignificant as they may be.* It's time for me to struggle all over again and see what good I can do."" >Claude (Japanese): ""Âêë„Åì„ÅÜ„Åò„ÇÉ‰ø∫„ÇÇÁéãÊóè„ÅÆÁ´Ø„Åè„Çå„Å™„Çì„Åß„Çå„ÄÇ„Åì„ÅÆË°Ä„ÇíÂà©Áî®„Åó„ÄÅ„Åæ„ÅüË∂≥Êéª„ÅÑ„Å¶„Åø„Çã„Çà„ÄÇ"" In Japanese, I think the implications of what Claude is saying comes off stronger. He uses ""ÁéãÊóè„ÅÆÁ´Ø„Åè„Çå"" to describe his position in Almyra and this translates to ""borderline royal"" (I have seen it translated to ""insignificant part of the royal family"" as well, but I believe ""borderline royal"" is probably most direct) and it implies that he is not an important part of the Almyran royal family. A recent [Nintendo DREAM interview](https://nintendoeverything.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-interview-part-2-byleth-dimitri-eyepatch/3/) also supports that interpretation by mentioning that Claude likely has many half-siblings that hated and bullied him. In other words, while Claude is Almyran royalty and can claim the throne, I believe he is in competition with his half-siblings and he is not guaranteed to get it. In fact, the reason that Claude is able to become King of Almyra in Verdant Wind is because he accomplished something substantial ‚Äì united Fodlan ‚Äì and demonstrated strength and growth. Claude's ending card with several characters like Hilda, Annette, and Ingrid support this interpretation: >Hilda: ""Entrusting the future of Fodlan to his friends, Claude left for Almyra to take his place as heir to the throne. *His family saw that he had grown strong and allowed him to claim his birthright.*"" >Annette: ""Entrusting the future of Fodlan to his friends, Claude left for Almyra with Annette, whom he intended to marry. He announced this fact to his father, the king of Almyra, who *approved of Claude's growth* and Annette's wisdom and resolved to entrust the monarchy to them."" >Ingrid: ""Entrusting the future of Fodlan to his friends, Claude left for Almyra with Ingrid, whom he intended to marry. He announced this fact to his father, the king of Almyra, who *approved of Claude's strength* and Ingrid's virtue and resolved to entrust the monarchy to them."" In non-Verdant Wind routes, Claude returns to Almyra without achieving anything. This makes his chances of becoming King of Almyra dubious. I do not doubt that Claude will always be trying to find a way to carve out a place where he belongs, but that desire can only get him so far. This is especially so after a telling piece of dialogue in regards to Claude's fate in non-Verdant Wind routes was added in with the DLC. During chapter 15 of Crimson Flower and chapter 20 of Azure Moon, a suspicious man appears in the Abyss monastery segment. When spoken to, these are his lines of dialogue: >Suspicious Man (Japanese): ""ÂêåÁõü„ÅåËß£Êï£ÔºüÁõü‰∏ª„ÅØÂßø„ÇíÊ∂à„Åó„Åü„Å£„Å¶Ôºü‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‰ø∫„ÅÆÂΩπÁõÆ„ÇÇÁµÇ„Çè„Çä„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åì„Å®„Åã„ÄÇ„ÉÅ„ÉÉ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶„ÅÇ„ÅÆÁéãÂ≠ê„ÇÅ„ÄÇ„Åæ„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÄÅ„Åæ„ÅüÊù•„ÇãÊ©ü‰ºö„ÅØ„ÅÇ„Çã„Åã„ÇÇ„Åó„Çå„Çì„ÄÇ‰ªäÂ∫¶„ÅØÈ£õÁ´ú„Å´‰πó„Å£„Å¶„ÄÅÂ†Ç„ÄÖ„Å®„Å™„ÄÇ"" >Suspicious Man (English): ""So the Alliance is finished, is it? The leader's gone? That damn prince. Seems my role here is at an end. No matter. Should another chance present itself, I'll take a less subtle route..."" >Suspicious Man (Translated): ""The Alliance disbanded? The leader has disappeared? ...It seems my role here is already at an end. That damn prince. No matter, another opportunity might present itself. Perhaps next time I'll be more grand riding a wyvern."" This suspicious man dons [assassin class clothing](https://imgur.com/a/AOmeZbj) so it is safe to assume that he is tasked to assassinate someone. His words are quite vague in the English localization; however, in Japanese, his last sentence translates literally to ""perhaps next time I'll be more grand riding a wyvern."" As such, the Japanese dialogue makes it very clear that this assassin is Almyran since Almyra is known for its warriors that ride upon the backs of wyverns. And the fact that he views this action as ""Â†Ç„ÄÖ"" or ""grand,"" also reinforces that idea because riding a wyvern is specifically a [rite of passage](https://imgur.com/a/7oMba4O) in Almyra. In Japanese, he also clearly conveys contempt towards the ""prince"" he is talking about due to the usage of ""„ÇÅ"" right after ""ÁéãÂ≠ê."" Therefore, it is safe to deduce that he is trying to kill this prince. At this point in Azure Moon's story, Dimitri is no longer prince of Faerghus ‚Äì he became king after chapter 18 in Azure Moon. Additionally, in the context of Crimson Flower, it makes no sense for the assassin to talk about the Alliance and Claude before switching to Dimitri without some kind of bridging thought. Thus, the assassin can only be talking about Claude (since Claude is an Almyran prince). Therefore, if Claude is not killed on non-Verdant Wind routes, this NPC gives an idea of what will likely happen to him when he returns to Almyra. Claude has spoken briefly about being targeted by assassins in his B-support with Byleth and the threat of an assassin has likely always lurked in the back of his mind (how Shamir and Claude's C-support opens up leads me to believe Claude was initially scared that an assassin had followed him to Fodlan), but the mere existence of this suspicious man plays with the idea that Claude will be killed when he returns to Almyra in non-Verdant Wind routes or at the very least, show that Claude will face strife later on his life (after all, the NPC must have been added for a reason). There are a few caveats in regards to this suspicious man, however. For one, he does not appear in Silver Snow. I think this can be explained by how the developers simply copy-and-pasted Verdant Wind's Abyss monastery dialogue on to Silver Snow without second thoughts. This is reinforced by the fact that in chapter 16 of Silver Snow, Constance says ""[...] I fear that to proceed will be to abandon all hope of restoring the Imperial House of Nuvelle. Which leaves me with no choice but to appeal to you and Claude for that. My dream is in your hands"" even though Claude does not appear in Silver Snow at all. Additionally, this assassin still appears and his dialogue does not change if Claude is killed in Crimson Flower. Once again, I believe this is an oversight due to the sloppy implementation of the DLC. The assassin's first two sentences are unequivocally about Claude but they do not make sense if Claude is killed because he could not have ""disappeared."" And as established earlier, it makes no sense for the assassin to talk about Dimitri in this context in Crimson Flower. The only prince he could be talking about is Claude; however, the developers seemed to have forgotten to remove the NPC or change things if Claude was killed the chapter prior. Unless another interpretation of this dialogue can be pieced together, I believe the intent was to show that either Claude will eventually be killed upon returning to Almyra or show that he will be facing a lot of strife back in his homeland in non-Verdant Wind routes. This unfavorable fate also ties into themes that revolve around Claude as well as major flaws of his character. Claude has had his circumstances at birth constantly define him. Being born from a mother of Fodlan descent lead to him being hated for his lineage in Almyra. And entering Fodlan with no word of his existence beforehand meant being suspicious or untrustworthy. He was either treated with contempt or as an outsider before doing anything to warrant those reactions. But on the flip-side, all his connections are also born from his circumstances, namely his status. As Almyran royalty, Claude got connections to Nader, an Almyran general. And as heir to House Riegan, he has connections to Judith and his grandfather, Oswald. None of these connections are things that Claude did anything for either. Ultimately, even though Claude's background made his environment hostile towards him, he is privileged in several ways as well. Claude's privilege is a huge character flaw of his that blinds him to the suffering of others and it deserves its own thorough analysis so I will not ramble about it here; however, it is important to note that it exists because it runs in parallel with Claude's overt opposition to xenophobia. Claude wants to be accepted for who he really is and what he has achieved, not what he was born with. A guaranteed ascension to Almyra's throne would dull this thematically. But despite his dreaming, the Claude in non-Verdant Wind routes does not have what it takes to realize his lofty ambition. That is because one of Claude's key character flaws is his rationality. His rationality makes him unable to take feelings ‚Äì the feelings of other people as well as his own ‚Äì into account. In Crimson Flower and Azure Moon, Judith at the very minimum is always willing to die for Claude. But Claude does not understand why Judith will go to such lengths for him. Hilda is a much more notable example that occurs in Crimson Flower (but she can be recruited in Azure Moon so that is why she is a footnote here). In non-Verdant Wind routes, Claude is purely pragmatic. It's why he can survive Fodlan's war ‚Äì instead of pushing his chances, he backs out when the odds turn sour. But the thing is, that rationality clashes hard with his idealistic dreams. And in the end, Claude locks away his own feelings in exchange for survival. This interpretation is once again supported by the [Nintendo DREAM Interview](https://nintendoeverything.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-interview-part-2-byleth-dimitri-eyepatch/3/) which states that Claude has different values than those from Fodlan and how he believes survival is equivalent to victory. **Conclusion/TL;DR** In conclusion, the newly added DLC dialogue, the insight provided in the recent Nintendo DREAM interview, and the in-game endings and themes all suggest that Claude will *not* claim the Almyran throne in non-Verdant Wind routes. In Crimson Flower and Azure Moon, Claude's final fate is heavily implied to be a road filled with strife or even his own death. It is tougher to discern whether or not he will become King of Almyra in Silver Snow due to the absence of the DLC assassin on that route (which might have been unintentional, but nonetheless, the assassin does not exist in the route); however, with Claude's noticeable lack of accomplishments in Silver Snow, he offers little to garner his father's approval. And even if Claude is able to become King of Almyra, his shortcomings in non-Verdant Wind routes ‚Äì namely his rationality, ignorance, and reliance on using others ‚Äì will likely prevent him from finding the true acceptance he seeks. I want to end on a huge thank you to u/simplegrocery3 and u/cyrismustang for verifying and/or translating the Japanese portions I wrote about! This essay would not have been possible without their help since I am self-taught in the language and learning. u/cyrismustang has also been [translating the entirety of Three Houses's main story as a personal project](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/elhi7z/three_houses_fan_translation_prologue_personal/) so please take a look if you're interested in the differences between the English and Japanese dialogue of Three Houses. And also a huge thank you to u/Thanni44 for bringing the DLC dialogue to my attention and discussing with me!"	fireemblem
Last Roll20 session was amazing!	So ever since the pandemic started our little DnD group has moved our sessions to Roll20 and I took over as DM. I was extremely worried how it would go not being in person with our friends. I've been writing a Homebrew campaign for about 6 months and several Sundays ago we officially launched my campaign. I'm extremely proud to say that last night after hitting level 4, my players spent the entire day interacting with NPCs, exploring a port town I created, and generally just having fun and roleplaying (without complaining about no combat at all). At the end of the session one of my players said that it was an awesome session and she can't wait to play next Sunday!! I'm so happy my players like what I've worked so hard on. I know hardly anyone will see this but I had to tell someone!	DnD
How I became a cuckold	Well my story is that my girlfriend wanted to watch me suck another man's cock. She told me it made her so hot and horny to think about it. So I confessed that I've sucked a friends cock before and would be willing to please her. So we found a guy willing and was really good size and my girlfriend started to kiss him and I got turned on from it. Before I knew it I was sucking his big cock and my girlfriend loved watching and she started fucking him and I loved it. Once done I was ordered to lick her clean and I loved it so much. We did for few years with different guys	cuckoldstories

A love letter to the HP 6200 Pro (SFF)	Over the past year I've been experimenting with my home setup, including running a Dell R710. However, my favourite piece of hardware on my network by a wide margin is my HP 6200 Pro (sff). These seem to have been in wide circulation in colleges and universities, and there are a ton of them out there. Mine came with an i3 and 4GB of RAM, and I bumped it fairly cheaply to an i5 and 8GB, and I've been pretty thrilled with the performance considering the price. In Canada we have significantly less choice and we pay significantly more (for example, you frequently see the R710 for sale in the US around $100 USD, the cheapest you can find it here is around $250 CAD, and you still might have to purchase caddies). But the 6200 Pro cost me $75 CAD, it holds 3 drives easily (assuming you're willing to swap out the optical drive) and it's cheap and quiet. If you can live without the redundancy provided by enterprise grade hardware, I'd recommend these boxes wholeheartedly!	homelab

Weird phenomenon when looking at white screen, looks like a wormhole	"Probably nothing problematic but out of curiosity I'm wondering if this is an actual thing? I've tried googling but no success. Anyway sometimes when looking at a white screen on my computer all of a sudden at the center of my vision I get this weird wormwhole effect. Not sure how to describe it. The closest image I've been able to find of what it looks like is this: https://media.giphy.com/media/26ufaKwBoqwQItgic/giphy.gif But it's not still, it's moving like in the gif. And there's no color, it's just slightly dark. And there's not really a center ""dot"" like in the gif. As in, I don't see a solid black center. It's all wormhole-y to the very end."	optometry
All Umineko Characters are severely flawed and self contained tragedies/external tragedies. And Thats a good thing.	"Like how Eva grew so bitter under the shadow of being a woman - cast by not only sexism but also cast by her father. How strongly she wished things couldve been different or that she was born a man. Then she goes into life trying to ""prove herself"" and does not see that the same thing she is doing now --- her son would wish she would stop and accept him for who he is instead of trying to perfect him. And being sexist toward him as well, ""Because he is male. He will be the perfect heir."". The parents -- siblings are mostly tied in a chain of pain. ""Kinzo did this to me. Now I do it to you."" and so each sibling passes it on, eventually one way or the other poisoning everyone. Not only does each character have an ""external tragedy"" but also an ""internal tragedy"". One caused by events outside of their control --- like Eva and all the rumors of the rokkenjima massacre , but also internal conflicts they are oblivious to -- which cause them much distress. I always remember the umineko characters just because of how ""human"" they are in terms of how externally and internally flawed they are -- unlike some other typical ""modern"" anime characters. In a sense the characters remind me of Evangelion in a sense of how they could make you laugh until you realized how not all the characters together could form one ""whole person"" -- in terms of what they lacked or how fragmented they were -- and that in that is to be human, [in umineko] they arent happy in the end because they ""resolve"" these problems but more because they become aware of them and allow themselves to forgive each other and their own selves. Like how when Meta Beatrice sees Kinzo crying at the painting -- screaming for her to appear and smile at him once more. And she looks at him and says ""Kinzo, you fool. You cannot see that I am right here."" - Signaling that Kinzo's solution to his woe do not lie in some arcane ritual but in the ability to grant himself forgiveness for his sins and move forward. His tragedy is not only external, but largely internal. He wants Beatrice (and Beatrice 2.0) to forgive him, but that wouldnt matter if he cant forgive himself. Not all problems in life will be solved. But there is no need to carry that excessive burden forever. Theres no ""fix"" to a lot of the problems in the novel or a ""villain"" to defeat other than their own interal conflicts and misconceptions -- other than acceptance and forgiveness. Thats a beautiful message."	umineko

Wanted to thank some of you specifically for your help on my previous post about negativity at work.	"Posted asking for advice on how to handle negativity when returning to work. I've reflected on and incorporated what was suggested to me. I've realized that everyone is the way they are because of their own reasons (simple, right? I had never looked at it this way though), just as I am the way I am because of my own reasons. Realizing people respond the best they know how, whether that has been shaped by past experiences, big life stresses, the people they are around, whatever factors, has allowed me to listen to others more empathetically, pause to see my first internal reaction, and change how I respond to them (or not, as some suggested it can be best to just not reply or give a passive ""Mmm""). I find myself calmer and less physically tense. I respond instead of react and reframe it in my head. I've learned to reframe a lot of how I see work in general actually. This stuff is so cool, man! Anyway, I wanted to especially thank u/Phantombaz u/StealYourHotspur and u/Strawberry_Sweet. You guys told me things I really needed to hear, gave me a new perspective and tools to use. You've made things much clearer for me. There's a huge difference between how scared and walking-on-eggshells I felt around a lot of my co-workers, to how I feel more in control of myself and reactions to them, in turn feeling a *lot* more confident.

Faction-specific healing/revive particle effects?	I've noticed this a lot recently when watching some of the event twitch streams etc., but its also something that became apparent with the surge of recent content creator videos: **all healing effects are green**. For the sake of brevity - why?: * Green doesn't always align well with the factions from an immersion/art perspective * It makes for a bad distinction of friend vs. foe, especially during rezwars and/or if smoke is involved (is that an enemy resnade/healing nade?) **Proposal: Make all healing/revive particle effects faction-specific.** * this is already the case for shield bubbles (could be further emphasized for e.g. VS being more purple vs. NC), and it was done for the frag grenades * AOE heal, heal grenade/ revive nade etc. should follow the factions: red for TR, blue for NC, purple for VS * Optionally (don't know if feasible): The particle effects could follow the empire color settings the player uses instead (i.e. for those weirdos that play TR with blue friendly icons) *** Its a small QOL feature request, but I think it would add a lot for the distinction of the effects (gameplay, casting/commenting), and also add to the faction flavors. Sidenote: possibly smoke and/or flash effects could be faction-colored, too (so you know whom to thank/blame, and for smoke it may mask doritos a bit when spotted within).	Planetside

I just experienced the worst thing while hosting a catalogue party	My friend and I were hosting our first ever catalogue party through turnip exchange at my island. Things were going swimmingly, and everyone was so polite. It started going downhill when someone didn‚Äôt follow the rules I set out, and began taking everyone‚Äôs furniture without putting them down. I repeatedly typed out, ‚Äòdrop the items‚Äô but that person would not listen and began taking the free furniture and DIY‚Äôs I laid out too. My friend and I tried to block the bridge so she couldn‚Äôt leave, but this BLOODY TROLL WHIPPED HER BLOODY POLE OUT and was about to jump over the river to leave (I know, I should‚Äôve fenced the river). I quickly apologised to everyone and ended the session right there. I‚Äôm beyond angry and disappointed with what just happened. Thinking back on it now, I should‚Äôve just forced shutdown my switch or closed the game entirely. That would have probably made the game not save, and the other people could still have their furniture with them. This whole situation has just put me off and I probably won‚Äôt be hosting something like this again. This is my warning to you all. Please be careful when hosting something similar to this. If you‚Äôre using turnip exchange, maybe end the session when an unknown person that is not in queue, rocks up to your island. Another thing maybe, is to have people mention their in-game name so you know who‚Äôs travelling to your island. Please don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. I feel incredibly guilty to the three other people that got their furniture stolen. Suffice to say, I‚Äôve learnt my lesson.	ac_newhorizons
making Narwhale better	"As most people can see there are a lot of players being in teams, especially on the European server. This really doesn't matter for me. Where i care about is the contact between this people. It would be a nice idea to somehow put a chat in this game. To be more clear, a chat as in the left corner down of the screen like as in the game ""Gota.io"" . Or try something new like you can actually click on a Narwhale select ""message"" and a little chat opens where you can message the player. I have never edited a game before so i wouldn't know how to do that but it doesn't seem impossible to me. The reason of this idea is to make better contact with other players where you can actually talk with if you don't want to give them any other social media for your own safety. This will make people more interested in the game. Wich means more people will play it and more people will play it for a longer time because they are able to actually communicate. I have seen a lot of people trying to communicate with only their space for their nickname and it's not really convenient. Also i'd like a Narwhale mod to add more skins and make the space for their nickname bigger. Because with the skins, nickname + clan tag people really make them self original works of art and it's really pretty to see all this created names with their matching or not matching skins. I have done it too for sure. But to keep the players happy i'd like more time of skins. An example, in the game are 2 skins where they have worked with invisibility (showing the background). i'd really like some more of those but with other patterns. For example, a spiral, stripes, Little waves,... It's really hard to explain but the ideas aren't that bad and it will make more people interested in playing this game. Peace."	Narwhale_io

I'm not good also of using EDagons because I don't really like using them. I am more of a ground troop attacker. There are times I use air troops when funneling or as a clean up Troop. BBD's are my favorite. I don't mind if there are suggestions that you can provide here with DE troops. Most of the time I used IG, WITCH, YETI/BOWLERS. I do QC or WARDEN walk depends on the enemy base. Also, I want to push to Legend League as well but that will come later. I see a lot of videos including YETI smash/PEKKA smash at TH13 and I've been practicing them too. But I want some suggestions from you guys. Thanks	ClashOfClans

Guides to setting up a Server so play with my son and his friends.	Hello everyone, Through some googling It seems there are many ways a server can be set up for Minecraft. But I'm not clear about what is the best way and was hoping for some advice and links. &#x200B; My 10yr old son plays Minecraft with 3-4 classmates regularly on Xbox One. I played minecraft for all of 10 minutes to show him the ropes of using the controller and never looked at it again. I've been thinking I want to make a world, I'll spend a few months playing in said world to build up some skill and make some neat things, then have my son and his friends join. I would be playing from a Win 10 PC, they play via Xbox One. What is the best course of action to building a world, hosting said world and allowing his friends to join where I eat all the costs so that no subscriptions or anything are needed by the other families?

2 years of restoration	Today I realized that I started restoring in January of 2018. I have had a pretty consistent restoration practice during that time. There were a few months in that time span where I dropped the ball but as a whole it has been consistent tugging for at least 4 hours a day or more with the TLC tugger. With all my efforts, I have not reached the point of roll over yet. There is a lot more slack in my skin and I can masturbate without using lubricant, which is awesome! I did however think I would be further along by this point. I have folded in some manual methods in addition the wearing the TLC tugger just to give the skin a different stretch. Any other advice from any seasoned restorers would be much appreciated.	foreskin_restoration

Interesting uses for Exhaustion	Having watched Zee Bashews brilliant episode on Exhaustion, I've been wondering about cool, dramatic ways of using it. I was thinking if a spell caster ran out of spell slots, they might be able to continue casting, taking a level of exhaustion for each level of the spell This would be dangerous and dramatic as they slowly wear themselves down, only using spells where the stakes are high enough, fighting the lich or healing an ally What other homebrew mechanics could there be for exhaustion?

Tips on Recovering from a Binge Sesh & Associated Shame/ Disappointment?	I‚Äôve been great about sticking to calorie limits (1750) for the first time in my life. Made it to about 5 weeks, and posted on r/progresspics (my main motivation), but deleted my post with the progress I was so proud of after receiving too many sexual DMs. Since then, I‚Äôve felt very low energy (‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù), have been oversleeping and had 3 days where I massively oversnacked (with an extra 2000+ calories). Does anyone have tips for renewing hope and motivation? I was so excited to watch the numbers on my scale go down, and now it all feels so out of reach/ pointless when I can wreck it all as easily as running to the store and eating too big a bag of chips. And it sucks to not be able to share my progress. Being sexualized for normal pics of my body just makes me want to hide my body and never show off my progress again.	loseit

You would click on the gold plated event and it will bring you to the challenges for every gun, you would click on the weapon that you want in gold, and it will bring you to 25 challenges, these challenges may vary from 25 headshots, to 100 kills with no attachments.

"A thought on ""Karen"" and customer service"	"I used to be in the service industry, and it was hell on earth. I would hate, hate, HATE to ever be in it again. Customers can be really callous and cruel. Sadistic, even. But...... I have to admit, the phenomenon of getting lesser service based on who you are is also very real. If it's not, then white male privilege doesn't exist, and SJWs need to drop it already. It's well known that women get screwed in negotiations with salespeople, and people of color are treated like garbage even though they are paying the same ticket price as everyone else. So.....question. Is the ""Karen"" meme really more about rage against middle-aged women who dare to speak up for themselves? And their whiteness is the straw man? My elderly grandmother once sat in a doctor's waiting room for TWO HOURS when it was empty, because she was too afraid of annoying the snappish receptionist. This receptionist wouldn't have been so snappish with a man, and in fact, she would have proactively never let it get that far. So my dad called and complained. My grandmother was injured and to allow her to suffer when the office was empty was inexcusable. He was in another state, hundreds of miles away, but boy were they ever apologetic. Because of class dynamics, people can be awful to minimum wage workers. I know this firsthand. Likewise, service industry people don't have some magical immunity to misogyny, racism, ableism, or bigotry. How many disabled people have ordered an Uber only to be stood up at the last minute because the driver doesn't want to put a wheel chair in the trunk? How many black women have waited a ridiculous amount of time in a yarn store for service? How many middle aged women get ignored in a bar? So before we default to ""Karen"" let's leave room for the possibility that sometimes bigotry dynamics come from the service person, too."	GenderCritical

I am very patient and caring and love to hear about your day and get little pictures and drawing or colorings and crafts that you‚Äôve taken and made just for me. I am pretty strict when I need to be and have a healthy list of kinks if that‚Äôs where we end up taking it. I have had nonsexual Ddlg relationships and there is nothing wrong with that as long as we are both on the same page and understand limits. I am open to any age, race, or body type. If we connect we connect period. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I do have a type. But mostly my type is someone who I can mentally connect with and who is cute, bubbly and caring. I do have kik but we can talk on here until we are comfortable enough to move on to a different platform. Please don‚Äôt be shy and say hi I‚Äôd love to hear from you ‚ò∫Ô∏è	DDLGPersonals
Cutom QMK macropad with encoder	Hi everyone, I have used the search function, but I couldn't find a comprehensive guide on the matter. I would like to start dipping my toes in the QMK world by making a custom macropad. The first problem that I encountered is that there is some documentation for setting up qmk for a standard macro pad, but I coulnd't find much about the implementation of a rotary encoder. I mean, I see some people have done something, but I couldn't understand the process. Another thing I cannot wrap my head around is how I start from a custom layout on the qmk configurator. Layout that I have created on the online keyboard layout editor for example. I would like to start from a layout not included in the options because in the future I might use this for a custom keyboard and would like to explore the worst case right now even if not strictly necessary. Also, how should I wire the enconder into the switch matrix?	olkb

M4F - Turn your scrawny, awkward roommate (me) into your ideal hung, muscular fucktoy	"Before I lay out the scenario, let me say I'm not married to the ""roommate"" angle. I'm fine with siblings, friends, whatever. I'm just using roommate as an example. I'd be more than happy to discuss other set-ups. This prompt is a re-working of [another of my prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ctoye1/m4f_after_plenty_of_physical_selfimprovement_the/). But where that one takes place after the change, this scenario can focus on the change. ------------------------------------- You and I were friends all through high school. You had your group of friends, but I was a weird, shy, awkward nerd. I didn't have many friends, and as such, I was always eager to agree and adjust my schedule and plans to fit yours. When it came time to pick universities, you and I wound up opting to go to the same one. The dorms there were exorbitant, so to save money, you and I decided to get an apartment together. Once in college, you find yourself going through something of a dry spell. It's getting frustrating, and you're not quite sure what to do. It doesn't help that you've got very high standards and a very specific type. That's when you get your idea. I just sit in my room all day, not really doing anything. You know I've never had any luck with girls, and you know I'll do pretty much anything you say. From here, I could see this going a few ways. * You're up front with me. You tell me it's too much of a hassle finding guys, and you'd be willing to sleep with me as long as I do exactly what you say. I need to start going to the gym and lifting weights. You watch my diet very carefully. You get me some penis-enlargement pills/exercises. * You could do this in secret, perhaps with some sort of miracle drug/magic/something. I'm open to solutions. Where it goes from here, I'm open to ideas. You could use me as you please. Maybe you could pimp me out to your friends or have me put on camshows for a profit. I'd love to discuss other potential scenarios. General likes (not an exhaustive list, and not all need to be included): Big (fake?) tits, big ass, cock worship, public/semi-public/showing off, growth/transformation, exhibitionism, sharing, teasing, titfucking, slice of life, cuckolding General dislikes: Toilet stuff, blood, force/noncon, animals"	TransformationRP

Considering the large populations of people in bonds through the transatlantic slave trade, Helot population of Sparta,the captured parties of the Arabian Slave Trade, and the slaves of the Roman empire.

If i stop taking hrt for 4 month will i ruin my transition??	"Really hoping to have biological kids one day but i didn't freeze sperm when i had the chance. i want to stop taking HRT for a few months to attempt it. Im approaching 2 years in HRT at age 30. Do currently pass mostly, have developed pretty decently so far, im very active and eat well for the most part. My worry is that stopping for that long will ruin the long term effects and i wont fully develop and feminize properly once i get back on HRT. Being 30 i need every advantage i can get. Feel like i have to choose between kids and my true self. Ive heard of the ""ticking clock"" where once you start second puberty it only lasts for so long and the clock keeps ticking even if you stop hrt, so stopping for 4 months is very negative. Idk what to do atm, please share your thoughts and resources."	asktransgender

Or should production be more mindful of these issues and ensure that if there's a chance for said matchup that the elimination not be such a physical one? Is this not a massive issue? For an analogy, the UFC is forbidden to put two fighters in that are separated by too many spots in their ranking system. So the Lightweight champion can not face the 12th ranked guy, because that's putting someone in unnecessary danger when the outcome is obvious. It's not good entertainment, at that point. We saw that happen when Paul Felder was set to fight Khabib Nurmagamedov after Tony Ferguson dropped out and Paul was rejected because he was too low in the UFC's official rankings, so Al Iaquinta took the fight instead. That's not taking into account the weight classes, but there is a rule that no fighter is allowed to jump two weights classes, and there's an interesting rule at Heavyweight where the weight limit is simply less than 265 that says 40 pounds is the maximum difference for those fights. So a 215 pound Heavyweight can't fight a 265 pound Heavyweight, even though they're technically in the same weight class, the 215 would have to cut down to 205 and fight at Light Heavyweight. All in all, the nature of that elimination is part of what makes The Challenge so entertaining, but they did put someone's health at risk and I don't think that's worth the entertainment, personally. There's also something to be said for Rogan's complete disregard for Jay's wellbeing. For an example on this, we can look back to Leroy vs Cohutta doing the same elimination. Leroy did not wish to do physical harm to Cohutta, but it was still a rather one-sided afair. Not that it matters, but do you think Rogan is a decent enough human being to actually feel bad for what he did?	MtvChallenge
God Concept: Nephthys	So I was thinking about a god concept which has a true 'counter' in their kit. Obviously, there are gods that deal out reflect damage (such as Nemesis and Kuzenbo) that do a similar thing, but I'm referring to an ability that a) makes you immune to a single ability that would hit you if you had not countered, and b) has you return an actual attack those damage is proportional to the damage you would have been dealt. I wanted an ability that would truly feel like you outplayed whoever's attacking you. I then thought about how this synergises with the rest of their kit and how they can apply to the Egyptian goddess of rivers, the night and mourning, Nephthys (whose the sister-wife of Set, just as Isis is the sister-wife of Osiris). All of Geb and Nut's children are in the game besides her, so it'd be a good fit! She'll be an assassin (physical) as we haven't seen one in a while. She holds this weird staff thing that's honestly difficult to describe, but I imagine that she'll hold this as her weapon but with some sharper edges. I came up with the following kit: Passive (Changing Tides): Nephthys gain a percentage of the physical/magical power of the last god that she has hit and coverts it into physical power. (Doesn't scale off of level.) Obviously, this percentage will be different depending on whether the target is physical/magical as magical classes generally get more power. The idea of this passive is to establish Nephthys's role as a 'carry-killer' - a god that quickly turns the tables against a high-damaging god by using their power against them. (Remember the whole 'counter' theme I brought up earlier.) Ability 1 (Wave crash, cone): Nephthys uses a powerful wave to crash against an area in front of her, damaging enemies and knocking them up. Both the damage and the knockup duration decrease with the damage of the last attack dealt to Nephthys, down to a minimum amount of damage and knockup duration. This ability may seem confusing so let me clarify. This ability has a maximum amount of damage, which you deal if Nephthys hasn't taken any damage within the last, say, 4 seconds. But this ability loses damage depending on the last bit of damage dealt to Nephthys, and the amount lost is proportional to the amount of damage this last bit of damage was. The same goes for the knockup duration. What this means that, if a Nephthys is in your face, you want to quickly react by attacking her with your most damaging burst ability straight away. You don't want DOT damage against this ability, as the damage loss from this ability won't be very great. You may be able to see how this ability synergieses with this 'counter' I'm talking about. (If not, I shall explain later on!) Ability 2 (Water glide, dash): After selecting an enemy, Nephthys creates a surface of water between her and the enemy and uses it to dash towards them. She then slashes the targeted enemy with her staff. Nephthys also slashes at enemies during the dash and slows them. The damage the final slash deals increases with the number of enemy gods she attacked during his dash, up to a maximum of three. You might be able to see this is the classic 'backline dive' ability. I don't intend it to be particularly slow as I don't think interrupting this dash is the main counterplay against Nephthys (as shall be explained later). This ability is also tricky to use for mobility as you need an enemy to use it. It is more intended for an initiation tool, and the lack of disengage in this ability is made up for later on. Ability 3 (Funeral Passage, leap): Immediately after activating this ability, Nephthys assumes a stance that will block the next attack she's hit by. This stance will wear off after 2 seconds. If she is hit by an attack in this stance, she will unleash up to eight strikes on the enemy that used the attack and those around them, becoming immune for the duration. A certain amount of damage needs to be dealt to Nephthys by the blocked attack to execute the next strike. Now we get to the counter ability. As explained in the beginning, the idea of this ability is to a) become immune to the next ability that hits you after activation, and b) to deal an amount of damage that is proportional to the blocked attack. But I didn't want it to simply be an attack that has a higher damage number depending on the damage of the blocked attack - I wanted it to feel more tangible than that. This is where the whole 'up to eight strikes' comes in, where basically, the more damage you get dealt, the more attacks you get to deal back. Think of this like Fenrir's brutalise, if you were immune during Fenrir's brutalise and it could attack you up to eight times... yeah. This may seem OP at first sight, but keep in mind that Nephthys requires you to hit her with a big burst ability in order to gain maximum effectiveness with this ability. However, notice that, as a Nephthys player, this is **not** what you want in order to gain maximum effectiveness out of your first ability. This is where the crux of her whole kit comes into play. If a Nephthys is on you as the enemy (usually with her second ability), you have one of two options: 1. Don't attack her or at least use a low-damage attack like an auto. In this case, you are liable to taking a large amount of damage from her first ability but aren't at risk of the large burst damage from her counter. This decision has a low risk and a low reward (as the enemy that Nephthys is attacking). 2. Attack her with a high-damage burst ability. This is the high-risk but high-reward scenario. If you manage to hit her with the ability before she can counter, her first ability will do very little damage and be a very short knockup, and she also can't counter you unless you attack again. However, if Nephthys manages to counter you in time, you will have to bear the full brunt of her third ability and probably her first ability as well, as you would have taken so much damage at that point that you'd be running away and can't effectively nullify her first ability by dealing more damage to her. So you can see, scenario 1 allows Nephthys to benefit from her first ability and scenario 2 allows her to benefit from her third. I think this decision-making around what to do against a Nephthys not only creates interesting choices for the Nephthys player (do I counter expecting them to use a burst ability or do I use by first ability straight away instead?), but also for the enemy she's attacking (do I use a burst ability to nullify her first ability at risk of being countered by her third ability?). As a side-note, I think this ability should feel awesome once you do manage to get the right counter. In the ideal eight-attack combo scenario, she'll attack once from the left, then once from the right and then she'll jump above the enemy spin her staff above them five more times before coming down with the final slash (actually not to dissimilar to how Fenrir's brutalise works). Of course, if you don't block the maximum damage threshold with her and can only perform less than eight attacks, the animation will have to stop at the third or sixth attack, for example. Fourth ability (Spirit of Night, teleport): Nephthys teleports three times, becoming a spirit of night after the first two teleports that cannot use any attacks for 0.5 seconds. Nephthys is able to be hit during these times to cancel the ability. I think this is something unique for an assassin: an ultimate that doesn't do any damage! I thought that the rest of her kit is very 'all-in' as it stands, and needs some kind of disengage tool that she can lean to if her initial dive doesn't work out, making it appropriate here. However, this is still an ultimate ability so the cooldown means Nephthys players have to really assess the situation if they decide to go in without their ultimate. I also added some counter-play in the kit, as if you can hit her in between her teleports she's a sitting duck. I thought this was needed as it might be frustrating if a Nephthys player destroys your backline and gets away cleanly. Well there you go, that's her whole kit! There are probably a lot of problems hidden in there but I hope you get the general idea of what I intended with her kit.	Smite

21 [F4R] Canada	I‚Äôm currently a university student in Ontario in my undergrad with plans of pursuing a masters degree after. I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs open to a relationship, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable to go into something with a fixed end goal in mind. So, I would just like to get to know you and if we feel like it could be something we can talk about it. Ideally you‚Äôre close enough to meet up after. I have been single for a while, but woke up this morning missing closeness and security that comes with a relationship. I want something where we can both benefit from and continue to grow together. I love to cook, I absolutely adore trying to recreate something I‚Äôve tried while out and loved. I also love trying new recipes and taking what I‚Äôve liked from each and making the perfect version of something. Baking is usually where that happens. Cooking I‚Äôm far more loose with and sometimes it ends up incredible and others it‚Äôs just alright. I also love gardening, I love being able to eat fresh out of the garden but also see things you put effort into grow into something beautiful. I will always choose a potted rose plant over cut roses. I‚Äôm always going to take any excuse to be outside, i love staying active and want someone who does as well. I want someone who‚Äôs ready to go hiking or scale down a waterfall with me when we get a sunny day in the summer. I really like road tripping as well and picking day trips to explore different things, whether it‚Äôs the city or nature. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 if that matters. Physical attraction is also important for a relationship for me. And I‚Äôve been working out so consider it an investment, you‚Äôre only going to end up with better than you currently see üòÇ I‚Äôm looking for someone who I can joke around with and can also have more serious conversation with. I love hearing people talk about what they‚Äôre passionate about, and seeing them all excited. Ideally you are pursuing an education or you‚Äôve gotten one. I‚Äôve been finding it‚Äôs easier to talk longer term if that‚Äôs the case. Preferably you‚Äôre close in age as well. If you‚Äôre still reading, please send me a message, include your age and where you‚Äôre from. Also tell me what you‚Äôre missing the most about normal life.

[Guide] Neverland Casino Slots 2020 - Level 200 or 300	*This guide is based on the format used in multiple previous guides made by* [***u/Mikazah***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mikazah/) &#x200B; **Overview** The offer 'Neverland Casino Slots 2020' is based on an app for both Android and iOS that allows users to play slots with chips. The offer required me to reach level 300 in the app. The game is as stated in it's name, slots gameplay. This offer is quite easy to automate and you spend little time actually doing something in the app. &#x200B; Be aware there's two versions of this offer, one is to reach level 200 and one is to reach level 300. I did the 300 one and it took me roughly 72 hours, I believe it's possible to complete the level 200 one in less than 24 hours. &#x200B; Also be aware this guide is based on what I did to complete the offer, there might be other and better ways to optimize it further and I also can't guarantee this method will work for you as slots offers are somewhat random, based on what rewards you receive from cases, lucky wheels and other bonuses. And of course what you win from playing the slots will also factor in. &#x200B; **Details** |Offer name|Neverland Casino Slots 2020| |:-|:-| |Offerwalls|AdGem & AdGate Media| |OS|iOS & Android| |Countries that has the offer (that I'm aware of)|US, CA, UK, DE, SE, NO, AT, AU, ES, FR, IT, ZA, NL| |Amount|Depends on the site you use, offerwall, OS & country. **I got $15.75**| |Time Limit|12 Days on AdGem| |Time Spent|Hands on \~2 hours. \~72 Hours idle.| &#x200B; **How to play & Tips** Here's the exact recipe I suggest you follow based on my own experiences. Use an iPad/Tablet or a spare phone if possible, so you can leave it running constantly without interruption. &#x200B; The first thing to do when you jump into the game is to collect all the free chips you can, Facebook login and clicking links from their social media (didn't work for me, but I've heard others say it works for them). Also check if you've received any wCases (bottom bar) that you can open. After collecting all the free chips, start playing slots. Jump into one of the slots that offers auto-spin and don't require you to hit any button when you get free spins. Examples of these are 'Great Grizzly' and 'Temple of the Jaguar' when you get to a higher level. Also if you can, try to find out which slot has the lowest re-spin time as you want to make as many spins as possible within the least time. You're gonna want to start betting with the smallest amount possible, 10K. As you bet you will start gaining rewards, this can be anything from XP boost to wCases and chips. The start will require you to monitor your rewards for a bit. If you get wCases I suggest opening them straight away as you can hold a max of 3 at the same time. &#x200B; Once you reach level 50 you will receive a 24 hour double XP boost. This will be crucial to use moving forward as it will speed up the level process a lot. You shouldn't take very long to reach level 50 even with minimum bets. After you've received the XP boost you should check how many chips you've got and scale your bets accordingly. According to the games FAQ this will make you level up faster. &#x200B; >If you want to level up faster, there are a couple of things you can do: > >Spin more frequently, or try higher bets &#x200B; Personally I didn't see a big difference in the movement of the XP bar when doing higher or lower bets, but I'll trust their word for it. Here's how I would scale my bets, I did it in a way that I didn't have to monitor it very often, you can probably put the bets higher if you want to speed it up further, but that will require you to monitor it more often to make sure you don't lose it all. &#x200B; |0-2M Chips|10K Bets| |:-|:-| |2-5M Chips|20K Bets| |5-10M Chips|50K Bets| And you can scale it further the more chips you've got. &#x200B; Now you just let it idle for a while and check back every 10 levels maybe to see if you get any case drops & to scale up or down the bets. Also remember to check back in every hour to open the hourly case you've received. &#x200B; Once you reach level 100 you're gonna want to stay around as this will give you a medium case which can gift you plenty of chips, open it and go back to spinning. From level 101-199 the rewards are really lacking when it comes to cases and the XP bar will slow down, so you don't have to check in as often. You'll also want to check in when you reach level 200 as it gives you the best wCase for you to open. Personally I have never ran out of chips, the lowest I've been is 500k with minimum bets running, which is when I decided to try 'Journey' game mode. &#x200B; If you feel that you're about to run out of chips, go ahead and go to the 'Journey' section. This is a game mode that lets you play certain slots for a certain amount before you can move on to the next one and receive rewards between. I would jump into the slot and just spam the screen with my finger to speed up the spinning process, then I'd immediately go onto the next one when it was unlocked and collect the reward between them. Rinse and repeat, only did it for like 30\~ minutes as the rewards weren't very good unless you got lucky with a wCase. I've gotten a couple of wCases from the rewards, so if you're about to run out of chips this can be a way to get back on track. &#x200B; When you're about to sleep, just leave the app running on auto-spin with the lowest bet amount possible. When you wake up in the morning, go ahead and open the 3 cases you've received while you slept and keep spinning afterwards. &#x200B; This is all I did to personally finish the offer in 72\~ hours with a total hands-on time probably less than 2 hours. My 24 hour XP boost ran out when I had reached level 210, so I think I covered a pretty good distance. &#x200B; I'd also suggest leaving notifications on for the app, so you get notified about morning or evening bonuses you can claim. Also the 2nd day of playing you get to spin the lucky wheel twice a day, this will also be a nice bonus. The bonus wheel starts automatically when you enter the app if you're eligible for it. &#x200B; I also think it's possible to complete the offer by being completely idle after level 50 or 100. This will probably require you to do minimum bets or close to minimum and it will take a bit longer. &#x200B; **How to get more chips** * You get a free case every hour that can get you more chips. * Connect your Facebook to get 1M chips. (Might not be necessary) * Open cases you get from leveling up. * Enable notifications so you can get the free lucky wheel spins twice everyday. * Play the 'Journey' game mode and collect rewards. * Their social media has tons of links you can click to get more chips (Didn't work for me, they just take me to the developers home page, but worked for some people apparently), just scroll down a bit and you'll get to the posts. &#x200B; **Should you spend real money?** With the amount of free chips out there to grab, I don't think it's necessary to spend real money. &#x200B; **Can I speed it up further?** Yes, the more you bet, the more XP you get (According to their FAQ). I went the safe route and maximized the amount of XP I got from my chips without taking too much risk. If you increase the total bet you will get XP quicker, but you might also need more chips in-case you go on a losing streak and lose it all. Safest is what I recommend, but feel free to test collecting all kinds of rewards and starting of on a higher bet amount. It's also entirely possible that I missed out on certain features in the app or didn't find other ways to earn more chips. &#x200B; Any feedback or thoughts on the guide? Any additional things I should include?	beermoney

Guys jerk off in front of me on public transport and cause of anxiety I don't know what to do.	"This has happened for a few years now, the issue is it's not often enough where I'm no longer phased, it normally happens maybe once every 4 to 6 months and its almost always on an empty bus. I would sit in the front near the bus driver and then a guy across from me will sit on the other side not next to me (thank goodness) But right in front so I can see. Or I will be alone in a train car and a guy will sit in front of me or diagonal of me. &#x200B; I have a knife that's cover is a rape whistle in my backpack but I have really bad anxiety I dont drive and I dont have a car. I live in NYC so public transport is super important. &#x200B; If you ladies and gents can offer some advice for me id appreciate it. &#x200B; Cause (to me im not pretty or anything I normally wear oversized hoodies, jeans and sneakers) I have heard people say I should be ""Flattered"" because it means someone thinks I'm pretty when im not....

Many questions about stealth	1. Generally, are you better hidden ***in*** the bush or ***behind*** it? 2. Does changing the sight of hostiles via Infinite Heaven also affect hiding in a bush, or does it only affect the general sight while you don't have cover? 3. Is the stealth realistic in a sense that you are harder to detect when you minimize your size of appearance when being prone? (Lets say you want to go past an enemy, but have little room to maneuver - Is it smarter to move sideways while facing the enemy so you appear smaller to them, or would it be the same as crawling past them in a way that your side faces them?) 4. Does sideways rolling while prone make you harder to spot? 5. Do hostile conversations and animations (smoking, coughing, yawning, putting their gun over shoulder) decrease their sight temporarily? 6. Can you hide yourself behind another hostile? 7. Far Cry 2 user manual said that you are harder to detect when enemies are facing the sun. Does TPP also have some similar feature? Or is cloudy better for stealth than sunny? (8).

I looked up a British Youtuber who was busted for sexually coercing/abusing/harassing multiple underage girls a few years ago...	"And he holds a job as a recruitment consultant now. It got me thinking about how men are able to bounce back from their ""indiscretions"", no matter how grave, without so much as a peep from anyone, despite the fact that this guy was on record for having coerced and harassed multiple girls (some as young as 14) into doing sexually inappropriate things when he was a grown man in his 20s. Searching his name alongside his old YouTube handle brings up multiple posts on Tumblr (for some reason, that was the preferred platform for expos√©s back in the day). And yet this guy has faced zero tangible, real world consequences for messing with the lives of these girls/children. He simply deleted his online presence and got himself a job *the same year he was outed*. It's incredible what they get away with."	GenderCritical

KENIMEX SCORPION NELSON BORE GUNS AND PARTS	Hi everyone. This is my first post ever so please bare with me. I'm looking for some advice and knowledge of a big box of paintball guns and parts I came across when I was doing a demolition project that must have been stored away for 20 years plus.... After a little research they are Kenimex Scorpion Nelson bore style I believe from the 90's. I have 7 complete guns made up plus lots of brand new parts like powertubes, bolts etc. I will find how I can upload photos to here to show... I've read somewhere that these parts may or may not be compatible with other Nelson bore style guns but not sure.... All the parts are unused and amazes me how someone could just leave them sat there. Luckily they were properly sealed in bags... I will upload photos..... hopefully Anyone who knows anyone who may be interested in buying these off me or just some advice as to what I have and where I can sell them would be much appreciated. If anyone could possibly tell me how to upload photos it would be great	paintball
I can write the best during my bad spells	I don‚Äôt have food poisoning I have a poisoning in my brain A type of poison that makes everything dark The type of dark you spend all of your days trying to escape This poison, it seeps through my veins Into my blood stream, all the way to my heart It is dangerous you see, because it is accompanied by these voices These voices spend all day and all night telling me how worthless I am They tell me the world would be a better place without me in it They tell me how bad I am for those I love the most They are able to make me truly believe all of the words they are saying This poison, it not only talks to me, but it takes something from me too It takes all of my energy, leaving me to spend most days isolated in bed It takes all of my hope, leaving me to believe better days will never come It takes my sanity, leaving me to go crazy It takes pieces of my heart, leaving me convinced that not even love can save me.

A mini rant with some cussing and mentions of certain political topics	Okay, so if you‚Äôre offended by cussing and/or someone venting about conservative, anti-sex people, please just leave now. I‚Äôm. So. Fucking. Tired. Of. Conservative. People. Especially. The. Anti-Abortion. Ones. Because they always fucking say,‚ÄùKeep your legs closed!‚Äù They‚Äôre just anti-sex. And men fucking everyone in town is perfectly goddamn fine, but a woman enjoys having a cock in her pussy? OH NO, THAT‚ÄôS DIRTY AND WRONG! People who are lucky and blessed enough to enjoy sex and penetration don‚Äôt fucking understand. Men don‚Äôt fucking understand and seem to have a fetish for shaming women for enjoying fucking even though they enjoy it too. Women who are lucky enough to just fuck with no foreplay and their partner can thrust at the speed of light to satisfy himself while not causing her agony don‚Äôt fucking understand. Nobody understands what it‚Äôs like to not even be able to experience sexual pleasure/an orgasm. Maybe I‚Äôm just selfish. I don‚Äôt know. I think jealousy is love and hate blended together. Love because I see a movie scene where with virtually no foreplay the woman can allow her partner to screw her at the speed of light without being in agony and I think to myself,‚ÄùI wish I could BE that/like that.‚Äù Hate because I see that and think to myself,‚ÄùWhy can‚Äôt I be like that? Why does everyone else get to enjoy this so much, and I‚Äôm so defective that I can‚Äôt?‚Äù Anyways the movie is Shape of Water and you guys can tell me what you thought of it. Did you think the man was moving quickly? I‚Äôm sorry if I upset someone. I‚Äôm just pissed off and down.	vaginismus

2 years of restoration	Today I realized that I started restoring in January of 2018. I have had a pretty consistent restoration practice during that time. There were a few months in that time span where I dropped the ball but as a whole it has been consistent tugging for at least 4 hours a day or more with the TLC tugger. With all my efforts, I have not reached the point of roll over yet. There is a lot more slack in my skin and I can masturbate without using lubricant, which is awesome! I did however think I would be further along by this point. I have folded in some manual methods in addition the wearing the TLC tugger just to give the skin a different stretch. Any other advice from any seasoned restorers would be much appreciated.	foreskin_restoration
Question: Should Heidi N Closet change her drag name?	I mean, it became a running joke this season, but Heidi Aphrodite has a nice ring to it.

Which name would you like to see her use (either one already mentioned on the show or a new one)?	rupaulsdragrace

The Last Dance is the best documentary ever made.	"The music first of, is Hans Zimmer level of epic. The story telling is top notch and the revelations, even after 20 years later is still shocking. MJ, despite being the consummate ahole that he was back then, never changed my outlook that he is and forever will be the greatest to ever play the game. I'm still watching Episode 8 but I already think that this docu by far, is the best thing to hit television since the sixth season of Game of Thrones. Change my mind, otherwise. I would love to know that there's another existing show that could beat this in terms of quality and content. Edit: All right looks like I'm watching ""Hoop Dreams"" next so I can have some fair comparisons. Edit 2: You've proven once again that you can't be beaten. I'll look into your suggestions hoping it's not a waste of time."	nba
Quit smoking and bought a Venu with the money I've saved - I love it.	First I got the vivoactive 4s. It was great but too small. I sold it to my girlfriend and got vivoactive 4.

I use it for tracking my health and mental health, running, playing football and doing other cardio. Sleep algorythm could be better, but I'd say it has been pretty accurate for me.

Royals Delivers what players enjoy the most...	"Think about it... I'm playing this game for a long time, over 1000 hours in.. one of the best parts in the game happened when raids become a mess... you know, mechanoid raids with human raids and insects all at once, fighting. or manhunter pack and a siege, manhunter packs and traders.. this kinda stuff... I can also say that other people like this type of content, because of reddit upvotes... Prints of this situations got a good attention in this community, with people asking ""So, what happened? Who win?"" &#x200B; Now lets talk about Royals DLC... this DLC delivers exactly that, and I'm pretty sure this is on purpose... &#x200B; We have monuments that when they are destroyed what happens? Raids, manhunter packs, Etc. &#x200B; We have mechanoid clusters, that stay on the map, and attack raiders, manhunter animals, etc. &#x200B; We have quests that delivers a raid/insect hive/ manhunter pack in a few hours when you accept, and you sometimes have a good amount of time to accept it... &#x200B; All of this, in the last few weeks playing with this DLC, makes the game so fun... a lot of times was able to make the ""messy situation"" happen... just last night, i destroyed a block of a monument activating a 22 manhunter lynxes to destroy a new mechanoid cluster.... And the point i am making here is: i do think this is on purpose.. &#x200B; So yeah.. i just want to throw this out... What do you think? PS: English is not my primary language.. :)"	RimWorld

[HUGE spoilers for season 1] a summary of season 1's main events. [like seriously, this spoils everything, go watch the show if you haven't already]	"so [u/KaylieKonrad](https://www.reddit.com/user/KaylieKonrad/) posted wanting a recap of season 1 as it's been a while. I was originally going to comment on there, but it turned out to be so long I thought some other people could make some use of it, seeing that season 2 just got released a couple days ago. i'm assuming you know the basic storyline, three teens wake up in a room unsure of who or where they are, they solve puzzles and get out of bad situations all whilst trying to get home, theorising on where they are and get help from an omniscient and omnipotent god. so let's get deeper than just a very brief summary: the three main characters, Adam, Mira and Kai wake up in a bunker and solve a puzzle to get out, their main goal from the beginning is to get home and not die along the way, while theorising on where they are and why they're in this strange world. along the way, they meet this strange guy who can help them get out of situations and shed light on where they are, in a cryptic kinda way. they each discover that they have superpowers, Adam has super strength, Kai can control fire and knows a lot about mechanics and electronics, and Mira can breathe underwater, swim extremely well and speak to animals. after they make bonds, discover their powers, become comfortable in the world and make sense of things, they start to adjust and focus their energy on getting home. after falling through a portal the strange guy put there, they meet a talking tree who is missing a branch. the tree tells them that if they can get the branch back from some devil monks, she can take them home. the branch, as it turns out, is an insanely powerful weapon called the Ishibo. they manage to retrieve it from the monks after their leader falls to his death, but another group of three teens (ill call them group 2) who also have superpowers show up and steal it, making a quick getaway. After finding which direction group 2 went in, they find themselves in a western town, where they meet group 2, and this time have a civil discussion with them. group 2 is made up of Vanessa, Skeet and Reeve, who have powers of flight, speed and telekinesis respectively. Vanessa charms Kai into teaming up with group 2, but Adam and Mira aren't so trusting. Skeet and Reeve tell the trio that they lost the Ishibo, and the plan for the groups is to team up and retrieve the Ishibo, find the tree and go home together. However, Adam and Mira fall into a network of tunnels after getting ambushed by zombies, leaving Kai with group 2 and nowhere else to go. we follow Adam and Mira in the underground tunnels, and they meet a blind old man called Dave who guides them through the catacombs, he basically tells them to go find an ice castle and retrieve the Ishibo. when they get out of the tunnels, Adam sees Dave glitch in a way, he flickers, and Adam is rightfully spooked. He proposes a theory that they're in a videogame and that they need to ""win"" to go home. they get yeeted by the talking tree because they dont have the Ishibo and end up at the ice palace, where they see that group 2 and Kai are frozen in blocks of ice, with the Ishibo frozen with them. Kai escapes the ice using his firepower, and Adam tells Kai to melt the Ishibo out of the ice, but not group 2. Kai refuses as he has trust in group 2, and unfreezes them. group 2 betray them and attack Adam with the Ishibo, fatally wounding him. Vanessa insults Kai greatly and he is visibly hurt by this. they escape the ice castle and end up on the shores of a human-spider infested island. Adam is unconscious gets kidnapped along with Kai and Mira. Kai also used the last of their help from the weird guy.just before they got kidnapped, the weird guy shows up after a glitching spaceship crashes out of the sky, and tells them that the game is hella glitchy and they need to get out as soon as possible. Kai and Mira are taken to see the king spider centaur type thing, and he says he doesn't trust humans after group 2 cut off two of his legs. Kai fixes his legs, the spider heals Adam, and the trio is back on track. They ambush group 2, retrieve the Ishibo and head to the talking tree. She opens up a gateway for them, and the game is super glitchy at this point. they go to the final level, fight a dragon, jump through the portal, press a button and win the game. i tried to summarise the things that were only crucial to the storyline, i'll have missed riddles and foreshadowing for this reason, but if there's anything important i've managed to skip, please let me know. tl:dr - i honestly cant summarise the show much more than this, sorry folks"	TheHollowNetflix

Intensity = Truth	"**Intensity = Truth** Something I do that deviates from the Neville's teachings is in the category of undesirable thoughts. I know in the topic of manifesting, undesirable thoughts are considered a no no. I understand completely why you would not want to think an undesirable thought. However, we must be honest with ourselves. There are thoughts in our minds that repeat themselves and at times we feel intense about them. Even when we try to think a different thought, the feelings of the undesirable thought linger on and makes it difficult to feel the desirable thought fully. I know in Neville's teachings, the way around this would be through understanding. Understand that you are withholding yourself in a State. You have the freedom to move into different States with no consequences. Give yourself this freedom and you will feel elated. This works for me. However... There are thoughts that are so stubborn and they feel so intense that sometimes understanding is not enough. For thoughts that seems to have lasting effects throughout the day, and causes you to feel down, worried, fearful, I do something, that at first may seem counterproductive. This is what I do: When I notice a thought that I deem ""undesirable,"" and this thought is giving me intense negative feelings such as fear, making my gut sink, worry and I simply cannot shake it off (This is only for stubborn thoughts, not ones that you can easy turn away from), I do this: >1. I identify the exact thought that is making me feel fear. > >2. I think of this thought deeply and why it is giving me fear. > >3. I keep repeating this thought on a loop and on each repeat I react to it less and less. > >4. Eventually you will come to a point where you are no longer reacting to the thought. Now after I do this. I go to the desirable thought I want to think. And this is what I do: >1. Think about the understand that you are simply withholding a State from yourself. Then think of the desirable thought. > >2. I feel the thought being fulfilled. > >3. I repeat this thought (visualize or speak) with feeling over and over. With each repetition, I feel it more intensely. > >4. I do this, like a rhythm, until all I feel and think are blissful thoughts and feelings. So, what exactly is being done here? With reacting less and less to the undesirable thought, you are taking away its power. The ONLY power it has, is in your reaction to it. With not reacting to it, it will no longer bother you. Then you cannot stop there. Stopping there will leave you feel neutral, which is not bad, but use this time to feel after your desire being fulfilled. With each repetition of feeling intensely about a desirable thought, you are fusing or identifying with that thought. From doing this with those stubborn thoughts, you will find that they will no longer bother you. You will also notice your mind will think, naturally, about the desirable thoughts because you feel intensely about them. Remember, your mind thinks truth is intensity. To the mind: Intensity = Truth As I said, this is my own method with stubborn thoughts. We all have a few, but I found this method to work. Hope it works for you as well."	EdwardArtSupplyHands

"The site ""Cum On Printed Pics"""	"I posted about this site a little over a week ago to r/antipornography, but I figured posting it here will help get more people to realize what is going on. For those who may not already know about it, ""Cum On Printed Pics"" is a site where men post photos of women and request others to ejaculate onto the photos, or do it themselves and post the result. Yup. Disgusting. Most of the photos are clearly taken without consent from social media profiles and posted onto the site. Posters say tons of terrible things about the women in the photos, calling them pretty much every name in the book and saying in quite disturbing detail what they would do to them. If that wasn't disturbing enough, there is a ton of underage content posted on the site and the admin/mods don't seem to give a damn. I've reported the site a few times before, and some people over in r/antipornography did the same after I notified them about the site, but nothing has been done and I feel like more people need to know about it until it can finally be shut down."

Expanding an arthurian inspired region: The Gales	Hello, I'm taking a a small break from being a DM so I can work on my setting. The region called the Gales is a land inspired by the fairy tales of knight culture. To catch you up on the current situation. A group of knights had commited a coup against their kings, thinking the land would be better with them in charge. The knights make a council called the round table and established their own choices of knight royalty.(Note this isn't the goverment, think of something like the Lord's Alliance) When my PCs last played in my setting they witnessed the death of the knights leader and they inspired his apprentice to try to take control. I don't know how this will end , but I'm skipping 20 years into the future where I've tried fleshing them out more. I need to decide whats happened, but here's some current realms in the Gales. Kingdom of SunRest- Probably one of the oldest and largest of the kingdoms. Sunrest represents the glory of knighthood and constantly compete in tournies & large public events. Kingdom of Grailord- A land that was once full of hate and fighting, the kingdom was ripped into two dutchies for nearly a century before eventually repentance was made (might need help figuring out why) and the kingdom of Grailord is now a place known for it's comrodiry and kindhearted knights. Grailord represents the compassionate heart of knighthood Kingdom of Cashmere- A realm noted for its grimmer athmospere, this kingdom is on the frontline of a major war and it shows. The people aren't upset about tbis though, knights will gladly go out to eat because the greatest thing a knight can do is sacrafice themselves for the greater good. This kingdom represents a knights sacrafice and you can see it in their culture. Kingdom of Elden- The mountainy region of Alden has long been known for it's libraries of profuse knowledge and now it's also known for it's arcane academy, (I'd appreciate any help on making an interesting wizard school). It's well known for it's arcane knights and flying mounts that are conteolled with enchantment. Alden represents a knightly mind of teshnique and strategy. (Weak I know) Kingdom of Umbrin- A northern kingdom that was once nothing more then another barbarian tribe, but since then they've been accepted by their most knight for their bravery. They're usually fighting barbarian clans and other tribals, but recently the biggest problem is the tar dragon on black mountain and it's growing cult. Umbrin represent a knights bravery against all odds. Kingdom of Aurora- The neighbor of Umbrin, it's also the opposite. The knights here represent the monk class more then fighter, paladins or cleric. Castles work as monastaries and they believe in non-lethal take downs. (I'd like some help expanding this one out a bit.) The Dutchty of Gawain- A small realm located in the heart of Sunrest, Gawain is an realm given to an elven knight for his sacrafice in service of the coup. The land is magical and is legendes to be blessed by an ancient being. Gawain is still carving itself a place in the Gales. Thats all I have now, but I do have an open space left in the region. Its big enough for either 1 kingdom, 2 Principalities or 4 dutchies. I don't really know what to place there and i thought I'd ask you all. Any input will be appreciated. TLDR: just read it, sorry	DMAcademy
My party robbed the Blue Water Inn BLIND	Ash, Huck, Pablo, Stagla & Vala - why you gotta keep doing me like this?? Also stop reading NOW. So. My party has had a lot going on lately; a battle through the streets of Vallaki against Strahds children of the night (what music they make) and a close call with the BBEG (who the cleric thought would be a LITERAL pushover - don‚Äôt try that at home kids, Strahds opposed strength check ain‚Äôt nothing to be sneezed at) so they decided to take some R&R at the Inn after a long day... It turns out that part of that is robbing the ever loving crap out of the Martikovs. They subdued the ravens in record time, raided the hidden chest, found the secret door to the Martikov‚Äôs room, found the trapdoor, managed to figure out a stealth approach up and proceeded to rob the attic. Now I‚Äôm left unsure how to handle this. There were no witnesses, and they were smart enough to go back out the way they came in (through the stables), however they failed to remember to clean up the raven corpses, and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Unwin, Danika or the others discovers what has happened. Would the party be under immediate suspicion as the newbies in town? Would they confront the party themselves, have them be spied on to see if they are the culprits, call the town authorities (although I think they‚Äôd be loath to do that as much of that coin is tied to their secret society) or if the party gets out of town fast enough, do they just get away with it? I‚Äôm really unsure how to play this. Thank you for taking the time to read my novel, and any advice would be greatly appreciated! Tl;dr - my party robbed the inn, and now I‚Äôm unsure how this will effect the game going forward	CurseofStrahd

Lucid Sex + Flying + False Awakening	"After a serie of vivid dreams, my alarm rang. And instead of doing a technique, I just went back sleeping because I was lazy. I had a 2 long dreams before being lucid, then I found myself in my bed in darkness. I thought I was awake but I said whatever let's just do a reality check... I plugged my nose and I could breathe through it. I ""woke up"" in my old house, in my room. Then I started rubbing my hands cause my dream was fading away. Then I explored and as I was out of my house, chilling on my terrace, I told myself when I enter my house again, there will be the finest girl from ""Gooba"", you know that 6ix9ine new music vid. I went in and she was there, in my living room. You all know what I did next. No one really talks about these sex experiences, but every frequent lucid dreamer (which I'm not) had them. Well, anyway the sex didn't really seem real except for the orgasm which was so great, and in the morning, I had the sperm in my pants. Next thing I did was leave my house. I wanted to fly but I had never done it before. I also wanted to talk to my subconscious by interacting with dream characters, but no one was there. So I decided to fly. And I had it first try. I jumped, then I flew off. It was so incredible. I could see my native island. It was the same, until there was a part that my mind created. It was a Savannah. Without really controling it, I landed there. There were lots of elephants and other animals. Seconds after I landed, a Lion was trying to attack me. He was dangerously close to me. I took off just before it had me and was so amazed at all I had experienced Last thing that happened was my dad waking me up. He's not even in the same country I am but it didn't seem to surprise me. I was upset and told him he ruined my lucid dream. He told me I had things to do and he couldn't wait for me to wake up. Then, I woke up for good and still was upset, but this time for not realising I was still in a dream. Do a reality check everytime you wake up, this won't happen to you. Ps: During this dream, I had this problem with my eyes. Sometimes I could open both, but most of it, only my right eye was barely opened. It made my vision blurry, no matter how much I stabilized the dream. I still had a great time. But if someone knows anything about this, let me know thanks !"	LucidDreaming
Season 5 - Leslie	Re-watching season 5 of Masterchef and why is everyone so mean to Leslie? Honestly, he seems fine, or at least not as bad as everyone makes him out to be. In fact, there are a lot of much meaner people in this season (like Courtney and maybe even Daniel). I think his hate is unwarranted and that a lot of the things he got hate for (like when he got frustrated with Ahran during the wedding team challenge) were somewhat reasonable. Like how she did already unfairly judge him and was unhappy being on his team prior to the start. And also, the fact that Willie likes him must mean something. He was the nicest guy on the show and everyone loved him so his judgement of people must be reliable.	Masterchef

Mothers Day Gone Wrong	Second try, First was removed for naming the restaurant, which I did not do. I suspect it was removed because I mentioned I might have to go to \[Rest aurant Na me Here\] as a backup..... My wife wanted a special dinner for Mothers Day. So we called a local Italian restaurant. Its small place (\~12 tables) and the owner is there every night. Its very good food, rather expensive but worth it. Thinking it might be busy (its always busy) we called to place a pickup order at 4:45pm. I found out my food order would not be ready until 7:30pm! Yikes, thats later than we had planned but we went with it. Later dinner is fine. I arrive at 7:30pm and immediately see 20 people (some standing, some in cars) outside of the restaurant. Aw crap. Knowing each person is representing a single table, there enough people standing around that they would have to turn their restaurant twice to clear all those people. I call them and ask what the protocol is, do I get out and stand in line? Do I call back? Do they call me? She says they will call me. Ok. 8:10pm I have been sitting in my car for 40 minutes playing a mobile game. I call back. How is my order doing? I am told 30 more minutes. Ok. Its 8:10pm now, unless we switch to \[Rest aurant Na me Here\] for dinner I am out of options already. 8:40pm I call back but cant get anyone on the phone. I move to standing in front of the restaurant. I start chatting with some other customers. I hear there is tons of food sitting in bags inside of the restaurant. From all of the people who ordered food but didnt end up waiting. I must see this, so I move inside. Lots of people waiting inside too. I see probably 20 orders in bags sitting there. The tickets are next to the bags and the tickets all have the pickup times on them. All of the tickets I see have pickup times of 5:30pm-6:30pm (mind you it is now 8:40pm). I encounter two other people waiting that have pickup times of 6:30pm. I am not sure if that makes me feel better or worse. 9:15pm I have watched several people just leave without food. I have seen several people walk into the kitchen and tell them to cancel their order. At this point I heard someone say to cancel their order that had a 9:00pm pick up time. Holy Smokes! they took orders with pick ups out to 9:00pm? They havent even got food to some people with 6:30pm pickup times! They are going to be here making food until midnight! 9:45pm The owner comes out from the kitchen to apologize to the people still waiting. (about 8-10 people I suppose) 10:00pm I got my food! and a $40 gift certificate. Unfortunately my wife was asleep when I got home. So this food is lunch today I guess. My Thoughts: I have no idea why they allowed so many orders to be placed. Perhaps they thought they could make a lot of money. But judging by the number of orders that were unclaimed I am not sure how profitable of a night it was. And they pissed off a lot of their customers.	TalesFromTheCustomer

How the Death Cleric Outsmarted the DM to Save the Newbie Paladin.	This story takes place at the game store I am playing at. I am fairly new to D&D having only played for two months, but am familiar with D&D's overall mechanics due to podcasts and streams. This knowledge helped me outsmart my DM in the tale to come. In this game of Descent into Avernus, I am playing a Firbolg Death Cleric of Kelemvor and the newest player is playing an Aarakocra Paladin. The new player often irritated the party by acting like the protagonist, smiting first and asking questions later, using all of the artificer's buffs to get 21 AC, and wanting to allocate party funds towards a full set of enchanted plate armor for himself. Note, the party was level three at this point. His holy Paladin also did not like me because I was a Death Cleric. Yet, he always seemed to ask for my healing. In his defense, the Paladin had never played D&D before and approached it like fantasy games he had played-Skyrim and Dark Souls. Up to this point in the story, the Paladin had managed to kill and smite his way through the campaign which boosted his confidence and dominant playstyle. So when our party had emerged from a dungeon with our chests of loot to encounter an ambush from cultists of Tiamat, the Paladin had no fear. Our Warforged died outright in this encounter, and the Paladin said he could just roll a new character. Imagine the Paladin's surprise when at the end of the encounter the last two cultists manage to put him on Death Saving Throws (For those who do not know, if a player is put on Death Saving Throws they must roll three successes to stabilize to 0 hp. Three failures is death. Rolling a ten or higher is a success, and nine or lower is a fail. If a player stabilizes, all Death Saving Throws are reset. However, if the dying player is attacked at any point, the attack is an automatic hit. Each attack counts for two failed saving throws. This knowledge is important for later on.) The cultists demanded we give them the chests and let them escape lest they kill the Paladin. None of the party or the DM really cared if the Paladin died especially since he could re-roll a new character, just like he told our Warforged to do a few rounds ago. Having the Paladin die would also allow the party to no longer allocate funds towards that enchanted full set of plate armor he wanted. However, I could see the Paladin becoming visibly upset at losing his character so I chose to parley with the DM. For context, cultist 1 is holding the Paladin at knife point, and cultist 2 is demanding the chests. DM: The cultists have two held actions on the Paladin if anyone attacks. Me: I give my chest to cultist 2. The party is taken aback and start to bicker amongst themselves. DM: Paladin roll your Death Saving Throw. It's a 19, success. Sorcerer: I fire bolt cutlist 1. DM: It hits, and she looks bloodied but doesn't die. Paladin, a knife sinks into your chest. You fail two death saving throws. I am mentally cursing at my sorcerer. His attack was well intentioned, but it was ruining my plan. Me: Everyone, give your chests to them. Most of the party argues and grumbles before dragging the hard earned loot to cultist 2. DM: Paladin, roll. 11, another success. Cultist 2: Thank you. Now would kindly back up to the entrance from where you came. The party begrudgingly trudges back to the entrance. DM: Paladin, roll. 11, the final success. DM: Paladin you are no longer dying but are still unconscious. At this point, my first plan had worked. I had bought enough time for the Paladin to roll his saving throws. He thankfully succeeded in all of them, despite the two automatic failures from the firebolt attack. Now, there are still two held attacks against the unconscious, but no longer dying, Paladin. Phase two of my plan begins. Cultist 2 picks up two of the four chests; and the DM appearing smug, looks expectantly at the party. Me: I let him round the corner. The party and DM stared in disbelief trying to figure out what I was doing. Me: Cultist 2 has used his action to pick up the chests and used his movement to round the corner, correct? DM: Yes‚Ä¶ Me: I cast chill touch at cultist 1. DM: The cultist sees your attack incoming and stabs your Paladin who‚Ä¶ There was a long pause before the DM‚Äôs face fell as he realized my plan and his mistake. I had bought enough time for the Paladin to stabilize, let cultist two‚Äôs held action to be used to carry the chests; and with the Paladin re-stabilized, he could tank one more stabbing and only be down two of his three failed Death Saving Throws. Me: I rolled an 18 to hit with 7 for damage. Cultist 1‚Äôs body crumpled in a heap, as our Life Cleric rushed to heal Paladin. The rest of the party pursued cultist 2; and after a small chase scene, the party killed the last cultist, reclaiming our chests of loot. As an update, it has been a few sessions since this encounter, and the Paladin has chilled out a bit more by working as a team member and less like a protagonist. I mean, after having his holy Paladin being saved by the Death Cleric he disdained, his 21 AC confidence got knocked down to a more tolerable level. &#x200B; by Pond .	AllThingsDND
It‚Äôs getting hard	It‚Äôs getting really hard to believe that God loves me. I was 100% healthy my whole life. Then in 2016 everything changed and it just keeps getting worse and worse. I‚Äôve had health anxiety my whole life but I had it under control for the most part. In 2016 my mom has a stroke. She recovered fine and didn‚Äôt have any lingering effects, thank God. At the same time I had an abnormal pap which turned out to be ok and I‚Äôve had normal ones ever since. Then in 2017 I had a lump in my breast which also turned out to be nothing serious... then 2018 hit and I took my mom to the ER because we thought she was having another stroke. She tuned out to be ok again. I had some weird inverted ear drum thing which made it hard to hear but it eventually went away. At the same time my sister moved far away and a lady at work died.. then I started getting pressure in my head and I felt dizzy from it all the time... in July 2019 I ended up going to the doctor for the head pressure thing and she said it was tension headaches... so I have been dealing with that ever since. Back in October 2019 I had gotten 2 dry red patches of skin on my legs... turns out I now have nummular eczema. It did go away after using steroid cream but I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs a chronic illness and I‚Äôll have to deal with flare ups for the rest of my life... I just don‚Äôt understand what I did so wrong to deserve all of this happening to me. It feels like God hates me and isn‚Äôt even there for me. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve become so depressed.	Christian
"Your ""chonker"" dog isn't cute"	Obese dogs are not cute and I feel so fucking sorry for them. Letting your dog get fat doesn't make him cute and quirky ,its literally just animal abuse. I don't even understand how these people's dogs get so fat? Do they just never walk them at all I don't get it??? I saw a post on the front page with 55k likes and it's just a morbidly obese husky... Why get a husky (or any working breed) if you're not going to exercise it. Maybe use the time you use posting your close to death animal to exercise your damn dog instead.	unpopularopinion

The Pain of being a Hammer Main (Poem+partial serious discussion topic)	Oh hammer, you sweet pain Why have I ever made you my main &#x200B; Every strike and every swing Massive damage you will bring &#x200B; I rumble and tumble And aim for the face Then watch every monster crumble Under you sweet embrace &#x200B; But how I suffer so For every other weapon I try It just feels too slow &#x200B; No other weapon does damage like you do Tried the sword and board But the damage didn't follow through &#x200B; Bow, Bowgun, Dual blades Every one of them suffers the same fate For I have yet found A weapon so efficient to equate \--------------------------------------------------------------- &#x200B; Alright, now for something serious. I'm wondering if other people have this problem, mainly hammer (and probably GS) mains. Every other weapon feels slow compared to the hammer and I find it really difficult to get used to new weapons. And Im not meaning slow as in using it, but in dealing damage. I can take down a monster in 20 min in terms of damage where it just takes longer with any other weapon. Lot more dodging etc going on. And this is not too serious, I understand if I practice enough I can do the same damage with all weapons, but the hammer just makes the switch difficult. &#x200B; So the question, do other people have this problem?

Moving to WPB from Port St Lucie	So I‚Äôm hoping to move to WPB as soon as I can to be closer to work on PGA Blvd, but I don‚Äôt mind a 30min commute. I‚Äôm making 3.5k a month and was looking for a 1/1 or a studio around 1.1k a month, I want to live alone. Ideally I would like central air and a washer and dryer to be in the unit. Are there areas I should avoid? I‚Äôve been looking on Zillow and apartments.com and I really struggle to find anything that doesn‚Äôt have a catch. Also looking around lake worth if anyone has insight on that. I‚Äôm 23 and this is my first time ‚Äúleaving the nest‚Äù as they say so really any advice is welcome, even if it is tough lol. Thanks!

VIP 14 or Books of Covenant to rush T5?	I'm a mid-tier spender (growth fund, monthy gem supply, recharge events, and a few daily chests).I just got VIP12 and I have the gems to go just to vip 13 (around 150k gems).I'm only spinning wheels 10 times , as I still don't know for sure my troop orientation and my target commanders, and that's why I wanted to focus on getting as many universal heads as I can.So my objective was always vip 14.But as a ch25, I just realised I will soon be out of buildings to upgrade for a long time if I don't upgrade my castle which is still level 18 ( I am missing around 163k gems worth of books) . the rate I acquire books is very low (I recently started doing forts as much as i can and get around 50 books per day, so I will need more than 320 days to gather all books for free).Plus I want the extra 7% research speed the level 25 academy will give me, as I still have a heap of research to do before T5, and more than a year of universal speedups (not enough for T5 still, but I am acquiring many speedups from alliance gifts every day, because I'm in a spenders' alliance). So I'm in a dilemma: 1. will I use a large amount of gems on books when my building comes to a halt, in order to win valuable research time and get sooner to T5? but on the same time, lose months of vip 14 (and thus a corresponding amount of gold heads), or 2. use it only on vip and just ramp up on forts. as a result, in the long run I would have a few hundreds gold heads more, but I would lose a lot of research time, and my building would be at a halt for months, and T5 would come many months or even more than a year later. My aim is to kick some asses in war, and for this I need both T5 AND expertised top tier legendaries. I know everyone thinks differently, so I'm not asking you what to do.I'm asking what would you do in my position.	RiseofKingdoms
Python Intermediate/OOP Tutorials	Hi everyone, I am making an intermediate/object oriented python tutorial series at the moment. It will cover all aspects of object oriented programming in python, from creating classes to static methods to composition! Everything is explained clearly in an easy to understand way, and if you don't understand anything, I reply to comments usually within 24 hours. Here is the link to the first video, where I explain classes and instances. The next video will be out tomorrow, explaining methods and attributes: [https://youtu.be/r5BgVJNB5JA](https://youtu.be/r5BgVJNB5JA) I hope those looking into object oriented programming in python will find this useful!

Switched batteries, now lights stay on without the key inserted. Any ideas?	So my bike was stolen out of my college apartment complex last month, but the police found it a few days ago and I went to pick it up. It didn‚Äôt seem like anything was missing from it, and it seems like whoever took it just left it outside for a month (fuck me right) The thing started beautifully when I replaced the battery, but after I rode it around the block and took out the key, I noticed all the lights were still on - mainly the headlights and rear light, as if it were still running. Further, you can start it without the key inserted as well. My theory was whoever stole it might‚Äôve tried hot wiring it and screwed up somewhere between the ignition and battery, but I was wondering any of you have had a similar experience. Thanks for your help!	motorcycles

Considering one of you is heavily scientific-minded while the other is heavily humanities-minded, I think it'd make for an interesting discussion.	NDQ

Massive lists from throwaway accounts of reddit.	I've noticed over the past few months that whenever I search for something on here (typically a celebrity's name), one of the main results is always a throwaway accounts post of an extremely long list of celebrity names in alphabetical order. And the only comments are additional throwaway accounts adding more names to the list(with the exception of one comment thanking the OP.) And I'm talking thousands upon thousands of names. Just curious, is there some reason for these lists. I would think that if they're looking for traffic and clicks, they would use a permanent profile. Any ideas or info is greatly appreciated.

Feeling truly is understanding	I am done with the conventional method. Tonight I didn't count breaths I just inhaled and exhaled as much as I felt I needed, then held my breathe without any counting and without timers and just felt. I did this for maybe 4 or 5 rounds I hardly even counted those as well. Following this I used the last round (as I normally would) as like a Segway into meditation and I really feel like I had a breakthrough. At certain times I truly felt as if I was just awareness and not in any physical form, I was just there observing being existant. Truly an amazing breakthrough for me, I'm so excited for this new path I will continue down and follow as I feel my way through. I'm sorry if none of this makes sense or is out of context I've just only come back from this and needed to get it down somewhere and share it with anyone. For those of you who are looking for something within yourselves through this method, remember to feel and you will understand	BecomingTheIceman

TIFU by asking my partner to crack my back...	"So I'm going to preface this with this happened at the beginning of last week but I am very much stil paying for it... no one blames anyone for anything that's transpired and I am aware of the stupid decisions in this story. I've had back problems for the better part of my life, I used to do gymnastics and between that and the mild scoliosis, turns out I did some pretty good damage to myself. So I routinely self adjust my back and neck. I've gotten it down pretty good with the exception of the 4 vertebra between my shoulder blades. As far as I can figure out it's impossible to adjust those bones yourself. So this is mistake number 1, only adjusting part of your spine leads to issues, I know this, I do it anyways. So the result of that is I get very intense pain in my upper back and shoulders from the gas build up, I was desperate one night and asked my partner to adjust it for me. I showed him how to place his hands and push. Mistake number 2. My partner is a husky boy, he has been described as ""beautifully bear bodied"" and I have been told very recently I ""definitely need to gain weight"" (quarantines been rough y'all!). We get into position and he starts pushing, I feel a pop, no pain so I assume he's got something I didn't know needs to be adjusted. He keeps going, still not getting the joints to crack. He tries one last time (bless this man honestly he just tries his best) and I feel something.. not right. So we stop, we do our nightly routine (rip a bowl and throw on some shows) before bed and all is good. However when I woke, I swear to god it felt like someone had dug a giant spade into my side and it was peaking out the back. I look in the mirror, no bruising, but something's not right. I can't really tell much though and the pain started to subside through the day so maybe I just slept weird. The next day I woke up DRENCHED in sweat. Now I'm not a very sweaty person, I can count on one hand how many times this has happened to me. So I'm uncomfortable I have a fan blowing on me and a wet shirt on, so I go to take it off and the pain hit, instinctively I just grabbed my rib, light pressure and it felt way better! So I just sat with some pressure of for a bit. One I released my hand however the pain was back tenfold. Now your probably thinking hey you're now day 2 of terrible pain, maybe look at yourself a little harder in the mirror. Well when you and your partner are both hypochondriacs that's not usually the best option, it's actually something we both avoid regularly or we pick. So day 3 morning I wake up SOAKED again, finally I go and look in the mirror and my left side looks kind of swollen but I can't really tell unless I suck in. So I do that, fight through the pain and realize... The left isn't swollen... The bottom of my right side (where it kind of comes to a ""point"" if that makes sense) is sunk in. So I start to lightly prod my rib/sternum area and sure enough right where my rib connects to my sternum there is intense pain, if I follow the rib to the back, there is also intense pain. So basically to me and my paranoid self this confirmed I most definitely have broken a rib in two places. So I freak out, wake my partner up, he looks at it, his face sinks, and we're pretty sure he cracked my ribs. Were in a pandemic, none of the clinic's around me are open, and Telehealth doesn't cover anything past minor issues. So what do? You guessed it, to google! After many longs paranoid hours of searching I have no definitive answer on what happened to me just that if it is broken, they can't cast it so really the only course I can't take right now is pain management. And if it's not broken, essentially the same thing. First (possibly) broken bone and of course, it happens now. Every breath hurts, I never knew sneezing could cause so much pain, and guys, appreciate your normal range of movement I tried to open a window in my basement yesterday and needed to ask for help... TL;DR Local gentle giant fulfills fragile woman's request for cracked bones and exceeds expectations! More at 11."	tifu

How one character contributed to Shaun realizing that Lea makes him more	When Shaun held his monologue in 3.19 ‚ÄúHurt‚Äù of how he loves Lea because she makes him more than a *good doctor*, I wondered for some time how he came to this conclusion. So, I went back to the dialogues of past episodes and found two distinct conversations with a series regular that seem to build to the idea of the loved one making you more (besides the patients of the week, that also had their fair share in this). >2.13 ‚ÄúXin‚Äù: **Your life is better with her. You're a better person with her. Y-You need her. That's what love is.** > >3.17 ‚ÄúFixation‚Äù: **Lea's right. She is needy and selfish. Find someone who loves you the way you are.** ‚Äì People always say that, but shouldn't we be with someone who makes us a better version of ourselves? ‚Äì **Maybe. But trying not to be autistic won't make you better.** Guess which character said this? It was Morgan *twisted biatch* Reznick! Did I miss other relevant lines by other regular characters or has had Morgan more good influence on Shaun than we ever dared to believe‚Ä¶ ? ;)	thegooddoctor

36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar.

Pro-Nederlanddemonstraties aangekondigd op Facebook	"**LEEUWARDEN - Op de bekende website Facebook hebben verschillende mensen in Friesland en daarbuiten aangekondigd komend weekend grootschalige demonstraties te houden.

What are your thoughts on where Siege is at currently?	I've been playing Siege since Operation Chimera. When I first started playing the game I was god awful, couldn't win a gunfight to save my life and didn't know how the game worked. I took some time away and just learned the game, watched YouTube vids from pros and popular channels to get an idea how the game worked. I came back to the game and fell in love with it, it's all I've played. Since that time I've been ranked Plat and hover around a 1.4 w/l and a 1.5kd and from where I came from when I started I was proud of that. Lately though, I've just felt apathetic to the game, playing it has been more of a chore than something I enjoy doing. Maybe I'm just burnt out from playing or just lost the joy of meeting up with my friends and getting a few games together each night. Just curious what everyone else's thoughts on the game and where it currently is? TL;DR: Used to love the game, don't really anymore. How do you feel about Siege?	Rainbow6
My fianc√© is unemotional and never shows his feelings but I made him feel giddy and super flattered over this odd compliment	"So my fianc√© and I are complete opposites. I am very emotional and he is very rational. Despite we have conflicting interests, which I find sometimes annoying, I believe our differences makes us attracted to each other. Hear me out--he is the type of man who never becomes emotional over the small stuff. He is not open with his feelings. Like what I said, he is rational...almost too good to be true. STORY: My fianc√© and I were separated because of quarantine. Awhile ago, during our nightly phone calls, he mentioned to me that he recently almost drank every night since he found it enjoyable to do so while watching Netflix. Even if I was concerned about his health and weight, I told him to enjoy himself. Due to the heavy traffic he endured several months ago due to his previous work and the sudden unemployment he experienced afterwards before quarantine, I liked him to have fun for now especially that he is now working from home. Also, he works now in a respectable company. However, he said, ""what if after this we see each again and you see me have a big belly?"" And my reply, ""I still love you no matter what."" And you know what? He acted so giddy like a little girl and his voice went high pitched saying, ""really? you'll still love me?"" Of course, I said yes! Gosh, out of all the cheesy confessions I told him and he did not show emotions about it, this simple comment, ""I'll still love you no matter what"" works wonders?? Can you guys explain why?"	relationship_advice
Was Lovecraft ever known to watch any movies?	I understand film was perhaps not as commonplace at that time as it is today - and I‚Äôm just *guessing* it may have been expensive for some people? But there were plenty of movies to come out within his lifetime like Nosferatu, Phantom of the Opera, and Metropolis. Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton were pretty popular then, and in his last couple of years the Three Stooges came about. It seems like there was still plenty to see. Also I *vaguely* remember him describing in a letter (or maybe it was a character in a story) that he went to a demonstration of television, so i thought maybe movies would interest him as well. Did he ever describe movies in his letters?	Lovecraft

Dagegen spricht Einiges: Nennenswert Zinsen gibt es nur im Ausland und dort ist das Risiko entsprechend gr√∂√üer. F√ºr mehr Rendite k√∂nnte man auch den Aktienanteil erh√∂hen... Daf√ºr spricht, dass das Geld sonst nur rumliegt und es ja irgendwie eine Risikostreuung ist, das Geld wo anders zu investieren als in Aktien. Wie handhabt ihr das? Seid ihr bei einem Portal wie Zinspilot? Wie verargumentiert ihr vor euch selbst, dass euer Geld nicht ""arbeitet""?"	Finanzen

I'm (almost) a straight A student. AMA	For a bit of context, I live in Romania where the grading system works with grades from 1 to 10, 1 point being given for participation. I've always learned for test and the lowest grade I got was a 4 (F in american system) at Romanian (English equivalent in my country). Next lowest grade i think was and 8 (somewhere at around C/B). I haven't gotten any 4's after that one. My current situation is 10 over the whole year. I'm happy to respond to any questions. Sorry if I don't immediately respond.	AMA

I hate my family	"So basically my brother asked for help when i was sound asleep, being sleepy asf i said no. And so my idiot of a brother told my fucking mom and said ""kor kor told me to go die"" even though i had hardly enough energy to form a damn sentence. 2 minutes later, my bitch of a mother walks in and yells at me for ""saying a mean phrase to my brother"" then, out of nowhere, my extra of a father, that ONLY comes into my life to scold me, pops in and asks repeatedly ""what i said"" like a spoilt record. After hearing that, without even clarifying with me, he confiscates me Macbook and xbox, then my mom smacks me with a cane (long stick used for beating) and talks down to me, insulting me over and over. Im 14 and im still getting treated like this btw, I wanna run away and never see them again, i want to renounce my family name as i'm ashamed to have it. I want to murder them in cold blood. It's only a matter of when i will do it"	teenagers
Remember when the complaint was that every deck played Piloted Shredder, Sludge Belcher, and Loatheb?	Back in the GvG days we got frustrated that seemingly every deck (aggro, midrange, control) played Piloted Shredder, Sludge Belcher, and Loatheb, neutrals that dominated their mana slots. Highlander decks are beginning to give me a similar feeling. Minus a few standouts (Tempo DH, 'Pain' Warrior, Face Hunter, Priest to some extent) it seems like every class is trending towards highlander and seeing Zephyrus and DGA most games (on both sides) is getting old. They generate different cards, but the games feel like a waiting game until one deck can find some massive board swing to try to win the game. Zephyrs (as cool as he is) and DGA are so powerful, that every deck is going highlander just to have access to board clear and the 9-mana bomb turn. I'm not sure why they were made neutral cards. At least Bran summoning Krush feels Hunter'y, but hunter wiping your board with Zephrys is not really something Hunter should be doing. Rogue is not supposed to be good at board clearing either, but Zephrys lets them do it... and then they try to highroll the 0-mana DGA, which is a little salt-inducing. I've become concerned with the state of highlander decks. It seems every deck is trending towards highlander. There is almost no benefit to playing a non-highlander deck and no cost to playing a highlander deck because cards like Zephrys and DGA are so splashable and flexible. These 2 may generate different cards every time, but the games are beginning to feel too similar regardless.	hearthstone
I honestly found myself more impressed and felt more emotions watching the Mythica series than the new Star Wars films	This is not another anti-star wars rant. But I would like to point out that the Mythica series which was produced on a micro-budget kept me entertained for 7 hours. I have never seen a fantasy epic overachieve more than that series. I thought the action was crisp, the acting was solid and the world building and costume design was fantastic. Obviously special effects could have been better but this was independently financed. The first movie takes awhile to get going but I really enjoyed and I felt they got better as they went on. With the new Star Wars films I just felt like they lacked heart at sometimes. I never felt that with these	movies

Would a QoL league be badly received?	Let's except the case of GGG keeping the QoL features for PoE 2 for whatever reason. Let's say there's not enough time to develop a new league and QoL or various fixes (like performance). Would the player accept it if GGG did a league with only QoL and fixes, no new league mechanic ? It could either be a standard league ladder or a revival of a popular past league. Would you still play it?	pathofexile

Trying to save up for first home	My fiancee (25F) and I (25M) are trying to save up for our first home. If not much changes, we are hoping to have about $70K saved up by the end of the calendar year and we want to buy our first home together in the CA Bay Area shortly after (aiming to have 10% down payment). We want to live in the home but are also aiming for at least a two bath so we have the option to rent out a room. Her dad is also in construction (owns a concrete company) so we are also seriously considering buying a lot and building from scratch but I'm not sure if we'd be able to afford the needed down payment for that type of loan. Building would definitely be preferable if we could swing that. Combined we make $139,000 before taxes. Currently we have $46,000 in savings accounts ($26,000 is in a high APY Discover savings account, the rest in a normal Chase savings account). We also have $1880 invested in gold (1oz). We took all of our money out of stocks 3 and a half years ago and are trying to avoid risks. Other than meeting my employer 401k match, I don't plan on saving for retirement until we have a house as I see that as also an investment. In a few years (around 28-29) we are also going to try and start having kids. I lurk this sub a lot and I'm really just looking for a sanity check as well as any advice for achieving our goals in the quickest/least risky way. Given the current state of everything I'm also worried about high inflation but not sure if that's a valid concern. Thank you.	FinancialPlanning

Microsoft Premier Support Alternatives	By now, most if not all of you that have MS Premier Support agreements have been shown the glorious replacement for Premier called Unified Support. For those that aren't aware, Premier Support allowed you to purchase the contract sized appropriately to your org's support needs. The primary intent of these services was to provide support for your MS products. If you didn't use your hours for support incidents, you could convert those hours to use on proactive services or other 'nice to haves'. Now, with Unified Support, you are forced to pay for a service level that is based on your current MS spend. You get access to a dizzying ton of shovelware services that they present as the real reason to go with Unified and all-you-can-eat incident support included as an afterthought. For our org, the incident support was the primary reason for having the contract. The ability to convert that spend to something useful if we didn't have any significant incidents that year was an added bonus. MS still made a killing in that hourly conversion, but at least it wasn't a totally sunk cost for us. Even with this flexibility, we still struggled to use the hours completely every year. In our scenario, going from Premier to Unified is a 4-5x multiplier on cost. Graciously, MS allowed us to renew our Premier agreement for one final year. The number they want now is an absolute non-starter, especially given our current financial climate of trying to preserve cash. So, what are the alternatives if we just want a provider to help us get back up and running in a major incident that we can't solve ourselves? I've heard of US Cloud, but I haven't liked what I've read. What alternatives have you looked at or used? Our primary MS technologies are Windows Server and workstations, AD, O365 (has its own support except for on-prem integrations), and a small amount of Azure. Thanks all, stay frosty.	sysadmin

EVERYBODY is doing the Sage-Omen bug in Split. Rankeds are ruined.	I played 3 Split games today. All three of those games enemy team had Sage and Omen. They exploited the bug and even though we won the 3rd game, it was not fun. For those who dont know the bug, Omen can teleport outside the map on A site of map Split with help of Sage wall. He can see and wallbang anybody on A site, heaven and ramp. Enemy teams play 5 A all game, wait for Omen to take position and go in for a plant. Sometimes they even try to knife after the plant, because there is no way you see Omen and they know round is over. This is an absolute disaster. Please fix or intimidate with bans so we can play again. Right now I have to dodge every Split game.	VALORANT

Could use a little help while outlining (fantasy story problem, first-time author)	Greetings and thank you for checking this out, **The Charakters:** **Aldritch**: The protagonist, target of the mercenaries, son of basically the head of the magic mafia (the gus, who create and maintain magic contracts) who went on to study magic, is now on bad terms with his powerful family and is btw, a high level illusionist. Aldritch also has a fair understanding of the ins and outs of his families businesses, but there are certainly holes **Charlie**: A young pickpocket, who got teached a little bit of illusion magic by Aldritch, who fled his terrible living conditions together with him, feels indebted to Aldritch Charlie knows how to navigate the more troublesome places of society and can be helpful, when dealing with criminal activities **Josephine**: Former love-interest forr Charlie, now good friend, is a little bit cruel, manic, comes from the house of a minor noble and ran away from home to sick it to her stingy father Josephine, although she hates it, has knoweldge about the ins and outs in court and is rather talented at playing naive and innocent **Ms. Tucket**: Josephines brawny combat-maid, who protects her with her own life, out of a sense fo debt she feels towards Josephines lost mother. She is basically the badass-butler steereotype with a russian accent. She is a great survivalist and knows the ins and outs of adventuring very well, while she is also a talented maid. &#x200B; **Main Plot:** The main plot of the story is a group of charakters trying to find and infiltrate the Archives, a place where all sorts of documents regarding illegal activities are stored in a high security vault, to destory a contract, wich binds a group of undead mercenaries to their task of eliminating the party. (Aldritchs family, minus his aunt, want to rid themselves of the deserter for good this time) **The problem:** I am currently at about the first third of the outlining at the step where the group is supposed to find the rough location of the Archives, to establish a small base of operations for themselves, where most of the story will take place. My current problem, however is how they obtain the information of the location of the archives, wich are basically a myth in my world. &#x200B; **Possible solutions:** I have multiple possible options with varying dregrees of interest and charakter interaction. As a time -frame i have basically a whole chapter planned for aquiring this information: 1: Aldritch knows the location of the archives from his time in his family, as these locations where crucial to their business of trading and maintaining favors (he could also have been too young) 2: Aldritch contacts his aunt (his aunt rather crazy) per letter, to inquire about the archives. The answer will most likely be cryptic 3: Either Aldritch, or Charlie could have information regarding the transport of the contracts, to discern the rough location of the Archives. They would then track a courier, wich is identifiable via a random trait/object. This would include a nice scene, where Charlie and Aldritch could show off their skills in stealth and deception respectively. The tricky point here is how to aquire the information about the couriers, or means of transport. 4: Aldritch could use one of his 3 favors (he will need at least one later on in the story) to simply aquire the information no matter from wich source (these favors are quite powerful in my world, as Aldritch snatched a few before he left his family. These favors are basically a Get-out-of-jail-free-card, wich allow you to demand actions, wich are normally borderline impossible, like having someone place a certain item at a certain location without question. favors, of course, have their limits) 5:They could somehow get hired to conduct the transfer of the documents to the Archives through a great deal of deception and impersonation These are a few options i could think of, but i would highly welcome other suggestions too. If you have other quesitons I would be glad to answer them. I really try to keep my story logical and without any huge inconsitencies and this part really jumbled my marbles. Thank you very much for your feedback and have a wonderful day :)	writers

Lack Of PPE	I am a store manager of a store downtown and I am extremely concerned about the lack of PPE and cleaning supplies to open and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. We opened for curbside last week and were told that corporate would be sending us masks to wear while doing curbside. We still have not received them. I am down to one canister of Lysol wipes and no other cleaners. When I told my district manager, I was told to keep trying office depots website. She was going to get us gloves but has walked that back saying it isn‚Äôt required to have gloves. I called the city health department and was just told that the masks could be any face covering, that employees should wash their hands once an hour and that we should partner with other distributors to find cleaners. Overall, he just didn‚Äôt seem like he cared and gave excuses for my company which I have already heard all week. I‚Äôm genuinely concerned for the safety of my employees because I have a couple who are high risk that have to come back or I have to fire them. I‚Äôm not sure what to do to keep my customers and my team safe and I‚Äôm not sure who I should be reaching out to for a solution, the health department is no help.	cincinnati
New Legendary Hunter Idea	"My friend mentioned to me how the Bald Knobbers where a gang active in Missouri post civil war. Their look and mask is very distinctive and would fit in to Hunt: Showdown very well. Some quotes from the Wikipedia post: The **Bald Knobbers** were a group of vigilantes in the Ozark region of southwest Missouri from 1883 to 1889. They began as a group dedicated to protecting life and property, aiding law enforcement officials in the apprehension of criminals, opposing corruption in local government, and punishing those who violated the social and religious mores of their community. In some places, the vigilantes gained much political influence, occupied key offices, and became effectively the ruling faction in local politics. They made many enemies, however, with whom they had several violent, sometimes fatal, confrontations. In 1886, after gaining national notoriety from their exploits, and embarrassing state leaders, Missouri Governor John S. Marmaduke sent Adjutant General J.C. Jamison to Forsyth to investigate the situation. Upon arrival, although the representative was pleased to see the atmosphere of order that prevailed, he recommended to Kinney that an official dissolution of the Bald Knobbers would be in the best interest of the county. That next day a formal dissolution ceremony was held in the town square where the Bald Knobbers were publicly disbanded, having served their original purpose. It would make sense for the gang members that ""Lost"" their purpose in Missouri to decide to move to Louisiana and start hunting depraved evil monsters in an effort to restore order. They already have the violent tendencies of the other gangs of hunters in the game. With the perverse idea of restoring order to a lawless area. https://preview.redd.it/1jo3hfx275y41.jpg?width=575&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a35c4aaae9c0e98456ad213c5168ae81c940ab7"	HuntShowdown

I believe in you	"Hey guys! So I want to start by saying I share the same ""problem"" as all of you. My penis is small. One thing I want to pass along to you guys, is that there is a way out of the insecurities and lack of confidence. Obviously that's easier said than done. Everyone is different, and everyone's experiences are different, but for me, I have always 1.) strived to make sure that my oral (as in my speaking, not my sex) skills with women are prime, 2.) my oral (yup, sex) skills with women are prime, 3.) paying attention to what a woman's body language is telling you before/during sex, and I think most importantly 4.) just owning that shit from the get go. If penis talk comes up, I just tell it how it is ""yup, I have like a 3 inch penis"" ""I've got a small dick so"" I own that shit. And at first it's weird and embarrassing, but then you start realizing that once you have owned your insecurity. Damn does it lose that control over you. For me, I have had very positive sexual experiences using my small penis. I think the adage of ""it's not the size of the boat"" is a very true thing to an extent, and as long as you believe in yourself - AS I DO - you can break the shackles! Let's change the world, one small penis at time guys. Love you all!"	smalldickproblems

The Mother God heresy, and view of gender in Lutheranism	I saw that we are in agreement on this subreddit that the Mother God thing in ELCA is heresy. We've also had some discussion of gender here, particularly in a thread I started about a week ago, but I still have some questions. Since it's established in Scripture that God is male, Jesus is male, the disciples were all male, and the apostles/teachers are all male, I've made the controversial argument before here that women need male intermediaries. At most times, this has gotten downvoted, especially by women. But last night, it did finally get upvoted when I explained that I'd rather err on the side of reducing women's roles than ascribing to God any woman traits, in reference to the Mother God thing. It seems we need to establish more understanding and agreement on where gender should apply, and shouldn't apply, in the faith. There was also a lack of consensus on how much the wife should subscribe to the husband's denomination, such as in the recent dating thread. What takes precedence, a woman's submission to the husband, or correct doctrine? This question is very pertinent in the cases where the husband believes in symbolic communion and is in one of the non-Lutheran denominations, while the wife is in LCMS. Sure, we can always say, don't get involved in those unions, but I've seen more than a few threads here in the last few months on Lutherans who are involved with the opposite sex in other denominations, so we can't just sweep it under the rug. It exists. Finally, being female myself, I've had to accept over the years that it's better to place my trust in the hands of men than in what I think. Since God is male, it's awkward to pray to Him since I'm female. I like the liturgy, where I'm assured I'm praying something a male has established. So I rarely pray alone. I'm not even that comfortable singing hymns in church as women are supposed to be silent in the churches per Scripture, so I just whisper them. There's been debate over whether or not I used the correct word in saying women had less 'access' to God, but whatever the case, there do seem to be a number of gender distinctions in Scripture, and I'd rather err on the side of giving women a reduced role than give us too much. If that means I require male intermediaries between me and God, then I accept it.	LCMS

How do I access a China-only website from outside of China?	This time, it's not using a VPN from within China to access Western websites; it's the other way around, but I didn't find much tutorials on how to do that. Are there VPNs with servers in Mainland China? P.S. It's for someone I know. They want to access a local government's website.	China

39 [M4F] Looking for my best friend who is also my soulmate/lover....	**About Me:** Hi, I am 39 currently residing in Texas, single. I like to play board/video games as well as binge-watch shows and movies. I like to go window shopping as well as to the park and lake sometimes and enjoy getting out of the house from time to time but prefer to stay home most days. I love anything from Arts Drawings, paintings, abstracts, 3d graphics. Crafts (More of do it yourself type of crafts.) I love going to flea markets as well as yard sales, museums, fairs, and amusement parks. I love music of all types from oldies to alternative to today's pop/rock. I love history and learning about history, especially from the medieval era. I also love to go camping and fishing as well as archery and many other things. *I care more about who a person is, rather than what they look like or weigh or what health issues they have. I care more about how I click with the person and what we have in common and the persons personality.* This is important and looking for someone who is kind of the same way. **What I Am Looking For:** Someone who is single or divorced, not married, not separated, not in an open relationship or attached but is single and in the USA. Someone who I can eventually settle down with. Be romantic with. who enjoys gaming either it be card games, board games, video games, or just binge watch movies or tv shows. who enjoys the flea markets, parks, lakes, long road trips to nowhere. enjoys slow dancing and snuggling. Someone who is serious and wants to eventually live together and be a real couple. Someone to grow old with and to have a long lasting relationship with. P.S. I been playing World of Warcraft us server horde and would love to find someone who is into that as well.	cf4cf
It hurts to see your name	You pop up everywhere. In casual conversations, in notifications on my phone that I can't bring myself to block, in my thoughts every time I see/hear/experience anything even slightly related to you. I thought this would get easier with time, but it hasn't. Your name still hurts today just as much as it did when we stopped talking two months ago. Two months may not seem like much, but I've never let myself become attached enough to anyone to hurt for more than a day or two. &#x200B; Even after all of the pain you've caused, I still can't bring myself to regret you. You're still my best friend. You're still my brother. You're still someone I would move mountains to protect. I can't hate you or even be angry with you. I can only understand you. Unfortunately, understanding you doesn't make my pain or fear go away. If anything, I think it makes both feelings stronger. &#x200B; I don't know if I'll ever heal enough to talk to you again. If not, I hope you live well. I hope you find the strength and goodness I always saw in you. I hope you conquer your pain and stop doubting yourself, because you are capable of so much. I hope you find friendships as deep and meaningful as ours was once. I hope you find love and happiness and all of the good that this world has to offer. &#x200B; For myself, I only hope that someday I can smile when I see your name. &#x200B; \-M	UnsentLetters
Grade Drop Appeal	Would the current situation with COVID19 be a good reason to appeal to the school council for a delayed class drop? My mother had to go into surgery during this time so I was with her the whole time and couldn't really focus 100% on school work.	UIUC
Is my Miata cursed?	This is the third time this car has broken down on me at the worst possible time, second time that it's left me stranded on the highway. First it was harmonic balancer bolts backing out (probably my fault), then it was the pilot bearing locking up one day into a road trip, and now just when I thought I had everything good to go, a heater hose splits on me on my way to work. I love this little car, but I swear it's just trying to make my life miserable. Ok, rant over. Back to your regularly scheduled programming.	Miata

Any skinny girls with hooded lids?	So a picture of Adele popped up and I saw that she had hooded lids before the weight loss and now you can see her crease and all, she has no hood left. I knew a girl in my high school who was normal weight but on the heavier side and when she lost weight her hood was fully gone and she could apply eye makeup without any bother. I checked other weight transformation pics on Instagram and it's the same with every girl. I am 5'6 and bellow 100lbs atm, I used to be thin all my life, I turned 130lbs in high school and then went thin again. The hood is the exact same, no difference. Anyone else having this? I feel like only me and mature women have hoods when skinny.	Trufemcels
Assassin‚Äôs creed Odyssey not working	I bought in Stadia this game and all I have is a ¬´ Testing connection.... ¬ª screen. No game.. All other games are OK.

[Q] How to look at how many people have won a Pick'Em gold trophy?	"In 2017 I won the trophy: ""Gold Atlanta 2017 Pick'Em Trophy"" and I knew it was pretty rare in that time (Australis won but no one expected it because it was a new team). I won with 75 points and I saw that only 1% got 75 points or more so I knew not many people got it because the requirement for gold was 75points. The only problem is how rare? I have no idea how many people participated in the event or how you can search how many people have won the gold trophy. Do you know how?"	csgomarketforum
Haven't been taking this seriously	Joined NoFap about a week or two ago. Found the name intriguing (While watching nsfw) and clicked on it. Since then I haven't been watching any porn after seeing multiple inspiring posts. Before I found NoFap I thought I was just a bad egg. A one in a million person having 10 seconds of pleasure a day. The porn stopped. But I haven't. Please find some time to motivate me.	NoFap

League should have 2 step verification	"So basically few days ago i was writing to Riot support for unrelated reason and when i logged for the fifth time i realised that if someone will hack into my account i will lost acess to all Riot games. In my opinion to increase security we should have a two step verification. It could be classic e-mail way, sms code (bcs they already have our phone numbers for clash), code in mobile app or even using outside verificator like google authenticator. Many other companies are using these methods and most of them allow to turn off the 2 step verif so it is not irritating for people who don't like it or don't feel they need it. League already have mobile app so they don't need to create new one for it. I contacted the support to ask if they can tell me if Riot is maybe working on it but they told me that becauses Riot didn't mention anything about it they can't ""uncover"" anything."	leagueoflegends

Why isnt ranked language locked?	"In what world is a healthy match promoted by 3 people speaking one language and 2 others speaking another? I just don't get it. Solo tyr loads into lobby with atleast 4 people screaming in their mic in Spanish and build 70% cdr. Mids ""lagging"" at a slick 1 and 16 starting defense and selling completed items twice. We really need to be able to language lock or something. Ping checks are a plus."	Smite

Pandemics are one of the factors for food insecurity	Most people in Brunei have never experienced the fear of going to bed with an empty stomach. Unfortunately, many around the world do not have the same experience. A [study](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/covid-19-could-double-the-number-of-people-on-the-brink-of-starvation/) by the WE Forum estimates that the current pandemic will double the amount of people going without food to 265 million worldwide. Food insecurity does not necessarily mean just having no food, but it can also be when the availability of food is uncertain or sporadic. Shelving funding for food aid and the stay at home orders will deal a hammer blow to food production-with lack of labour- and thus impact food price. During the previous food price crisis,[prices](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/25/impending-global-food-crisis) skyrocketed from 2010 to 2012 and previously in 2006-2008. Can nations that are now in recession cope with feeding their population? With all resources being channelled to fighting the virus, countries that do not have food security will suffer the same fate as in the earlier 2010s.	nasikatok
[Activity] Mindful Monday	It‚Äôs time to set your intentions for the week! What will you do to work mindfulness into each day this week? Mindfulness is the intentional practice of slowing down and being present in the moment. It helps to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. It can include all five senses and some examples are: connecting with nature, aromatherapy, meditation, guided relaxation, yoga, gratitude journaling, relaxation music, and much more!

If the 2 days rollback can't be rollbackbacked ...	Please * Extend the PvP Season by 1 week, or make everything count double for the remaining week (matches for the season rank, wins for achievements ...) * Extend SAB by at least 2 days * Make a double-everything bonus for WvW next week (double WXP - not just the usual 100% call of the mists bonus but a real double after buffs ; double skirmish claim tickets) * Triple the returns per node in home instances tomorrow, especially paid ones. Also send the daily (paid) hunters stuff 3 times. Oh and daily login reward too. ... yes I lost all of that - and more - spent the whole weekend playing. Can't catch the pvp season anymore for example.	Guildwars2
Exercising and intermittent fasting	I‚Äôve being doing IF (16:8) for about four months now. I started running in the afternoons about two months ago. During this time, I had no problems sticking to my windows (eating from 10-6). Now that the weather is getting hot, I‚Äôve switched to running in the morning, which means I am positively ravenous by 8 am. I‚Äôd like to avoid shifting my eating window earlier (I enjoy sharing dinner with my fianc√©e, this is important to me) but man, hunger pangs! Any advice for how to deal with IF while exercising?	intermittentfasting

It's so annoying when people type like 'omgggg did you see thatttt I knnnoooowwww'.	(This is a lame one.) Maybe most adults can't relate with this, and I'm pretty sure this is a preteen-teen thing, but pretty much everyone I know texts like, 'Omggg, thankkkk youuuu Ilyyyyyyy' and it's SO annoying. Better use caps or a bunch of exclamation marks. But please, please for the love of God, don't use dragged letters. It's so pissinggggg offffff (see?). I'm not even talking about an exclamation per se. I'm talking about regular conversations. Maybe something like, 'Did you hear what Sara said about Julie?' and the response goes something like, 'dudeeeee yaaaaa I can't evennnnnnn'. Maybe I'm just weird in that sense, but I end up reading it as 'dudeyyyyyyy'. Hopefully this is a habit people grow out of, because it's frustrating.	unpopularopinion

Looking for recommendations for my sister, a soon-to-be Columbus transplant!	Hello Columbus Redditors! I hope it is ok to post this here. My sister just went through a crappy divorce and decided to take her company up on an offer to relocate to Columbus from Austin. Her move has been delayed due to COVID-19, but she is very nervous to live on her own in a brand new city and I was hoping to get together a list of things she could do when she finally arrives. I am hoping for any and all kinds of activities, food and drink spots she has to try, and any funky local things that go on, the weirder and more colloquial, the better! I‚Äôm an amateur artist and I want to put together a homemade illustrated ‚Äúguide‚Äù for her of outings, spots, activities, and attractions. I would be happy to post a link here when I‚Äôm done if anyone else would like it. I would also love to illustrate any local features/curiosities so those are welcome as well! I just want to give her a way to feel more at home. Of course, if you don‚Äôt want to give away the secrets of your city I understand, but I‚Äôm hoping to at least get some lowdown on spots that won‚Äôt come up in a Google search of ‚Äúbest things to do‚Äù. My sister is single, so she is looking for friends, lovers, and things to do beyond hitting bars (although she will definitely do that a fair amount). I really appreciate any help you can give, thank you for reading! Edit: She is 33, she is very social and will enjoy almost any activity if there are people around. She loves football and baseball and her taste in music is mostly country but if it‚Äôs live music she will enjoy almost anything. She is an incredible singer and loves karaoke. She is pretty active but not super outdoorsy. She loves food, especially Italian. She also loves animals of all kinds and has 2 large dogs.	Columbus

Lucid Sex + Flying + False Awakening	"After a serie of vivid dreams, my alarm rang. And instead of doing a technique, I just went back sleeping because I was lazy. I had a 2 long dreams before being lucid, then I found myself in my bed in darkness. I thought I was awake but I said whatever let's just do a reality check... I plugged my nose and I could breathe through it. I ""woke up"" in my old house, in my room. Then I started rubbing my hands cause my dream was fading away. Then I explored and as I was out of my house, chilling on my terrace, I told myself when I enter my house again, there will be the finest girl from ""Gooba"", you know that 6ix9ine new music vid. I went in and she was there, in my living room. You all know what I did next. No one really talks about these sex experiences, but every frequent lucid dreamer (which I'm not) had them. Well, anyway the sex didn't really seem real except for the orgasm which was so great, and in the morning, I had the sperm in my pants. Next thing I did was leave my house. I wanted to fly but I had never done it before. I also wanted to talk to my subconscious by interacting with dream characters, but no one was there. So I decided to fly. And I had it first try. I jumped, then I flew off. It was so incredible. I could see my native island. It was the same, until there was a part that my mind created. It was a Savannah. Without really controling it, I landed there. There were lots of elephants and other animals. Seconds after I landed, a Lion was trying to attack me. He was dangerously close to me. I took off just before it had me and was so amazed at all I had experienced Last thing that happened was my dad waking me up. He's not even in the same country I am but it didn't seem to surprise me. I was upset and told him he ruined my lucid dream. He told me I had things to do and he couldn't wait for me to wake up. Then, I woke up for good and still was upset, but this time for not realising I was still in a dream. Do a reality check everytime you wake up, this won't happen to you. Ps: During this dream, I had this problem with my eyes. Sometimes I could open both, but most of it, only my right eye was barely opened. It made my vision blurry, no matter how much I stabilized the dream. I still had a great time. But if someone knows anything about this, let me know thanks !"	LucidDreaming

I'm at a loss	Probably should be posting this in /r/relationships but here goes: I want to break up with my current girlfriend. For months now. While I'm happy with our relationship, the fights that we have are unbearable. It usually starts with something minor that I did (taking something I suggested as ordering her around, playful teasing, hell even the playful banters evolve into full blown fights). The thing with these fights is that she's big on amends. She wants me to make up in some way and until I do, she treats me more or less like trash. I think that over the times that this happened, i eventually lost interest in genuinely making amends and just resort to saying whatever just to appease her. Which is not me. And now, it's taking a toll with my mental health. We've been together for over a year, there's been ups and downs, and somehow during those down times I've convinced myself that things will get better. That we'll both be mature enough to deal with arguments better. But it didn't. It's always me having to patch up things with her. Sure, it's all fun when we're not fighting, but when we do, I feel less and less in love with her. But i don't know how to breakup with her. I know that if I do, she'll self-harm, or worse, kill herself. I just know she'll do it. She has issues that I don't think I can help with alone. Being the only reason for her to go on in life isn't good for her either. So yeah, I'm at a loss.	CasualPH

Within a few days they had gotten back to me asking for a shipping address, and sent out a brand new folder. Total time between first contacting them and having the new folder in hand was about a week. Really impressed with this quality of customer service."	gundealsFU

The Next Covid Crisis Could Be a Wave of Suicides	The isolation, grief and economic hardship related to Covid-19 are creating a mental health crisis in the U.S. that researchers warn could make the already-rising suicide rate worse. A study [released Friday](https://wellbeingtrust.org/) tried to quantify the toll. The paper, which was not peer-reviewed, found that over the next decade as many as 75,000 additional people could die from ‚Äúdeaths of despair‚Äù as a result of the coronavirus crisis, a term that refers to suicides and substance-abuse-related deaths. The research was done by the Well Being Trust and researchers affiliated with the American Academy of Family Physicians. ‚ÄúI hope in 10 years people look back and say, ‚ÄòWow, they way overestimated it,‚Äô‚Äù said John Westfall, director of the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care, who co-wrote the report. Even as the American economy rebounded after the last recession, suicides and overdoses cut into Americans‚Äô life expectancy. Mental health experts worry that the economic uncertainty and social isolation of the pandemic will make things worse at a time when the health care system is already overwhelmed.

Gillette Guard for head shaving (any alternatives?)	Hi all! I've been shaving my head for years, and I recently heard about the Gillette Guard razor. It sounds right up my alley, however I live in Canada and have yet to find a source for them. eBay has them of course, but they would have ran me almost 70 bucks and shipping would likely be over a month or more. Where could a Canadian go to track these down? Amazon doesn't have them either. Alternatively, is there anything out there that is a good 2nd choice in the absence of the Guard? Something of a similar nature that is more easily found on this continent?	wicked_edge
Passed SAA-CO1 (889/1000) - What Now?	Edit: Thank you Jon for the amazing practice exams :) You are a god **Materials Used:** Acloudguru, Whizlabs, Jon Bonso Practice Exams, Tutorialdojo Passed on 5/8/20; 2.5 months on-off studying (passed CCP 2 weeks in); no Computer Science background or experience **Exam Review:** The exam was definitely a bit easier than Jon's and Whizlab's practice exams. My test was heavy on EC2 & EBS (14 questions), KMS & different types of encryption (7-8), S3 (probably 8 questions), RDS (6-7),SQS (4+) and VPCs (12+ questions). Oh, and a bunch of really tricky Cloudfront & ELB questions peppered in. There were 4 nearly identical questions about VPC endpoints as well. I found that Jon's & Whizlabs question explanations were perhaps the most pragmatic way to study before sitting the exam alongside tutorial dojo. Whizlab's questions were up to par, but their explanations sometimes fell short in comparison to Jon's. I was getting mid 80s on both practice sets before sitting the exam. ACG's course did not provide anywhere near enough information and was presented as a high level overview. I found that their course wasn't well put together (many misspellings & mess ups) However, having access to their entire platform with different cloud tutorials sparked curiosity in other areas of cloud computing. **ONVUE:** How on earth have they not figured this out yet. I tried taking the exam early April and sat watching myself being recorded for nearly two hours. I felt my soul leave my body after 45 mins. I eventually gave up and my money was refunded. Second time around it was only a 30 minute self-stare. It almost feels like they are performing a social experiment which tries to see how long people will wait. Without speaking to a proctor, my exam began. I wasn't worried because I saw that this had happened to others on this subreddit. halfway through this guy named Sean abruptly chatted me up, saying that I had to refrain from speaking or miming the words which was super upsetting. I said sorry and he disappeared. Just a reminder that they are watching. **What Now?** So after all that build up for studying for the exam, I'm at a fork in the road and don't know which direction to take. I have a remote internship working with AWS for a company from June - July, and I want to get more practical skills under my belt before it commences. I've recently enrolled in Harvard's CS50 free course online to gain some foundational computer science skills, but I don't know if this is where I should be spending my time. I want to explore more of what cloud has to offer. Should I go for Sysops or devops? Is it really pertinent seeing that they overlap so much? Or should I learn a tangential skill like coding fundamentals? Or something else?	AWSCertifications

Day 1	So I've pretty much jacked off everyday since I was 12 (I'm now 18), and about a year ago I started noticing that I could only get hard from porn. I took a two week break and was able to get boners without porn again, but unfortunately I went back to using porn every day. I've taken roughly two week breaks 4 times now, and they always work for getting my boners back, but after that the temptation is too strong, and I go back to using porn and then only being able to get hard from porn. I'm writing here because I want this break to last, hopefully forever. I figure if I write this on this page I will be more likely to stick to my goal. Thanks. Also, what would you guys say is the chance of me sticking to this goal? (for at least 3 months)	NoFap

Railjack Universal Vacuum should be the standard across the game	\*With the exception of active gameplay drops (ammo pickups, orbs, etc) &#x200B; Losing out on loot because you didn't see it or you weren't fast enough to pick it up before the mission is over feels pretty bad overall. &#x200B; Stuff like Resources, Parts, Blueprints, and other such things which have value outside of a mission should be automatically picked up for every player participating in that mission, or at the very least, there should be some kind of loot preservation system (Like Destiny's Postmaster, for example) &#x200B; Imagine you have been trying to get that one last Brakk part from the G3 for months, you are doing a defense mission and they invade almost at the end of it, your squad kills one of them, doesn't mark the drop, and you aren't aware that part you wanted was in a corner of the map until you notice there's something you didn't grab, it could be the part you are looking for, it could be something else, you rush to it but the mission ends and the part was just barely outside your companion's vacuum range. Too bad, best luck next time, right? &#x200B; I don't really understand why it has to be like this, I sort of understand the affinity range in ground missions, I believe that's alright, specially with how some abilities rely on affinity range instead of their own range value, if Universal Vacuum is good for Railjack, why not for the rest of the game? &#x200B; If there really is a good argument against universal vacuum on ground missions, why not a Loot Preservation System instead? &#x200B; Imagine you go to Maroo's Bazaar and she offers to sell back to you the loot you missed out on the last few missions you ran, maybe she's been tailing you this entire time, Tenno leave lots of valuable things behind after they completely destroy everything in their path, Tenno can't just pay attention to every shiny little thing that falls on the floor, that's where Maroo comes in, she cleans up after the Tenno storms through missions and as part of her service, she can return what you missed for a small fee! (credits, endo, resources, etc), that way, you won't miss out on that one thing you needed and couldn't help but leave behind.	Warframe
I feel like this comment summarized my problems with current Beastars pretty well.	"Credit to u/that1trainsguy ‚ÄúThis has always been one of my biggest nitpicks with Paru's writing, and I guess now's a good time to bring it up: from Chapter 140 onwards, her worldbuilding went in a direction which I personally found myself trapped in when I tried to do it - I became so involved with the motifs of the narrative I was trying to paint, with all the little tidbits of it, with all the (ultimately pointless) trivia that I forgot to tell a compelling story, or even a story at all. The dialogue went from high schoolers or individuals of that age navigating an increasingly dark and hostile world to a messy pastiche of tropes and wikipedia-like soundbytes explaining the most minute and irrelevant details of the world. And as this happened, the story devolved from a believable set of circumstances which, despite their overbearingly nightmarish grimness, weighed down the protagonist in a way that wasn't utterly overwhelming to a mess of grimdark nonsense. By this point, we're so far down the hole of grimdarkness that it's hard to see any chance of happiness for either Legosi or any of the deuteragonists. Even Jack, Legosi's childhood best friend, the vehicle for fluffy and gentle moments which serve as some sort of redeeming patch of light in the unbearable darkness of the world of Beastars have vanished in favour of a narrative of obedience and servility in different types of canines. It felt absurdly shoehorned in, as if every part of warmth had been sucked out of the setting. Even the grimmest, darkest, most bleak setting has some level of comfort for the protagonists. Otherwise, we're privy to a torture story. It's as if Paru's characters are becoming less themselves as individuals, with their own quirks, behaviours, and personalities, and more vehicles for broader ideas pertaining to this vastly layered society and its structure, which is an absurdly double-edged sword. Without said characters, we can't even explain half the ideas which she throws at us because there's no vehicle to do so. It comes down to a sort of Flanderisation, only less about reducing the characters to a singular trope within themselves, and more about reducing them to the defiance of the stereotypes imposed upon them. And I want to make this absolutely clear: none of what I said is a bad thing. It is entirely possible to write an inescapably grim but compelling story where the main characters are in a state of constant, inexorable anguish, and where their ends are known. However, those stories are made great by additions of some manner of hopefulness, some manner of humanity, something relatable. Paru's writing has rendered even Legosi and Haru's relationship from an expression of ultimate gentleness in a cruel world and a triumph of deep intimacy over instinct into...this incredibly bland, flat series of arguments about the same old things: ""instinct"", ""predation"", ""fetishism"", and so on, and so forth. They no longer talk like a real couple, there's no reason for them to be together anymore because they don't interact outside of their ""do we have sex to defy our natures"" dynamic. Louis is slowly becoming the most compelling character because he's less concerned with saving the world - or rather, becoming an instrument to save the world - and more of an ego-driven individual who actually wants and needs something. And I can't believe that's the case because we've now arrived at a complete inversion of how the situation was initially. At this point, if Haru and Legosi got together and lived happily ever after, Melon finally got his shit kicked in (jesus christ god almighty what is taking so long, what are you building up to), and we could turn the story to someone actually compelling, I'd be thrilled. God, give me the story of Sebun's first interracial romance. Give me the story of Juno and Louis realising they don't owe this world shit. Give me any level of catharsis, anything beyond another thousand fucking paragraphs of wikipedia-like bullshit about whales saving the world or the Beastar being an asshole. In closing, Beastars keep going larger. And it keeps stretching itself thinner. And I don't see it ending well, frankly.‚Äù"	Beastars

Need to build a computer for the Sims.	"I've been building forever. I even have all the blinky lights. 3800x, 1080ti etc. I've overclocked, done graphite mods on processors, custom water cooled rigs, you name it. Now I need to do a ""budget build"" and have no idea where to start. The only requirement is it must play the Sims well. Will on board (I even hate saying it) graphics be enough? I'm assuming amd if using on board stuff. Building a pc for the price of my cpu seems ridiculous to me, and I end up using ""good parts"" and going over. I could use a hand finding the quality at the bottom. Can it be done under $400?"	buildapc
Pure Madra path benefits	I was thinking about different paths and it got me thinking that so far we haven't see that many benefits of a pure madra path or any particular reason Eithan would choose one. Benefits: * Easy on the channels allowing a lot of madra to be put into techniques * Has a soothing effect on Lindons channels after blackflame * Powerful for nullifying striker techniques Drawbacks: * No ruler technique/weak to ruler techniques * Doesn't have the best enforcer techniques (although Eithan says this Lindons seems pretty good) * Doesn't have much in the way of attacks (Either shatter their core with a striker technique or disrupt them a bit, no inbetween) * No defensive capabilities apart from striker attacks From Uncrowned it seems that the Aurelius clan specialises in storm and lightning based paths matched with their extraordinary sight; Eithan who gives the impression of being a long lost scion from the Aurelius main line seems to be on a weaker path. Obviously most of Lindon's focus has been on blackflame but he would be a shadow of the sacred artist he is if he only had a pure path. While Eithan is a very powerful underlord that seems to be down to his iron body, large core and excellent command over bloodline powers rather than his path at all, arguably he would be a lot more successful with a different path. So it got me thinking that pure madra might be more of a 'late game build' while BlackFlames are a deadly threat at copper maybe Pure madra paths don't start seeing their benefits until Archlord+. The counterpoint being that none of the higher advancements seem too fussed about his path or future advancement. Could be because I'm blatantly wrong or maybe there hasn't been a pure madra sage/herald so people aren't aware.	Iteration110Cradle

My father constantly controlls my life and life choices	"I'm male 17 and my father constantly controlls my life choices like what high school should I go to,what job would i work and I really can't go on like this.It destroys every ounce of respect I have for him.2 years ago when I had to choose what High School I should go to he made me go to a school I didn't want or like (car electrician),I said 2 other schools I wanted to go to but he wouldn't even listen he litteraly dragged me to go to that school,and when my mother says that he made me go to that school he gets offended and defensive saying that we are lying.But this thing happened today.I always loved learning languages and I already know a few languages (my native,English,German,a fair bit of Russian) and about a week ago I started learning Japanese (because since I can remember I always loved Japan and I always wanted to travel there and hopefully live there one day) and he called me on the phone and asked what am I doing,so I said learning Japanese for the next 30 minutes he was lecturing me how much useless I am,how I will never accomplish anything in my life,how retarded I am because I am learning that amount of Languages and when he finished his lecturing he said ""I don't care it's your life you are gonna destroy not mine"" and hanged up.That destroyed me,that litteraly destroyed me.I don't know what to do,I was thinking of running away from home but I don't have anywhere else to go.I need some help."	helpme

What is personally your favorite TOP lane match-up and why?	I can't stop smiling like an absolutely idiot while facing off against Riven players. I love the simplicity of her, the easy combo's you can follow, the mitigation of her damage when you blind her stun duration, and taking grasp to freely poke her every 4 seconds for a stack and healing. She isn't played all that much anymore due to her being pretty shit in comparison to other top laners, but she never ceases to make me happy.	TeemoTalk

Crazy neighbor thinks my dad wants to date her	Okay, she's not exactly entitled, but this story deserves to be here. Here's a little backstory first: My mom and dad have been married for at least 20 years, and my dad continually says my mom is the love of his life.My mom doesn't like to talk to this specific neighbor because she's rude, and fake. Anyways, here's the story. (I was told this story, I didn't witness it) Basically, my mom hates this neighbor. She (neighbor) was actually rude to me and my sibling (she literally closes the door in our faces, never says thank you, etc.) So, my dad recently had an encounter with her, in which he called her by the wrong name. Somehow, she turned it into him liking her?! Idk. She's weird. So, she tells this to another neighbor (he's pretty nice, and he knows why my mom doesn't talk to this lady) And he sent my mom an email about it. In her mind, she thinks that my mom doesn't talk to her because my mom is jealous. The nerve (if you could even call it that) of some people.	EntitledPeople

Well fuck. Priorities.	This is an update to [my previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/f9dzxe/13_years_keep_chickening_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Apparently pandemics have a way of putting things into perspective. Wife (LL) and I (HL) are quarantined separately, thank god. We know we would kill each other if we were in the same house. But you know what happened when we couldn‚Äôt have access to each other? Shit got sexy again. Honestly I don‚Äôt even know how this works but I‚Äôm blown away. Reading my last post is like going into a time machine. My brain Is so scrambled I cannot believe the difference a few months make. The past 50+ days have been so off the wall and also incredibly mundane at the same time, but they have provided the oddest most productive foundation for some priorities to align. First of all, let‚Äôs address the regained ‚Äúbedroom:‚Äù Due to her health issues, we are forced to stay apart for the time being. (I know in my prior post I had mentioned moving out, which is true, but I‚Äôm quarantined in yet another different place for a number of reasons) Yes, this means our sexytimes are via phone/Facetime. But even so, this is literally some of the hottest shit I have ever heard or felt. She has INITIATED, MORE THAN ONCE. Like... full blown tells me to do NSFW things to her and stuff. This has been a major confidence boost for me. I still have some confidence issues due to constantly getting refused or deflected for so long, but it‚Äôs way better now. It‚Äôs seriously a world of difference when your partner fucking *wants* you. As far as us having fundamental differences, that is still 100% true. Neither of us thinks living together is a good idea. But if this pandemic has acted as some kind of wake up call about our romantic involvement, then so be it. We both understand the deep connection we have just on a person-to-person level. I never thought it would be a problem still be attracted to each other and love each other even as a ‚Äúseparated couple,‚Äù but that was apparently her biggest road block and thus caused her to shut down sexually before. But now that we are actually forced into this situation, she must have come to some kind of understanding of not taking me for granted or some such thing. I don‚Äôt actually know what happened to be honest. All I know is that we miss each other like crazy and that from the moment she actually admitted that she wished we could hop into bed together, all bets were off. Now for the changes on my end: I have to admit that I have come into an even greater understanding of the health issues she faces now more than ever. Her illness has absolutely played a role in the previous demise of our bedroom and I don‚Äôt think I gave it enough credit before. She has a severe autoimmune disease and as of these past couple months is on heavy medications and completely immunosuppressed. These new meds she just started taking at the beginning of the pandemic and they kick her ass every week. So some of this has needed to come around to my understanding of her experience and just how exhausted she is all the time. It sucks because while I understood some of her pain before, I didn‚Äôt know it could get this bad. And now I‚Äôm just wishing I could do more for her to feel better but there‚Äôs not much that I can do besides emotionally. That being said, I am a lot more considerate of her needs, yet simultaneously we have more ‚Äúsex‚Äù now than we have had in the past year even though she feels worse in general. Btw, lest I sound like a dick, I do not push or pressure her in any way shape or form. It‚Äôs completely up to her what she is up for. The sex is specifically because she is into it. Our communication has become more focused because we aren‚Äôt distracted by other things too. So if she is too tired, she might also add that she *would* want to talk dirty if she were physically up for it. Which is great because then I at least know that she wants to be with me. But in reality she probably needs to sleep. To reciprocate on my end, that could look like me sending her a nice voice memo of some sexytimes and then she can crack it open for a listen when she is ready. Btw, I highly recommend trying that out. It‚Äôs a great way to be expressive and get your rocks off if the relationship is a little too strained for in-person contact, and if your partner is open to receiving something like that then they might find themselves even more turned on than they thought. Who knows. We have talked briefly about whether or not a divorce should be in the works. Mostly we are both way too stressed out with this pandemic for any of that to matter. And with the newly rekindled ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù there may be no use for it. Ultimately as far as the relationship itself, and on a heavy note, I can‚Äôt see myself not being the one to take care of her. As I watch her health decline it scares me. I don‚Äôt have any interest in ‚Äúfreeing‚Äù myself of this relationship just to go try and find someone and go through the work of getting to know each other. That sounds exhausting and wrong. I don‚Äôt want someone else. I want HER to continue to know me and want me. Not only that but even more importantly, I don‚Äôt think I could live with myself if something really serious happened with her health and I couldn‚Äôt be there. I want to be here. I just want it to not be a continuation of the dumb push-pull cycle (mentioned in previous post). Right now it feels pretty different and I don‚Äôt know if that is a fundamental change that the pandemic has caused or if it‚Äôs just circumstances. She has fully owned that she legit wants me, not just on the phone. We social distance visited and she told me she wanted to rip my clothes off so there‚Äôs that lol. At the end of The day if she is okay with being ‚Äúseparate together‚Äù as a bottom line then I‚Äôm okay with it. As long as we can reunite at some point, FFS who knows when that‚Äôll happen. Anyway, TL;DR: My wife (LL) and I (HL) were on the verge of divorce after a very DB and lots of conflict but then this pandemic happened, forcing us to isolate separately, and then we missed each other and she started initiating phone sex and it turned out to be insanely hot. So now sex is back on the table and maybe the divorce is off the table but who knows? Let‚Äôs hope.	DeadBedrooms

It hurts to see your name	You pop up everywhere. In casual conversations, in notifications on my phone that I can't bring myself to block, in my thoughts every time I see/hear/experience anything even slightly related to you. I thought this would get easier with time, but it hasn't. Your name still hurts today just as much as it did when we stopped talking two months ago. Two months may not seem like much, but I've never let myself become attached enough to anyone to hurt for more than a day or two. &#x200B; Even after all of the pain you've caused, I still can't bring myself to regret you. You're still my best friend. You're still my brother. You're still someone I would move mountains to protect. I can't hate you or even be angry with you. I can only understand you. Unfortunately, understanding you doesn't make my pain or fear go away. If anything, I think it makes both feelings stronger. &#x200B; I don't know if I'll ever heal enough to talk to you again. If not, I hope you live well. I hope you find the strength and goodness I always saw in you. I hope you conquer your pain and stop doubting yourself, because you are capable of so much. I hope you find friendships as deep and meaningful as ours was once. I hope you find love and happiness and all of the good that this world has to offer. &#x200B; For myself, I only hope that someday I can smile when I see your name. &#x200B; \-M	UnsentLetters
CD Projekt Red, Cyberpunk 2077 & Baldur's Gate Kazuliski	"Previously I have alluded to the fact that Baldur‚Äôs Gate essentially laid the foundations for what CDPR would become today. Without Baldur‚Äôs Gate its conceivable there would be no Witcher or Cyberpunk 2077. Baldur‚Äôs Gate would also be responsible for introducing me to CD Projekt back in the summer of 2000. So, how did a D&D game that was developed by Bioware and published in 1998 by Interplay Entertainment, help establish the RPG powerhouse that is CD Projekt Red? In the early nineties, it was almost impossible to get hold of games in Poland, legal ones that is, although Polish copyright law was non-existent. Marcin Iwi≈Ñski, Vice President and co-founder of CD PROJEKT, would fortuitously fail to qualify for a computer course he wanted to take in high school, forcing him to study mathematical physics. In this class, he would meet future business partner, Michal Kici≈Ñski, who at the time was selling bootleg Atari games. Serendipitously, CD-ROM‚Äôs were becoming ubiquitous. Being able to fit the data from hundreds of floppy discs onto one CD was a game changer, particularly in Poland. Thus in 1994, Marcin, would create CD Projekt. The business was essentially two guys in a room of a friends flat. Marcin would comment that ""Our main competition here in Poland was always pirates."" The national stadium in Warsaw, was home to Eastern Europe's largest flea market, and was Poland's largest exporter of counterfeit goods, games and music. Pirated copies of games would usually be available for ¬£3, roughly 48 hours after release. But what if CD Projekt could convince people to buy a legitimate copy instead? Marcin had an idea. ""We made the biggest bet back in the day: we wanted Baldur's Gate."" Iwinski developed a relationship with game publisher Interplay and began networking with game companies and attending events around the world. In one case, he met BioWare founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk and pitched them on localizing the popular RPG *Baldur's Gate* for Polish audiences. BioWare agreed, with one caveat, CDPR would have to do all the work. ""We said we'd take the risk,"" says Iwinski. ""Of course, the decision was very hard for us. We worked six months on the localization. I was working on it. My father was helping, because he was a producer on movies at the studios that employed famous Polish actors. This was a game that established totally new standards. He knew it would be popular in Poland because it was an awesome game. At the time, Polish gamers were more familiar with Russian, than the English language, so having a Polish localisation of a game that relied heavily on text would be a boon. It cost ¬£30,000 to licence 3000 copies from Interplay, and localisation cost the same again. Then there was marketing, physical production and hiring Polish actors. Notable talent included Krzysztof Kowalewski, Piotr Fronczewski, Wiktor Zborowski, Marian Opania and Jan Kobuszewski, amongst others. Baldur's Gate cost ¬£30 when it came out, which was expensive for Poland. Iwi≈Ñski was hoping consumers would be prepared to pay that much for something special. A regular game in Poland was selling at the time circa 1,000 or 2,000 units. On day one they sold 18,000 units of *Baldur's Gate*."" CD Projekt was subsequently forced to rent a separate warehouse just to hold copies of *Baldur's Gate* before it shipped. The game ended up selling over 100 thousand copies ‚Äì a new record, and thus CD Projekt was firmly established. The success paved the way for further distribution agreements and would convince Marcin that CD Projekt should attempt making their own IP. And thus, they turned to a relatively unknown fantasy series of novels and short stories, written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, about a Witcher called Geralt of Rivia.

[Q] How to look at how many people have won a Pick'Em gold trophy?	"In 2017 I won the trophy: ""Gold Atlanta 2017 Pick'Em Trophy"" and I knew it was pretty rare in that time (Australis won but no one expected it because it was a new team). I won with 75 points and I saw that only 1% got 75 points or more so I knew not many people got it because the requirement for gold was 75points. The only problem is how rare? I have no idea how many people participated in the event or how you can search how many people have won the gold trophy. Do you know how?"	csgomarketforum

Flare-up of chronic health condition - prayer request.	Hello all. May I please request prayer for a health condition I've got (auto-immune lichen schlerosus) as it has flared up really badly recently and now looks terrible. Painful too. I'm worried because I've had it for a long time and there is a possibility of it turning malignant as time goes on. My doctor is phoning me tomorrow morning (they are only doing phone consultations initially because of the covid-19 crisis). I just hope that she will agree to see me in person as it really does need looking at. I've been so anxious & isolated and this is the last thing I need. Thanks!	PrayerRequests

New to Apex in S4, got 10 wins with each legend (stats and hopefully new player guide)	I am not good, let‚Äôs start there. I‚Äôm 42 dad with 3 kids but I wanted to get into apex to play w some friends. Everyone talks mains but I never stick w 1 character so decided to do them all. Hopefully this helps other new players decide who is ‚Äúeasier?‚Äù To start with. Win rate from best to worst and a quick new player opinion. Wide mix of ranked/pubs, 50/50 solo or in a group. 1.Pathfinder- I got the hang of his grapple pretty quick (probably from other games I‚Äôve played) and once I did wow he is so fun and strong. Imo he‚Äôs the best and a must have on every team 2. Gibby- Perfect new player legend, brings so much to the table. 3. Crypto- I‚Äôll be upfront, I watched a bunch of videos prior to playing him. He was so fun to use but unless you wanna put in time to be good with him he‚Äôs really tough to play for new players (I definitely hurt my team when I first started) 4. Revenant (after buff)- Another really good new player legend imo. Use the totem going into every fight, pretty straight forward, if you get off a bunch of damage push if not quick heal and go again 5. Caustic - Started slow but really started hitting many wins once I got a hang of his kit. Very fun to use and great for a new player that might not have positioning down 6. Bang- Good legend for new players, speed boost to get out of trouble with smoke and ult to help you position. (Just please don‚Äôt shoot the smoke at the enemy, smoke yourself to get away and heal) 7. Watson- Being able time block out some areas and eat grenades definitely won me a few games. Wasn‚Äôt a quick learn though by any means 8. Mirage - I love the decoys man, won me so many 1v1 fights. Also really good when looting boxes or figuring out where the heck you got shot from. 9. Wraith- I know how great she is but I just didn‚Äôt pick up that style quickly, the difference between an ok and good Wraith is huge. 10. Bloodhound- Great to know where people are but the ult is just not for me, too jarring of a screen change. Also I felt like people learned to react to his tactical. 11. Lifeline (played her after nerf). I don‚Äôt like support anyways and that seems to be the only thing she brings to table. It was a struggle. 12. Octane - I put up good kill games with him but just struggled to win.

Successfully resisted urges	Yep I did it. By the time of writing this post, this is around the second or third time I genuinely resisted an urge and thought things through before anything. This habit doesn't serve me anymore. Though it feels fine in the moment, the disappointment I'd feel in myself if I were to relapse is stronger than that. It feels good knowing I choose to do the right thing even though the opportunity was right in front of me. I think this is a huge step towards my goal, and I hope that everyone works hard to achieve theirs too :) Be safe, friends.	NoFap
my parents consider me as a gifted kid, here's my story	my mom used to tell me that a doctor told her that i was a gifted child, and that was mostly true for the rest fo my life, i get very high grades in biology, physics, and math, i can solve some problems quickly and so on, im still bad at other subjects like language or history, people that i know (relatives, freinds, etc) tell me im intelligent, the only downside is that im not very social, i get bullied a lot and i dont have that many freinds irl, only some freinds on discord. if anyone shares the same experiences please let me know, goodbye.

How to get an ISTP to do stuff	(Fellow ISTPs, feel free to add things in the comments) We‚Äôre not that difficult if you understand us tbh. Stop begging/pressuring us to do things. MAKE us want to do them. We‚Äôre extremely attracted to emotionally independent people, and we love relationship confidence. The more you allow us to be ourselves and make our own decisions, the more we will love you. **EXAMPLES:** Instead of: ‚ÄúHow was your day? :)‚Äù Try: ‚ÄúCocoa puffs is the superior cereal. CMV.‚Äù Instead of: ‚ÄúI really want you to come spend time with me at my parents house :( ‚Äú Try: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go to my parents and attempt to bake this pie. It would be awesome if you could come help me, but no pressure‚Äù Instead of: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs really hurtful that you never come to my parents house with me :(‚Äú Try: ‚ÄúHey, next week can you stop by my parents house with me for an hour or two so they aren‚Äôt worried about us? When they haven‚Äôt seen you in a while, they start to ask me 20 questions about our relationship and Jr stresses me out..‚Äù Instead of: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you text me all day? Are you not happy with me? :(‚Äú Try: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never gonna believe what happened just now‚Äù **WHEN AN ISTP IS BEING DISTANT:** *Do not:* Go crazy and take it personal. PLEASE don‚Äôt pressure or guilt us into talking, being affectionate, or hanging out until we‚Äôre done recharging. *Do:* Wait patiently for our relationship-y side to recharge, and stay connected to us by showing us how you‚Äôre entertaining yourself while we‚Äôre away. Show us that you‚Äôre *okay* when we‚Äôre in our bubble, and you‚Äôre confident enough in the relationship to know that when we‚Äôre charged back up, you‚Äôre the first person we‚Äôre going to. **WHEN TO TALK TO AN ISTP:** When we‚Äôre being distant for longer than 2-3 weeks. This usually means there‚Äôs a problem in the relationship. Prepare for a breakup, or to learn that ISTP isn‚Äôt fully happy with you.	istp
What did I do wrong here?	"I've been reflecting recently on encounters I had with girls before the lockdown and what I could have done better. This one - in February - I never really understood. I was in a club and a Spanish girl approached me and said ""you're here again? I remember you - you said you work for [employer]"". I didn't remember her at all, but assume I probably briefly spoke to her on a previous night out when drunk. Anyway, we went to the bar and I bought her a drink. We danced then went and chatted outside. She started being all self-depreciating saying she just works in a low paid job and has bad English. I cheekily said ""no, no - eres... inteligente!"" and she burst out laughing. I got her number and we then went on 2 dates to bars and restaurants. She was pretty flirty and laughed a lot. She texted after the 1st date ""I loved meeting you. You are very funny"". Prior to our 2nd date sent a winky faced text. On the 2nd date got me to touch her bra and made a lot of sexual references and innuendo. Anyway, I invited her round mine for dinner on the 3rd date. All seemed to be going well - she enjoyed the meal, we had some wine, sat close to each other on the sofa, and she seemed in a very good mood. Then I went for the kiss and she was like ""what are you doing?"" Then she said, in a baffled tone, ""you want me to kiss you?!"" I asked why can't she kiss me. She replied ""Que??"" (What??) It all then went very awkward as I tried to put into google translate (my Spanish is worse than her english) that I was confused as to why she would come on several dates with me if she didn't like me. She then went home. Recently she's started texting me again this week during lockdown, asking how I'm doing. I'm doubtful as to whether keeping the conversation going will be worth it since she wasted my time so much back in February. I don't really understand her behaviour? Surely if you're a girl and you meet a guy in a club, he subsequently invites you round for dinner on the 3rd date, why would you then act baffled and reject him when he tries to kiss you?"	seduction

I caught up with this wonderful series this past week	"Men what an amazing journey! I watched the first episodes of the anime and got interested, especially because I read this was like Hunter X Hunter, but I honestly think its more similar to Tokyo Ghoul, a manga I really love and Kaneki is very similar to Baam as well. I liked the first season, but things start up getting so much better with Jue Viole Grace and the introduction of Wagnan who's a character I didn't expect I would enjoy reading about. There were many great moments: - The meeting of Rak with Baam and finding out he was really alive. - The date of Endorsi and Baam. - Khun using tactics and intelligence to carry fights is just amazing. - FInding more about the families, I absolutely LOVED MASCHENY and ASENSIO in the data world, they were so incredibly badass against Jahad. And Eduan Khun is a character I also enjoyed a lot. - Ehwa is a great character I loved seeing but sad she can't appear because her flames are hard to draw :( - Hwaryun is another great character, love how chill and smart she is, has the answers for everything and when caught up lying she's like ""Yup I lied, congrats on finding out, now can we move on?"". A small thing I really like is how she considers Baam her GOD, that line ""Who am I to question the decisions of my God? If he wants to save his master I will follow him"" or something like that, it felt badass. - Jinsung Ha is a character I didn't expect to love so much either, he also thinks of Baam as his God, I can't wait to see the look on his face when he sees Baam bursting walls in order to save him lol, especially with Karaka at his side. - I love how intimdating Karaka's eyes are, its so characteristic of him, he has a certain dangerous aura. - White is a character I went from ""Fuck Hoaquin"" to ""Wtf I love Hoaquin"", he's a real nutjob and glad he's on Baam's side. Miss Vicente though... - I wish more characters died, the cast is just WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too huge, I have to do like Rak and call them turtles. - Missing thunder kid Khun Ran and Anaak too, sad they don't appear more often, especially with Isu now doing amazing things. - I really liked how antagonists are presented and show how menacing they are, especially Kallavan, he's one of those foes that's out of anyone of the regulars league, not even Baam can fight him head on after all that training. Hoaquin, Kaiser, Hell Joe, Doom, for example. - I liked the introductions of Evankhell and Yama, at first I was like ""Fucking hell not more characters..."" but men Yama's transformation was INSANE! He looks majestic asf and Evankhell, I love how powerful she/he is and it seems those flames are related to the ancient power Rak has. - Secondary characters I enjoyed: Isu, Wagnan, Sachi, Boro, Isu, Vicente, Ehwa, Hatsu, Hockney, Jingsun Ha, Yuri. - My favorite characters are Mascheny, Endorsi, Hwaryun, Khun, Rak and Jue Viole Grace, the edgy emo version of Baam. The things I didn't enjoy were: - The cast is way too huge, we get some cool characters and BAM they dissapear... You can't get too attached because of it. - The power creep of Baam is something I don't like, I felt he should've kept the power level he used against Jahad much longer, instead he got powers ups after power ups after power ups... He left behind people like Ran, Rak, Endorsi, Anaak, Hatsu, Cassano, Horyang, Laure, etc. I hope the power ups ease up for a bit now, its getting a little silly now in Baam's case, would prefer he use his genious like intelligence in fights like he did with Kaiser. Glad I caught up with his amazing series and to be able to discuss crazy theories in this sub!"	TowerofGod

Incoming live feed falling apart	Hey guys! So we're hosting an event where our guests do streams on our channel. They are streaming directly into my vMix with SRT (via OBS 25), and we put the stream out to our channel. Last week we had 4 gameplay streams, and only one had problems I've never seen before. [https://youtu.be/Vw1Hl4o2TWg?t=1831](https://youtu.be/Vw1Hl4o2TWg?t=1831) Go to 30:30 in the video, for some reason I can't link with timestamp As you can see, the feed is falling apart. This was only a problem when there was no movement on the screen: when the guy is racing, we get a clear picture, but when he stops or goes to the menu, it gets worse. The weirdest thing is, he started shaking like a madman on his webcam, and for the most part, it fixed the issue. So movement somehow mitigates the problem, but I have no idea how or why. In this case, the streamer is using an Elgato HD60s to capture the gameplay from his Xbox, and streaming it to me with 6000kbps. The other 3 streams didn't have this problem (in 2 of them the game was played on the streamers PC, and in the last it was captured via NDI locally) So now I'm testing for tonight with another guy, completely different PC and network, but another racing game captured via Elgato. And he has THE SAME PROBLEM. They stream with their own setup directly to YouTube daily, never had this problem before. Any ideas what's causing it? Please help!	vmix

Why do you think that women have it easier than men while chads have it easier than Stacies?	The only thing that women can get easier than men is sex and nothing else. Sex is a pleasure that only last a few minutes. Stacies can only get commitment from chads if they‚Äôre lucky, heck I literally see normies cheating on their Stacy girlfriends. However a chad can get both love AND sex from women, he can literally get that from women better looking than them. A chad-lite with a great personality can get a giga-Stacy wife in a heartbeat while most giga-Stacies have to struggle to get commitment, emotional support and loyalty from their looksmatch. The emotional support they they get from men less attractive than them isn‚Äôt even that genuine cause it will be gone the moment where she loose her beauty wether it‚Äôs in an accident or by gaining weight. I am a woman, but If i reincarnated as a good looking dude then i will be extremely happier than if I woke up looking like Scarlett Johansson. A good looking tall man, just have to have a great personality, hobbies and passion, be able to pay his bills, and trust me he will have an army of Stacies and high-tier loyal beckies that will fight to get his commitment so that they will be his sweet lovable wife. A Stacy on the other hand don‚Äôt have have an army of chads and high tier normies that will fight to be chosen as her caring, sweet, protective husband. She will just be traded for another Stacy, because of how much men crave variety. Average looking men can also easily get commitment and love from women that are just 1-2 point above them and they know it, that‚Äôs why you have many videos teaching them how to get hot girls, but you don‚Äôt have YouTube videos that teaches women how to get hot men, it teaches them how to get a man to commit to them, and see them as something more than a living fleshlight	PurplePillDebate
Theoretical Quiet Title Situation - What is the outcome?	This is purely theoretical, but I'm curious as to what we think the outcome would be. Location: US (FL) * Person A buys several plots of land. * Person A goes to prison on serious federal charges. Person A has a family and needs to take care of their family. Person A also needs money for attorney fees. Person A also does not want assets siezed. * Person A gives their family member (Person B) verbal permission to sell properties on Person A's behalf while in prison. Person A may or may not be aware of this, but Person's A signature is forged onto deeds by Person B, transferring said pieces of land from Person A to Person B. Person B knows notary (Person D) that can facilitate this for Person B. * Person B facilitates homes to be built on the plots of land several years later via Person B's property company. * Person B (and Person B's property company) sells to Persons C (say 5-10 people) homes using aforementioned forged deeds as proof of ownership. * Persons C pay fair market value for homes, absolutely no knowledge of fraudulent activity. All Persons C have owner and lender title insurance. No issues come up in title search. * Person B uses profits from home sales to keep Person A's family afloat, and to pay for Person A's attorney fees while Person A in prison. Person A and Person A's family see all profit from property sales. * Person A gets out of prison several years later (like 10-15 years). Approx. 1 year after release, Person A tries selling one of the properties they wanted Person B to sell for them while they were in prison. Person B had never gotten around to it. Person A assumes the property is still in their possession, perhaps forgets about verbal agreement several years prior. Finds out Person B still owns said property due to forged signature of Person A, and has Person A has issues selling. * Person A now sues Person B's property company, along with all of Persons C via a quiet title action, stating that all properties belong to Person A because Person A was in prison at time of signature, and thus could not sign documents while in prison. Person A falsely claims that Persons C were all warned of the fraudulent activity, but Persons C (all of them) have no recollection or record of this. What happens to all Persons involved? Would Persons C be protected under boni fide purchaser? Who do the properties belong to?	legaladviceofftopic

[Q] How is pricing determined?	I've noticed that the price differences between sites like steam and 3rd party sites aren't always proportional. For example, the karambit tiger tooth FN is $630 on steam and $425 on 3rd party sites, meaning that the 3rd party site is 67% of the price. The talon knife tiger tooth FN is 71% cheaper on 3rd party sites. I have sent trade offers where I am overpaying if you calculate with 3rd party sites, but they think the offer is a lowball bc on steam I am underpaying. What platform should I primarily use when evaluating and sending trade offers?	GlobalOffensiveTrade

[Idea] I think you would all enjoy working...	**...if it wasn't so kafkaesque**. It took me a while of practical thought to get here, but I'm logically here with my train of thought. Instinctively humans love to feel resourceful, as it is a trait carried to us from our neanderthal forefathers. However given the state of affairs that exist today (between wealth inequity and the lack of communal presence related to one‚Äôs job), we have a big portion of the population (myself included) who are anti-work. However, we still have people that enjoy playing games like ‚ÄúThe SIMS‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnimal Crossing,‚Äù we have people that love slice of life shows, such as ‚Äú[The Devil is a Part Timer](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama),‚Äù a big portion of the population who are anti-work, also enjoy the idea of work from afar. But why? I recently watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhD2rmhcBFM) video discussing a theory about ‚ÄúAnimal Crossing‚Äù. In summary, the main character is dead and you are in purgatory. The theory is is partly evidenced through the ideas that life within Animal Crossing is very simple. Work is simple, bills are simple, owning a home is simple; and life within Animal Crossing is simple because it is viewed through the objective lens of a [deceased?] child. Kafka poses that through excessive bureaucratic burdens, people are left confused in paperwork. We don‚Äôt know what's going to happen next, nor where to turn [/u/blom95], and we are stuck in this jungle of complex ideas with little ideological substance. Gone are the simpler days of working communally: as the towns blacksmith, or the state‚Äôs [teacher](https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/). Instead, are the days of working as someone‚Äôs *senior insurance claims adjuster*, woo! The aforementioned ideas parallel and describe the anti-work situation today. Work no longer provides the working individual **meaning** in their pursuits (not true for all careers, but true for most). Work is no longer a simple lifestyle, but at best, complicated. The population of anti-work is not a lazy population, but rather those who desire a simpler life.

Really struggling	It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve posted on here. I was doing so so well. I honestly remember driving home from a few months ago thinking ‚Äúoh my god, I can‚Äôt believe the life I allowed myself to live, I can not imagine ever wanting to drink again!‚Äù Here I am. My (ex) SO and I had a few days where we drank together after this pandemic and his dad passing very suddenly (like dropped dead in his bathroom suddenly). He was an emotional wreck for a few days. And we were drinking heavily for a few days together. Then everything came to a head. We got very intoxicated and his mood flipped. He got very very violent with me. I was terrified. The next morning after waking up I told him it was over and I knew it was bad timing but this just could not happen again, we had to get away from each other. This is a four year relationship, we haven‚Äôt had sex in a year or so, so it‚Äôs not like it was great and I thought I was SO ready to be out. Here we are, living together and I‚Äôm dying. I feel like my heart is being ripped out of my chest and I‚Äôve been drinking (not currently). I‚Äôve been drinking with my neighbors, I‚Äôve been drinking alone, with friends who are also trying to quit but we just tell each other these are unprecedented times and we should give ourselves a pass. But here I am, I haven‚Äôt really stopped drinking since this pandemic started (save a few days here and there). I‚Äôm unemployed, lonely and depressed and feeling so worthless. My ex seems fine. He lives in the spare bedroom. He hasn‚Äôt drank since his violent outburst. And I just feel like a bandaid that needed ripped off.	stopdrinking

Homebound [Science Fantasy, Fan-Fiction, 3000 words]	"Hello! I'm looking for feedback for the first chapter of my (incomplete) science fantasy, a League of Legends fan fiction. **Summary** It follows a teenage inventor on a mission to reverse a tragedy, and an earth mage who's just recently returned to her homeland after a long exile and is now searching for her nomadic family and tribe. A mysterious power brings the inventor to Shurima, a desert continent, intertwinig his path with the mage amid the land's most tumultuous time. Here, a newly re-risen empire rules again, threatened by internal strife, foreign intervention, and restless ancient powers. The inventor and mage must find their way home, all the while uncovering dark secrets about the land, the people around them, and themselves. (This is not fluff by any means, and does not intensely focus on romance. It also shouldn't require lore or game knowledge to understand). **Chapter Info** The chapter I have linked follows the inventor's POV. It's written in first person and is about 3000 words (3200 if you count the little note in the end). The next chapter follows the mage's POV, which again alternates back to the inventor's in the chapter after that, and so on. I'm concerned about: * The opening scene. I've had this piece critiqued before and some of them have mentioned that it was a bit too difficult to read. * The hook. My hook exists as a memory, and someone commented that I should've made the hook ""in the scene."" It gave them enough reason to stop reading past the first line break. * The narrative style. This is my first attempt at a first person story, so I spent a lot of time trying to get the inventor's narrative voice right (and am in the process of tweaking the mage's). Some have commented that the narration has a bit too many declarative sentences and could use some sentence variation here and there. * Clarity. One reader suggested that the chapter gets a bit confusing later on, but that they did understand what my MC was trying to achieve. Because of this, I fear there may be parts that don't logically flow well. * Other stuff that I may not have caught. This chapter will serve as the framework for how I'll write the other chapter's of the inventor, so I'm hoping to clean it up as much as I can and find strengths I can replicate, and weaknesses I should avoid. At the very least, I want to know if it's interesting or not, and if it's worth turning to the next chapter. I've had this work critiqued many times, which have lead to massive improvements since its first version and lessons about writing in first person. I'm fairly certain I don't have to completely change the chapter, and that there's still some stuff I need to iron out. That's all. Honesty will be much appreciated, and I'm open to any questions about the chapter. Thank you very much in advance [Homebound Chapter 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16dFpyOZoII_KqmWvqWC2ai0aEkdmuYdf2Po3IgGhDf8/edit?usp=sharing)"	fantasy_workshop

36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar. If you're on the same page, hit me up."	chat

Finishing rough end of rubber(?) floor	Hello, English is not my first language so I hope I can describe our situation clearly. In february, I started working at a new bar here in the Netherlands. Since the Corona crisis, we are closed after being open for just 6 weeks. So now we try to fix little things at our place. And of course our budget is very tight right now. The floor here is made of some sort of hard rubber tiles. And the walls are very rough. There is this ugly space between the floor and the wall we'd like to finish. See here: [floor edge](https://imgur.com/gallery/JPNPfOI) I was thinking of placing a plinth on the floor and filling the gap with some sort of epoxy of concrete. Would this work? And what would be a low budget material to work with, while being strong enough to be cleaned every day? I hope you could steer us on the right track!	DIY

It feels harder because I can't be mad at her	It's day 3. Still feels like day 1. We had the healthiest relationship. Never fought, and anytime we had issues we always discussed them maturely like adults. We were always on the same team against the problem, desperately searching together for a solution that would foster a continued long term healthy relationship. Our friends always looked at us as the quintessential healthy happy couple. We were the example they looked to for what they should want in a relationship. I think in everyone's eyes we were already married and the whole proposal, ring, I do thing was just a formality to be taken care of at a later date. We were happy. And then her feelings just started to fade. Over the course of a month she started having constant anxiety attacks over her guilt and fear about how her feelings were changing. I thought it was just the stress of a hard semester and quarantine, but I guess it wasn't. She was miserable when she told me because she knew how much it would hurt me and she didn't want that because she still loves me and cares for me so much, just not like that anymore. There's no other guy, but sometimes I kind of wish there was because then I could just be angry at her and move on, but I can't. She brought me so much happiness and she didn't do anything wrong, and it just makes it so much harder because it feels like this didn't have to happen. This is really hard.	BreakUps

Bethesda, please make the ghouls at Radiation Rumble drop High Radiation Fluids!	Radiation Rumble is quite possibly a very big missed opportunity. Players can‚Äôt find enough high rad fluids and the rate at which they spawn is bizarre. Radiation Rumble should have at least 1 out of every 5 ghouls or enemy spawns drop fluid. At the event at least 10-15 ghouls flood into the room all at once and (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) more just keep coming as you accumulate more radioactive ore so that means at the start of the event you can get at least 3 and more fluids and way more of you do well. This should have been one of the best ways to farm HRF since that stuff is so rare and valuable. Most nuke zones don‚Äôt spawn tons of mobs anyway outside of the Whitesprings. Please make this event more valuable by having the enemies AT LEAST have a chance of dropping HRF.	fo76

Halfords said their rear dashcam doubles up as a reversing camera. It does not. What can I do?	I am fucking livid. I went to Halfords and asked them to install a stereo, and asked for them to install a rear dashcam that can be used as a reversing camera too.

All in all I paid like ¬£600, went to reverse and the camera didn't come on the screen. Went back to Halfords a few days later and they told me it's not a reversing camera. I am fucking livid because I've already paid for it all. Is there anything I can do? They just said it's my problem and I can buy another reversing camera and pay for installation again.	AskUK
What do I do about my (18F) uncle (43M)?	About a year ago my uncle moved in with my family, he claims his reason for moving in was because he had just sold his house and wanted to wait for the market to crash before buying a new one. My mom accepted this because she and my uncle had been through a lot growing up and she wanted to help him out. Once he moved in it was never really an issue because he worked odd hours, often only being home from 2am to 11am. Once the quarantine hit he had to keep going to work because he was in an essential service field, but he was really mentally shook by COVID and after talking to a doctor about anxiety he somehow managed to get about 6 months off of work, he hasn‚Äôt gone since the end of February and he won‚Äôt be going back until the end of July. Ever since we had the switch of him not going to work anymore and being home all the time the dynamics in the house changed drastically. Usually if my uncle had anything to say in the past it was probably going to be something negative about my older brother, but in January my older brother moved out, and the focus switched on me. It grew slowly, often being comments about me getting high (I have a medical card, and I choose to smoke weed for my ADHD and my anxiety) and he would often say that I‚Äôm not worried enough about everyone‚Äôs lives with COVID 19 and that I was putting them all in jeopardy, despite the fact that it wasn‚Äôt my fault that my school closed later than most and I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere else. Now it has gotten much worse, at this point he won‚Äôt even say hello to me in the mornings when I first wake up, the only thing out of his mouth is a complaint about something I did or even blaming me for things I didn‚Äôt do, like one cup left in the sink, or a single water bottle on the table. I‚Äôve taken to having to walk on eggshells around him in my own house, trying not to do anything to set the bomb off. My parents see this and agree with me about how annoying it is, and my dad had to sit him down and have a talk with him about his treatment of me. That was about two weeks ago and it certainly got better for a time, we were actually able to speak again without him calling me names and I even came to his defense once or twice when my mom started talking about how awful he is. This all came to a head yesterday, in one of the biggest blowout fights my family has had in awhile. It was Mother‚Äôs Day and both of my older brothers came to visit (no other family) and we were all having a really nice day. Later in the night my brother and I were hanging out in the garage talking and my uncle walks in and immediately hones in on me, saying that someone peed on his floor like an animal and asking if I knew anything about that, he also somehow managed to call me a retard during this (I‚Äôm a girl what the fuck how would I pee on his floor). My brother hears this and just immediately goes into what the fuck mode, and my brothers pretty famous for having a slightly bad anger problem, he immediately starts berating my uncle for talking to me like that. My uncle then immediately takes it to the next level, bringing up past fights and raising the volume til they‚Äôre yelling at each other, then I see my brother start to stand and I immediately realize that he‚Äôs about to make things physical so I start screaming for help and my oldest brother comes sprinting in, pushing them away from each other and my dad brings my uncle inside. Later they come back out and everyone apologizes to each other and I thought things were going to be okay again, until after my older brothers left. I was still in the garage and there were a few wrappers on the table, I was standing to start cleaning up and my uncle walks out and starts to call me homeless for the mess that my brothers had made, as I was in the process of picking it up, he starts to say how clean he keeps the garage and how I just come out there and don‚Äôt give a fuck. I just start to ignore him, because it was obvious he was seeking a reaction. I‚Äôm still picking up and he‚Äôs just standing there insulting me in different ways trying to get me riled up, he even attacked my boyfriend at one point for ‚Äúnot having a home‚Äù (his parents might be kicking him out, it‚Äôs a really bad environment and I‚Äôve been trying to help him find a place) At one point I just looked up and he was grinning ear to ear, and I just called him an asshole and left. Now it‚Äôs the morning and I don‚Äôt know what to do, after the way he treated me last night I don‚Äôt even want to see him again but he lives with me so there‚Äôs no way I can get around it. My parents know about this but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to kick him out. I don‚Äôt know what to do from here, any advice?	relationship_advice

Contracts are so broken in MyClub it amazes me that they made it past QA	To understand why contracts are so freaking bad in MyClub, you have to understand why they're there in the first place. Contracts, like stamina and team building, are micromanaging gameplay elements designed to keep you with things to do between games. The reason they work in FUT is because the player base has control of the market, they are also given out a lot more generously in packs. This combines to make contracts an element of the game you have to take into consideration while it not really being a major part of the game. In FUT it's possible to give your players contacts for 500 coins or if you were to make 2k for a game roughly 25% of game earnings. This means theoretically if you were to play a game of FUT you could renew 4 players with one game. Doing basic math, if you were to play 10 games of FUT, it would only take 2.5 games roughly to pay for your entire starting 11's contracts. Giving you 7.5 games of profit. This keeps the momentum of the game up and it means you never feel like you can't use certain players or team's because of contracts. **Good game design.** Now for PES, if you have a black ball player you could pay up to 3.5k for a 10 game renewal, you receive between 1-3k for a game depending on you winning or losing plus other elements. Can you see the problem? Let's use the same math as last time with 10 game sample. If I was to play 10 games of PES and in that time 11 starters run out of contract I could pay 30-35k to renew their contracts. Now, if I was to win every single game comfortably, I would be lucky to make a profit, all reality I'm more likely to break even. If I lose a single game then most likely I'm making a loss, if I was to go 7-3 over 10 ranked games, I should come out with a profit right? What makes it even worse, is that, if I was to create a team of crappy, white, bronze and silver players, play them against crappy CPU until their contracts run out then discard them I end up making a 20-30k profit. I played a game against the legend CPU today, just 1 game, I lost, received 1000 GP before being met with 18k of player renewals (6 players) and a 7k manager one. This has completely ruined any momentum I had, I feel like I've been punished for playing the game. The whole system goes against the point of a card collecting football game, your supposed to build your team and upgrade players, in this game I feel it's better to use the worse players. It gets worse, it also goes against their own design philosophy, you encouraged to rank players up, so the fact that it is much more viable source of GP to just play with players and thrown them away makes very little sense. **Bad game design.** The thing is this, it could be fixed so easily. **1st:** Just take them out the game, doesn't really change the core game at all but improves the experience drastically. **2nd:** Make it like 90% cheaper, getting an 18k bill to renew just over half of the team is too much. **3rd:** Every game you receive a contract plus a scout, this means you can stack them and it's not as costly when multiple players run out. I apologise for the rant, this has been annoying me for a while and the 18k just topped it for me, I actually have been really enjoying my time with MyClub as a whole, but the fact that nobody in the design or quality assurance part of the company saw this and flagged it is unbelievable to me.

I looked up a British Youtuber who was busted for sexually coercing/abusing/harassing multiple underage girls a few years ago...	"And he holds a job as a recruitment consultant now. It got me thinking about how men are able to bounce back from their ""indiscretions"", no matter how grave, without so much as a peep from anyone, despite the fact that this guy was on record for having coerced and harassed multiple girls (some as young as 14) into doing sexually inappropriate things when he was a grown man in his 20s. Searching his name alongside his old YouTube handle brings up multiple posts on Tumblr (for some reason, that was the preferred platform for expos√©s back in the day). And yet this guy has faced zero tangible, real world consequences for messing with the lives of these girls/children. He simply deleted his online presence and got himself a job *the same year he was outed*. It's incredible what they get away with."	GenderCritical

Special Ammo Economy needs a tune up, Special weapons don't need nerfs.	I have been seeing a lot of posts asking for nerfs to various special weapons like Bastion, MindBenders, Revoker, Erentils, Joutuun(for some reason) and ofcourse MountainTop. But IMO, special weapons aren't that broken now(Revoker is an exception), sure snipers could use a tune up in AimAssist and Flinch and mountainTop Sticky could be tuned too. But none of these things would stand out this much if Special Ammo wasn't so abundant in this game, hell in most Survival and 6v6 you can pretty much run nothing but you Special the entire round because of how much ammo you get and I have done similar things in Trials too, Special Ammo Economy needs to be toned down, I have a few ideas.. Tweaks to the existing system. *. Instead of 2 ammo, starting ammo should be turned to 1. *. Allied Guardian Deaths shouldn't drop Special Ammo, this way special starvation would be thing If the enemy don't run Specials. *. Max Scavenger pickup should be limited to 2 rounds, not more than that. *. Special Ammo shouldn't carry over to rounds....i don't understand this decision ? Why would you help snowballing in competitive modes ? *. Reviving allies should give them special Ammo.	DestinyTheGame

Why is there no interest on damage deposits?	I alway thought there would be interested added to damage deposits, since I believed they went into the landlord's bank account for holding until being returned to the tenant. I checked out this handy NS gov [calculator](https://novascotia.ca/sns/access/land/residential-tenancies/security-deposit-interest-calculator.asp#calculator) to find out that there is in fact 0% interest since 2013. Does the money go somewhere else, not to the landlord, when you pay it? I thought we email-transferred ours directly to our landlord a few years ago when we moved in. Looking for some clarification, and hoping to learn something new here :)	halifax

Second plot idea. This time about subverting expectations	No overdone revenge plot anymore. - it turns out elli isn't immun against the spore virus. - it just works much slower on her and she is becoming a new form of clicker - she will keep her mind and get the ability to control clickers - she becomes something like the borg queen - she knows instinctively that she needs to go to a specific place - she convinces joel and a few others from tommies settlement that she needs to do this - They go with her to help and protect her - on the way they get into conflict with the seraphites that see every clicker as evil and everyone that isn't them to just as evil because sooner or later everyone will become a clicker - when elli gets to her destination she gets rooted into the ground and becomes the cure for the spore virus - she dies in the process - she wasn't the cure we expected but she was still the cure	TheLastOfUs2

Jagex - can we get a serious response on the poor server performance and your plans on addressing it?	"Between COVID-19, Archaeology, DXP, Mobile/iOS beta, Mod Warden's promises (which are actually coming true) and VERY successful Ninja updates, we might be in a resurgence for RS3. The servers have been choking and I've personally noticed an increased amount of ""dead clicks"" and lack of character responsiveness due to this. Can we hear what the company plans to do to address the poor performance of the servers so they can handle a better load of players? This is not meant to be viewed as any kind of ""got-cha question"" or sarcasm. I'd like to see RS3 become as successful as our friends at OSRS. (I legitimately DO have friends over there)"	runescape

PhD in ML lost on what to do after defending with new disability.	I was planning on going to a FAANG research lab/postdoc, but a severe injury has left me unable to work at the level required for these positions (full research + paper writing + consistent paper reading). I'm shooting for a data science/applied ml job as those concepts are very easy for me to use and apply even in my current state. The issue is my entire CV/experience has been geared towards research with zero production or non-experimental work (my research did make it into FAANG systems by software engineers though). I would really appreciate any input on what type of jobs to look for and any other advice on how to make a transition from a PhD level career -> low end BS/MS positions. I've applied to a number of places these past couple of weeks and I've only had responses/interviews for research level positions which I've had to turn down after finding out.	cscareerquestions

I am not in love with you.	We just fill each other‚Äôs void. I will always accept you. We can only do this together right? I just wish you were happier of a person. I‚Äôm so fun, you‚Äôre so quiet. Opposites attract but I can‚Äôt even talk to you unless you‚Äôve had a drink. I wish we were in love. I wish we could be best friends. It makes me wonder if there‚Äôs someone out there who could take care of me and let me take care of them that I got along with but I know it‚Äôs not worth hurting you over. You‚Äôve already been so hurt. I hope you sleep well. I don‚Äôt hate you. I‚Äôm just not in love with you.	offmychest

If Lebron and Jordan traded careers (e.g., Lebron won 6 rings, 5 MVPs, DPOY, etc., would there even be a GOAT debate?	Everyone in sports media has a recency bias, and we want to believe that the person that we are witnessing is the greatest ever, and the the accomplishments are unparalleled and legendary - greater than previous eras. A lot of people claim Lebron is the GOAT over Jordan despite knowing both sides of accomplishments. But if MJ had Lebron's accomplishments (4x MVP, 3-6 in the Finals) and Lebron had Jordan's (5x MVP, 6-6, DPOY), we wouldn't hesitate a second to call Lebron the GOAT. Just an observation.	nba
To the man who broke my heart	You told me I was too attached to you. I guess I am, but isn‚Äôt it normal to be pretty attached to your husband? Am I supposed to just go about my days as if nothing is different after you leave like you did without even telling me? When you refuse to speak to me or even tell me what you‚Äôre wanting to do? It seems like you‚Äôre capable of just turning off your ‚Äúlove‚Äù for me whenever it‚Äôs convenient and you expect me to just stay on pause until you feel better or decide you‚Äôre ready to come back or whatever or whoever it is you‚Äôre trying to figure out this time. I can‚Äôt force you to care about me but it‚Äôs amazing how you really made me believe that you did care. How I convinced myself what you have showed me is love. It‚Äôs unreasonable for you to expect me not to be emotional or to stop being ‚Äútoo much‚Äù or crazy and whatever else you said to me about how I should be handling your abrupt abandonment of our family. I don‚Äôt want to be more like you with your indifference and your coldness. You‚Äôre off doing whatever you want with no responsibilities in a different place with different people. It‚Äôs so easy for you to forget. I‚Äôm here surrounded by reminders of the life you walked away from. Our family pictures are on the walls and your stuff is still here and I‚Äôve had to look at it every day wondering what the hell you are planning to do. So fuck you. I supported you financially for years and helped you through so much and this is how I‚Äôm treated in the end? I‚Äôm done. I packed all your clothes into boxes and I‚Äôm taking the pictures down today. Apparently you wanted me to detach so now I am. Each day that passes I care a little less and one day soon I won‚Äôt even think of you at all. You‚Äôre always so arrogant about your ability to make me fall back in love with you whenever you want. I know in the past I‚Äôve shown you how easily I fall for your words and I give in to the smallest advances letting you back into my life. This time you‚Äôve finally pushed me away too hard. You‚Äôve been a pretty awful husband when I actually recount all the BS you‚Äôve put me through. But I forgive you and I appreciate the lessons learned from this latest dumping. I will never look to your words again. Your words are vacuous and meaningless. ‚ÄúThe immediate influence of behavior is always more effective than that of words.‚Äù Viktor E. Frankl	UnsentLetters
Why is this a thing?	I bought a ps4 slim earlier this year because all my friends sold their ps3 and it was boring when playing alone... But, after some time when i decided to buy some games, i noticed that i was technically scammed. I need the ps+ thing to play online in the non-free games . Anybody else thinks that this is kinda a scam? I need to pay for a game and then pay for a stupid licence to be able to play the game online? On ps3 when i bought an online-based game i was able to play it right away without the ps+ licence. Why?	PS4

ELI5: How does cosmic inflation increase distances and not just the size of objects?	I don't understand why cosmic inflation results in increasing distances between celestial bodies. If it's a phenomenon that affects all space, because *space itself* is being blown up, shouldn't it also mean that for example the distance between the atoms that make up our bodies, and our telescopes, and the entire earth, would increase too? And if everything gets inflated equally, why would we even notice a difference? Like, if I zoom in on a picture, the *relative* distances between objects doesn't change because everything is magnified equally. But cosmic inflation is explained as *just* the distances increasing while the objects themselves remain unaffected, apparently? Like, where is the limit drawn? Does the distance between earth and moon increase? Earth and sun? Our solar system to others?	explainlikeimfive

I drank again	After being sober for about 8 months I drank again and I didn't like it. There was no desire to keep drinking, I forced myself to keep going to find the joy I used to feel, but I just didn't have it in me to keep drinking. I woke up the next morning feeling like shit and hated that even more. I haven't told my sponsor or any of my friends nor do I intend to and I have no desire to drink again. I also feel like title of alolcohic that I have been using is false now.	stopdrinking

(Repost, looking for a bit more advice) A bit traumatised from an nitrous induced loop on acid, advice or comments?	Had a bad experience with lsd and nitrous and now I‚Äôm finding it hard to stop thinking about it pls help But of a lengthy one sorry, but please help me :( I‚Äôve posted about this before but didn‚Äôt really get the answers I felt I needed and also it was on bicycle day so got a bit lost, so thought I should try again. I did about sorta 120ug my first time doing acid. It was pretty intense for me and I was going a bit insane all night while at this small party. My boyf did a nang (nitrous oxide, whippets and whatever for people who aren‚Äôt Aussie) but yeah he suggested I try it after he had a really good experience where he saw colours but the other he saw demons. I‚Äôll explain the experience but even writing about it is hard and makes me scared. I did the nang and everything was okay in the beginning, but after I stopped breathing into the balloon I was sent into an insanely intense thought loop or just infinite loop in itself. Because the loop I was experiencing was over the realisation that the loop itself is realisation that the loop itself is realisation, it just kept going. As you can see even the sentence is like a loop. The best way I can describe the feeling is with two mirrors facing each other, reflecting each other forever. I know that might be hard to understand but basically I was realising that the loop was me realising... that the loop was me realising that the loop was me realising. Can u see how it can get repetitive???? It was so intense that I couldn‚Äôt see, I forgot I existed, I thought that I was the universe and I was everything. I was terrified because I felt like all there was in the universe was this loop forever and I had to just be this never ending loop. I heard a sound that was like my voice but it didn‚Äôt speak words, and it repeated and looped. I could see myself screaming with my hands on my head, but it was twisted and infinite and my eye was this white star with many points and it sort of twisted into the centre of my vision. My vision just continually twisted and would keep going. Eventually the twisting loops got shorter and shorter and my inside consciousness that was able to be somewhat there during the experience could sense it was building up to something. I felt like the Big Bang was coming and I needed to break free. As it tightened to break free I screamed. I began to come back and I was holding my boyfriends face and he was staring at me terrified. Everyone was so confused and worried because my scream was just unholy. I was sent into something similar to bloody insanity for the rest of the night. Tripped for 15 hours. Kept repeating the understanding of the understanding and realisation of the realisation. Everything is everything and that‚Äôs the loop. Later learned that after I did the nang I also stood up and screamed solidly for about 5 seconds. Then fell to the floor on my knees and screamed again. I also was able to figure out that maybe the screaming face I saw imprinted in my brain because of me screaming during this. I can remember this because of one night where I did mdma. I decided to do some nangs too. When I did the nang, after I came out I realised the same thing happened, obviously less intense. I thought maybe I should do another one, as this is my opportunity to understand the loop. I did a total of 3 nangs, and each time I came out of it with a new piece of information that I could speak and unpack and figure out. Coming out of those nangs was scary. My boyfriend filmed one and the look of fear on my face is unsettling. When I come out I don‚Äôt know where I am, sometimes even who I am. I don‚Äôt know how long it had been. I have to try remember how I got to where I was and what o was doing before. I make assumptions as I come out to try and understand where I am. The intense one I did when I came out, I thought I was my friend (who has some mental health issues) and I had just had a psychotic breakdown. One other time after on md, I thought my boyfriend was telling me I had to come back and we were gonna get in trouble and something happened as when I was coming out I heard ‚Äúare you getting it?‚Äù And didn‚Äôt know what came before. The last time I did it he could see I was scared so he held me and cradled me and said things like please (my name) I love you it‚Äôs okay, and I thought that he was my mum holding me and I just had done something fucked up with drugs at a party and my mum was crying holding me begging me to come back to her while I was curled up on a couch screaming and crying. I wasn‚Äôt. I was lying down on grass in the middle of a field at night. Coming out of those experiences are fucking terrifying. Words like scarred trigger me a little, and when people say oh my god or repeat words escalating in pitch. It just takes me back and scares me. I have a video of when I first did the nang. It‚Äôs so unsettling as you can see where u lose myself. The image I see when on the nang of me screaming in that loop is forever stuck in my brain and I get so unsettled every time I think about it. Also I get the exact same visuals, sounds and thought every time I did those nangs, just to be clear. Or at least I think they were all the same? I don‚Äôt know if I can ever do nangs again. I‚Äôm so much more just scared and on edge. My boyfriend scared me in the car as a joke and I had a scream crying panic attack. I never do that. I‚Äôm scared to sleep. I don‚Äôt know how to stop being so scared all the time. Can anyone please help me unpack this and learn something from it maybe? I just want to stop being so scared of everything and so anxious. I‚Äôm mostly scared when in the dark and by myself though. I still get it around other people. If anyone has had similar experiences, how did you get over it? What did you learn??? Or someone just tell me what they think is happening to me or advice? I‚Äôm getting a bit desperate and trying to overcome the fear I get.	LSD
I dreamt about child pornography and I am absolutely disgusted with myself.	"I play fucking ROBLOX quite often, and in my dream I was doing just that. I saw a new game that seemed interesting, so I played it. The opening screen was this mother forcing her daughter to do unspeakable things to her. I'm not exactly sure if I could've closed out of it or not, but in my dream, this seemed completely normal. I watched and suddenly, a new screen popped up and it was the same mother but the girl was older, maybe in her teens. This time, she actually seemed to enjoy doing these things to her mother. I felt really weirded out watching this, and suddenly, the actual game starts and theres people around me that I know. I ask them like, ""did you guys see the pornography in the beginning?"" and they just laughed and smiled it off, joking about it. But me, I felt guilty and disgusted with myself, and the feeling followed me to real-life. I guess I should tell you guys, but I've seen child porn before. Obviously, not fucking looking for it. But it came to a surprise to me and it was hard to register that kind of stuff. It traumatized me and it really sucks having a dream about this kind of stuff. Anyways, can anyone just tell me what does this mean? tl;dr: dreamt about incest and child porn and i feel very disgusted w myself plz help me"	Dreams
[Spoilers]Is 90 Day Fianc√® like No Sleep? Are we just supposed to pretend it's real?	I like this show, but I just don't know how to approach it. So, we go through this whole thing with David and Lana. We're supposed to believe Lana isn't real: she doesn't talk to him off the pay to chat site, they never speak on the phone (I think?), she never shows up, her picture is on a million websites, etc. Much like with Cesar. And then **WHOOP* there she is!! Did TLC find her and hire her? It makes no sense. But it makes sense if you think about this as a fiction. Was it all made up? Cesar has an acting career and his catfish showed up at the tell all, lots of shock and awe when she showed up at the tell all. What a plot twist! Then the same woman shows up with 90 Day's resident villian, Jesse. And by now it's obvious Jesse is purposefully a bad guy, or a foil, or a heal, whatever. He knows we all (?) hate him, or love to hate him if you're me. But now we have Tom. Two bad guys? Or will Jesse have a character arch and see what happened with Tom and Darcy and come to Darcy's aid? And then Tom will become our new heal. I'm calling it, Williams in some form is going to show up. Maybe the show will dig up the model to tell whatshername that she's being catfished. Is any of it real? Are we just supposed to pretend it's real? What do you do? Am I being pandantic?	90DayFiance
How to remove Ghosting?	Good morning! I have a Rocketbook Everlast (core? whatever) that I absolutely adore, but I'm noticing that it's starting to leave some ghosting behind when I erase. It's about 5 months old and I use it pretty regularly during the work week - I don't often leave notes on the pages for longer than a weeks time, I can say for certain it's never been longer than 2 weeks, so I wouldn't think I should have ghosting issues. It's super faint and not enough to interfere, but enough to annoy me. Does anyone know how to help remove the ghosting? When I clean, I use warm water, microfiber cloth, and clean in circular motions. I also clean the microfiber cloth 1x/week typically (more if I'm erasing a ton of text).	rocketbook
Did teams come to a gentleman's agreement not to stagger babies?	I have no empirical evidence for this, it's just that lately in OWL games, when baby D.Vas are the only ones left alive, instead of stalling them and delaying their deaths as per usual, teams would just finish her off quickly. Just wondering if they reached an agreement not to stagger, or teams just don't find it worthwhile to do so anymore.	Competitiveoverwatch

Why dont AFP and SPA work together or if Olson wins, why doesnt he work with the three	So, an odd thing ive always thought about is why wouldnt AFP and SPA work together on some things, or why wouldnt Olson work with both. Let me explain, so lets say we got Huey boi as President and AFP writes a share our wealth bill which would cap incomes and redistribute wealth, why would SPA vote against it?. Vice versa if Reed boi and SPA propose a bill creating a housing program which gives poor people housing. Why would AFP vote against it, when thats literally a plank in Huey Longs program. Now Olson, an ex wobbly radical progressive, why cant he compromise with both, he probably agrees a lot with Long and a lot with Reed. All three hate Wallstreet. I dont get why the three cant work together.	Kaiserreich

I have the feeling BotW won't age well at all.	A new direction for the series, a beloved game of its time and innovative ideas but its sequel will be able to fix all the rough edges, build upon its foundation, has got more opportunity to focus on its content and flesh out the game-mechanics. The situation reminds me of GTA3. Such a beloved game in its time with a respectable metacritic score of 97. But when Vice City and especially San Andreas released and build upon its foundation there is no reason besides nostalgia to revisit this game. Nearly everything was done better now. Even the fans of this game realized it. Noone is talking about it anymore. I'm so hyped for BotW2. Because I see the *potential* in BotW.	truezelda

My work just got a lot of Matilda Jane in...	So I work at a consignment shop and we get a lot of MLM clothing in (Lularoe, Agnes & Dora, Matilda Jane). Recently, we had this lady who was a trunk keeper for Matilda Jane come and drop off at least two car-fulls of that junk, tags still on it & everything. My boss has mentioned that after we go through it we should live stream all of the pieces we got in. I‚Äôm pretty sure she got this idea from the lady who dropped it all off. On one hand I understand that she would want to do that in order to try to make money & to let people know we have, but on the other hand I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll ask me to do it since I‚Äôm in charge of all our social media pages. Does anyone have any advice on how I should talk to her about this in case she does ask me to do it? We have posted some MJ stuff on our page in the past, but I feel like live streaming all the pieces we have is different.	antiMLM

Putting grip	So I have played now for about 7 years and I feel quite comfortable with my backhand and forehand techniques. I can most often hit the lines I'm looking for and feel quite confident on the teepad. I throw around 400ft RHBH and 320ft FH. My score is still dragging because of a thing that has bugged me almost the whole time. I miss right of the basket while putting. I have re-checked many of the good putting clinics out there in youtube (feldberg, wysocki, Discraft). Sometimes I feel like I have figured out something big and start making the putts, but over time I return to my bad habits and start making the same mistake. Some days I really make the putts and feel confident, but usually I lose somewhere around 5 strokes a round because of misputts. I have tried to narrow down the reason of my misputts. My technique is kind of a mixture of push and spin putts. If I would think of a reference player, maybe Koling.. Some resemblance to McBeth's putting style. I draw my arm in a straight line down to my right knee and then use my left leg to generate power to my putt. Then comes the mysterious problem. I might just randomly miss right for now reason that I would be aware of. I have come to a conclution that I have probably a problem with the timing of the release and I also noticed that my grip is kind of funny. I have most of the pressure between my thumb and index fingers as they are squeezing the rim of my disc, and the other fingers are in a fan position. Do you have some advice on how to grip the putter in a different manner. Where do you have most of the pressure and what do you think about your release timing. What fingers are doing the work, or is it more about opening your wrist? Thank you!	discgolf
Political parties should be disbanded in the US. They literally only serve to divide the people.	First off, I understand that politics are not to be discussed on this subreddit. However, I dont see how this is an issue that regularly is discussed here or even anywhere. This seems to be more of a way of life in the US. So I'll post this and see if it actually makes it through. Im (M 22) only going off of what Ive seen growing up in the US. I have no background in politics or history. I do have a general knowledge of both, but not enough to say I'm an expert in either. With that being said, political parties should be removed in the US. I have seen time and time again where people will take a stance on something only because they pertain to a certain party. There is a herd mentality when it comes to this. Individual opinions are drowned out by the masses in each group. I wholeheartedly believe that most people have ideals that sympathize with more than their own party. I know you can choose to be an independent, and vote for whomever you choose. But thats easier said than done when the government is controlled by only two parties. And how often do you see an Independent candidate make it to the primaries? Rarely, if ever. There is too many individuals that get caught up in the ideologies of where they grew up or who they asscociated with as they created their own ideals. I realize this is easier said than done when thats all you know growing up, but parties dont make it any easier. US citizens need to learn how to genuinely voice their own opinions and not piggy back off of whats seems to be generally accepted by the whole. Stop being sheeple! Its aggravating as hell to see good causes shoved into the dirt because stubborn people want to support their own ideals and only can do so by picking a side. George Washington was worried about political parties hurting a government empowered by the consent of the governed. And now I understand why... There is a divide between us Americans that cannot so easily be mended. United we stand, and divided we fall. And boy we sure have fell. Edit: I dont think Ive thought about this long enough. I still dont think parties work, but ive found a few flaws in my argument. This is obviously ideal and lacks some reality, but the system we have now with two parties controlling the government is not working. Feel free to post how you feel about this.	unpopularopinion

Can Symkevi cause anxiety/depression? (M20)	I started taking Symkevi a few weeks ago, I‚Äôm on 1 twice a week and I feel it‚Äôs made my anxiety, depression, and overall motivation worse. I‚Äôve had mental issues like these for years and got therapy which helped a bit but they feel amplified since I‚Äôve been on Symkevi but it could just be a coincidence, I don‚Äôt know. Also unrelated slightly but I used to have a pretty high libido and now I hardly ever feel like doing anything sexual, I even struggle to get erections and if I do I lose them pretty fast. I was going to make an appointment with the doctors but they are only phone appointments because of Coronavirus. I have a clinic appointment in a couple of weeks with my CF team but I feel to embarrassed to bring it up with them as I see them regularly, I‚Äôd rather see a doctor about it who I won‚Äôt know for the rest of my life.

The Evil of Intellectual Monopoly	"""Economists and decent citizens alike are suspicious of monopoly. There are many good reasons for this. The traditional economic analysis of monopoly emphasizes the ‚Äúwelfare triangle‚Äù‚Äì the loss of efficiency due to the fact that monopolies create artificial scarcity in order to garner a higher price. More recent economic analysis emphasizes ‚Äúx-inefficiency‚Äù ‚Äì that monopolies use inefficient and excessively costly methods of production. .. *There is yet another reason to be wary of monopolies* ‚Äì *in order to transfer wealth away from the rest of society and toward themselves they must prevent entry.* The easiest way to achieve this is to stifle innovation. This blocks productivity growth thereby reducing overall prosperity. It is a different and arguably more pernicious source of social inefficiency.""

We have to talk about Linus	Whenever I search ¬´ Linus ¬ª on this subreddit, I only find people who praise him as he is the best character in video game history. I can‚Äôt understand that. Indeed, I hate Linus at a level you can‚Äôt even imagine. He is a hermit, living in a tent by choice and always playing the victim for that. He allows himself to dig in trashs, to say he will not do it again, and to do it right after. Also, Mr Linus happens to be picky af about the gifts we offer to him. Indeed, while he lives next to a lake in the mountain, he doesn‚Äôt like fish, doesn‚Äôt like some of other food, and will even complain. Like mate, you‚Äôre struggling to find food, we give some to you, and you criticize us of giving you food? Wtf? Just say thanks and that‚Äôs it. But the worst part happens during night. Every nights, Linus is spying everyone and if someone is by misfortune outside of his bed by 2 AM, he fucking knocks them out, steals their money (like 5k because that‚Äôs ok) and some of their items (and yes, of course that can be a sword costing 25k). And after that, HE WANT US TO THANK HIM FOR SAVING US. How is this even possible. And all of that happen in the street, in the mountain, in the 120th level of the mine or next to your bed. HOW? I could write a book about how bad is Linus and how much I hate him. Unlike other video game villains, he doesn‚Äôt have any talent or abilities. He is just a thief and an agressor. To conclude : Fuck you Linus. Also, please tell me why you love Linus, so I can try to understand.	StardewValley

"flight operated by ""X"" airline: which company buy from?"	Hello! I'm looking to buy a ticket from MAD-DFW. It's direct, so that seems to give me some sense of security. I've been able to find the flight through several different airlines (American, Finnair, and Iberia), yet all make a note that they are being operated by American airlines. Prices are similar for all of the flights. So I'm wondering who I should buy from? If it does get cancelled, would it be more safe to have bought the ticket through the American? Also, what does this mean when one company is operating all of the flights? thank you!	Flights

Pure Madra path benefits	I was thinking about different paths and it got me thinking that so far we haven't see that many benefits of a pure madra path or any particular reason Eithan would choose one. Benefits: * Easy on the channels allowing a lot of madra to be put into techniques * Has a soothing effect on Lindons channels after blackflame * Powerful for nullifying striker techniques Drawbacks: * No ruler technique/weak to ruler techniques * Doesn't have the best enforcer techniques (although Eithan says this Lindons seems pretty good) * Doesn't have much in the way of attacks (Either shatter their core with a striker technique or disrupt them a bit, no inbetween) * No defensive capabilities apart from striker attacks From Uncrowned it seems that the Aurelius clan specialises in storm and lightning based paths matched with their extraordinary sight; Eithan who gives the impression of being a long lost scion from the Aurelius main line seems to be on a weaker path. Obviously most of Lindon's focus has been on blackflame but he would be a shadow of the sacred artist he is if he only had a pure path. While Eithan is a very powerful underlord that seems to be down to his iron body, large core and excellent command over bloodline powers rather than his path at all, arguably he would be a lot more successful with a different path. So it got me thinking that pure madra might be more of a 'late game build' while BlackFlames are a deadly threat at copper maybe Pure madra paths don't start seeing their benefits until Archlord+. The counterpoint being that none of the higher advancements seem too fussed about his path or future advancement. Could be because I'm blatantly wrong or maybe there hasn't been a pure madra sage/herald so people aren't aware.	Iteration110Cradle
Weekly Discussion Thread (May 11th, 2020)	"Welcome to [r/Liberal\_Conservatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal_Conservatives)! what's on your mind? \----------------------------------------------------- **INTRODUCTION:** Liberal conservatism incorporates the classical liberal view of minimal government intervention in the economy. However, liberal conservatism also holds that individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions. As a user once said: ""Liberal conservatism is liberal means to conservatism. I.E. more personal freedom in society and freedom of government creates the most social stability."" We welcome all who wish to learn and share our ideology of kindness! **WHY WE DO THIS?**: To harbor discussion, boost activity, and generate awareness on the topic of Liberal Conservatism, we have decided to create weekly discussion threads to accomplish these goals.

seeking out martyrdom is not holy at all	"I used to be non-denominational and then my mom got divorced and remarried a Catholic man and we all converted. I sit on the edge of Catholicism, agreeing with some of it, but struggling with other parts. One part I am sure of though, is that seeking out your death for God isn't right. I've read and heard so many stories of saints who actively wanted to die for God, as in, they seemed to seek it out, or literally tortured themselves during life in order to die for him. but if they were really following what God had taught, wouldn't they be able to do his commandments better alive? If God wants you to serve others and spread the word, dying will just end your life and the few people that your gruesome death would inspire don't really seem like the kind of people who wouldn't just do the same as you, and die too, since it kinda screams, ""hey follow God, and you too can die in the arena!"" Of course, following any religion can be dangerous, that's a different topic. What I'm saying is that if you want your own faith to grow and inspire others, isn't it better to show them through your life? A real martyr isn't someone who seeks death for their cause, but who would be willing to lay down their life if they had to."	unpopularopinion

Advice on Rebuilding Sense of Security	My husband and I have been married for 3.5 years and from the outset, chose the Venn diagram model for finances: personal accounts and then a shared one for mutual expenses. I was never a huge fan of the idea: I thought it was fine to have personal accounts but that the majority of funds should be combined. My husband felt differently. Fast to yesterday when there was a catalyst for me to bring up my discomfort with our financial arrangement. We both make good salaries‚Äîbut my husband makes more than 2.5x what I make and contributes only a little more to our shared fund, keeping most of it private. It finally came out that he has a fear that I will leave him and doesn‚Äôt want to be left with nothing. This was devastating to me‚Äîan indictment on our trust, in addition to casting a shadow of ‚Äúself-fulfilling prophecy‚Äù on our marriage. But most of all, it was confirmation that there is deep insecurity for both of us about our marriage. So my question is this: we both recognize this insecurity and want to repair it. Have you experienced this? What did you do to improve it?	Marriage

The Ishval war arc should also be an episode longer, the Dublin arc should have an episode in plus as well , the Envy vs Ling and Lan Fan + Hohenheim scene with the robers should have been added too.

TIFU by buying super tampons	For background, I Always buy the same brand of Kotex U light tampons. Never had any issues. All was always well. And for TMI details, my period was finishing off, so lighter than usual but not quite finished. So yesterday I go to pee and realize I‚Äôm out of tampons. So I rush over to the store and buy the same package that I always buy, or so I thought. I open up the package and all of the tampons are in green wrappers, rather than the usual pink, blue and purple. ‚ÄúOdd‚Äù I think, but don‚Äôt bother to read the package. So I stand up, go to insert the tampon, and it felt like it stabbed me. (I didn‚Äôt get it in) ‚ÄúOW!‚Äù I scream. My boyfriend runs over and asked what is wrong. I told him that my tampon hurt me, he said that was weird and to try it again. So I guide the tampon in gently, and everything is fine. Or so I thought. I sit down on the couch and I can FEEL the tampon inside of me. It HURTS and is very uncomfortable. (You typically DONT really notice the tampon inside you) So now I‚Äôm thinking, WTF. I go and look at the package of tampons. There plastered on the front is the word ‚ÄúSUPER‚Äù fuck. I super fucked up, I never use super, and ESPECIALLY not when my period is barely there. So I go into the bathroom to take it out because I‚Äôm so uncomfortable and.... I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs stuck and it hurts like an absolute bitch. I run out into the living room with my pants around my ankles and a look of horror on my face. My boyfriend asks what‚Äôs wrong and I tell him I have a bloody super tampon stuck in me that hurts to take out. (Pun intended) So there I am in the living room trying to gently remove this tampon. Each little pull of movement BURNS in my vagina. It hurts SO BAD. My boyfriend tries to help and keeps asking if I want him to ‚Äújust pull it out.‚Äù ‚ÄúNO‚Äù I scream. After entirely way too long, I finally remove it from myself. And now the inside of my vagina feels like it has carpet burn. Joy. TL;DR - bought super tampons and one got stuck inside of me and now my vagina hurts	tifu

AOOs through an ally	Simple and quick question: Can I attack enemies that provoke aoo if there's an ally between them and me, if I have enough reach to hit them? I ask this because in the manual, they say that you can't hit them if they have cover: Cover and Attacks of Opportunity You can‚Äôt execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you. However, creatures give SOFT cover to other creatures: Soft Cover Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Stealth check So I need to have [Phalanx Formation](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/phalanx-formation-combat/) to attack them with an aoo?

Seriously dont stick anything up your arse (Girls and Guys)	I recently got an object stuck up my arse due to me using it as a masturbation tool. I've recently been going through a phase. So dont stick anything up your arse, seriously unless it's an actual sex toy which you know is safe. I had to tell my parents and ended up in the Emergency Department during a global fucking pandemic and now my parents think I'm retarded which is lovely (sorry if that word offends you I'm just using it in my frustration so please forgive me) Thats my moral lesson for today. Girls don't stick anything up your vagina either that you don't have a good hold on. Guys and Girls nothing up the ass except a dick or toy. Peace. Edit 1: If any bisexual or gay teens read this can I ask you some questions? Im questioning at the moment thus the object stuck up my arse.	teenagers

[Guide] Neverland Casino Slots 2020 - Level 200 or 300	*This guide is based on the format used in multiple previous guides made by* [***u/Mikazah***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mikazah/) &#x200B; **Overview** The offer 'Neverland Casino Slots 2020' is based on an app for both Android and iOS that allows users to play slots with chips. The offer required me to reach level 300 in the app. The game is as stated in it's name, slots gameplay. This offer is quite easy to automate and you spend little time actually doing something in the app. &#x200B; Be aware there's two versions of this offer, one is to reach level 200 and one is to reach level 300. I did the 300 one and it took me roughly 72 hours, I believe it's possible to complete the level 200 one in less than 24 hours. &#x200B; Also be aware this guide is based on what I did to complete the offer, there might be other and better ways to optimize it further and I also can't guarantee this method will work for you as slots offers are somewhat random, based on what rewards you receive from cases, lucky wheels and other bonuses. And of course what you win from playing the slots will also factor in. &#x200B; **Details** |Offer name|Neverland Casino Slots 2020| |:-|:-| |Offerwalls|AdGem & AdGate Media| |OS|iOS & Android| |Countries that has the offer (that I'm aware of)|US, CA, UK, DE, SE, NO, AT, AU, ES, FR, IT, ZA, NL| |Amount|Depends on the site you use, offerwall, OS & country. **I got $15.75**| |Time Limit|12 Days on AdGem| |Time Spent|Hands on \~2 hours. \~72 Hours idle.| &#x200B; **How to play & Tips** Here's the exact recipe I suggest you follow based on my own experiences. Use an iPad/Tablet or a spare phone if possible, so you can leave it running constantly without interruption. &#x200B; The first thing to do when you jump into the game is to collect all the free chips you can, Facebook login and clicking links from their social media (didn't work for me, but I've heard others say it works for them). Also check if you've received any wCases (bottom bar) that you can open. After collecting all the free chips, start playing slots. Jump into one of the slots that offers auto-spin and don't require you to hit any button when you get free spins. Examples of these are 'Great Grizzly' and 'Temple of the Jaguar' when you get to a higher level. Also if you can, try to find out which slot has the lowest re-spin time as you want to make as many spins as possible within the least time. You're gonna want to start betting with the smallest amount possible, 10K. As you bet you will start gaining rewards, this can be anything from XP boost to wCases and chips. The start will require you to monitor your rewards for a bit. If you get wCases I suggest opening them straight away as you can hold a max of 3 at the same time. &#x200B; Once you reach level 50 you will receive a 24 hour double XP boost. This will be crucial to use moving forward as it will speed up the level process a lot. You shouldn't take very long to reach level 50 even with minimum bets. After you've received the XP boost you should check how many chips you've got and scale your bets accordingly. According to the games FAQ this will make you level up faster. &#x200B; >If you want to level up faster, there are a couple of things you can do: > >Spin more frequently, or try higher bets &#x200B; Personally I didn't see a big difference in the movement of the XP bar when doing higher or lower bets, but I'll trust their word for it. Here's how I would scale my bets, I did it in a way that I didn't have to monitor it very often, you can probably put the bets higher if you want to speed it up further, but that will require you to monitor it more often to make sure you don't lose it all. &#x200B; |0-2M Chips|10K Bets| |:-|:-| |2-5M Chips|20K Bets| |5-10M Chips|50K Bets| And you can scale it further the more chips you've got. &#x200B; Now you just let it idle for a while and check back every 10 levels maybe to see if you get any case drops & to scale up or down the bets. Also remember to check back in every hour to open the hourly case you've received. &#x200B; Once you reach level 100 you're gonna want to stay around as this will give you a medium case which can gift you plenty of chips, open it and go back to spinning. From level 101-199 the rewards are really lacking when it comes to cases and the XP bar will slow down, so you don't have to check in as often. You'll also want to check in when you reach level 200 as it gives you the best wCase for you to open. Personally I have never ran out of chips, the lowest I've been is 500k with minimum bets running, which is when I decided to try 'Journey' game mode. &#x200B; If you feel that you're about to run out of chips, go ahead and go to the 'Journey' section. This is a game mode that lets you play certain slots for a certain amount before you can move on to the next one and receive rewards between. I would jump into the slot and just spam the screen with my finger to speed up the spinning process, then I'd immediately go onto the next one when it was unlocked and collect the reward between them. Rinse and repeat, only did it for like 30\~ minutes as the rewards weren't very good unless you got lucky with a wCase. I've gotten a couple of wCases from the rewards, so if you're about to run out of chips this can be a way to get back on track. &#x200B; When you're about to sleep, just leave the app running on auto-spin with the lowest bet amount possible. When you wake up in the morning, go ahead and open the 3 cases you've received while you slept and keep spinning afterwards. &#x200B; This is all I did to personally finish the offer in 72\~ hours with a total hands-on time probably less than 2 hours. My 24 hour XP boost ran out when I had reached level 210, so I think I covered a pretty good distance. &#x200B; I'd also suggest leaving notifications on for the app, so you get notified about morning or evening bonuses you can claim. Also the 2nd day of playing you get to spin the lucky wheel twice a day, this will also be a nice bonus. The bonus wheel starts automatically when you enter the app if you're eligible for it. &#x200B; I also think it's possible to complete the offer by being completely idle after level 50 or 100. This will probably require you to do minimum bets or close to minimum and it will take a bit longer. &#x200B; **How to get more chips** * You get a free case every hour that can get you more chips. * Connect your Facebook to get 1M chips. (Might not be necessary) * Open cases you get from leveling up. * Enable notifications so you can get the free lucky wheel spins twice everyday. * Play the 'Journey' game mode and collect rewards. * Their social media has tons of links you can click to get more chips (Didn't work for me, they just take me to the developers home page, but worked for some people apparently), just scroll down a bit and you'll get to the posts. &#x200B; **Should you spend real money?** With the amount of free chips out there to grab, I don't think it's necessary to spend real money. &#x200B; **Can I speed it up further?** Yes, the more you bet, the more XP you get (According to their FAQ). I went the safe route and maximized the amount of XP I got from my chips without taking too much risk. If you increase the total bet you will get XP quicker, but you might also need more chips in-case you go on a losing streak and lose it all. Safest is what I recommend, but feel free to test collecting all kinds of rewards and starting of on a higher bet amount. It's also entirely possible that I missed out on certain features in the app or didn't find other ways to earn more chips. &#x200B; Any feedback or thoughts on the guide? Any additional things I should include?	beermoney

Succesful Nebido story	Currently in the last few days of my third 1.000mg testosterone undecenoate (Nebido) shot. The protocol that my doctor has prescribed me is a 1.000mg shot every 7 weeks. That is around 142 mg of testosterone every week. Before I have used Androgel with no succes. Just a slight increase in libido but no morning wood. Fatigue was still present. The reason i started TRT in the first place is because of low libido, no morning erections, social anxiety, concentration issues (i was diagnosed with ADHD when i was 8 years old). Currently testing wether i have Klinefelters syndrome or not. Nebido works truly amazing for me. You have to be patient with it because the first shot did little to nothing for me. But right when i took the second shot i experienced the benefits for around 2/3 weeks. Now I am on my third shot and I experienced the benefits for almost fully 6 weeks. I experienced these benefits from TRT: \- I lost some bodyfat, but that is also from being in a caloric deficit. \- All my fatigue problems are gone! I dont need a nap anymore around 4 pm. That changed my lifestyle a lot! \- Everyday morning wood. Every. Day. \- Very high libido. I get horny around 4-5 times a day. \- Harder erections. My girlfriend also told me that my penis appears bigger when erect. \- Some increase in beard growth. The hair on my cheeks is also thicker. I know people have bad experiences with Nebido. That is because the standard protocol of 12 weeks. The optimal protocol for most people is around 6-7-8 weeks, though i dont recommed the 6 weeks protocol. It builds up a lot of testosterone on the long run -> long term problems. Feel free to ask my any questions regarding my TRT experience! I live in The Netherlands by the way so Sustanon, Androgel & Nebido are my only options.	Testosterone
Upgrading my bike, had a few questions	Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôve had this Diamondback Axis SE for 4 years now and I‚Äôm weighing my options between buying a new bike and upgrading this one. Had a few questions to see if I want to do is feasible and makes economic sense. Currently have a Suntour front fork, 100mm of travel. Wanted to upgrade the front fork and increase the travel. How much extra travel could I get away with? 120? 130? 140? Want to change my gearing from a 3x8 to a 1x9. Would I need a new derailleur too? Or just a new cassette on the back and use one of the front gears as well. And with that, I imagine I‚Äôd need a new shifter for the 9 gears as well? Appreciate the help!	MTB

My old friends are all addicted to drugs, in jail, or dead. So I'm super alone most of the time. my new friends recently turned out to be fake and slandered me behind my back. That's my fault because I knew the kind of people they were and I just kept giving them chances and telling myself they'd turn around. Go figure they didn't. I'm just super lonely and sad and I'm frustrated that I let myself get manipulated. I hate that I'm alone and I hate how I'm struggling over my past. I honestly wish I could just disappear. I have no one to vent too right now and I'm just experiencing so many emotions. I'm tired of being like this. üò¢üò°	Vent

New addition to the quiver, need advice	Hey guys, I want to add a new pair to the quiver.Right now I have the Atomic Vantage 95 (192cm) as my do it all ski. When it gets really deep I usually rent some powder skis. For next season I wanted to buy a new pair to shred the groomers. Like a race/carver ski. My profile: \- weight: 95kg / 210pounds \- height: 197cm / 6ft4 \- I like to go fast and charge hard at times, just cruise around and enjoy the views at others. \- Been skiing for 30 years, last few years I average 15 skiing days/year I was thinking about buying the Rossignol React R8 Ti ([https://www.snowmagazine.com/ski-gear/955-skis/rossignol-react-r8-ti-2019-20](https://www.snowmagazine.com/ski-gear/955-skis/rossignol-react-r8-ti-2019-20)) the longest 182cm version I was wondering if this is a good choice, or if I am better off buying something that requires more power and concentration like world cup rebels or something along those lines. I am afraid these ski's might be too easy/boring? Or will they keep being fun to take out, and challenge me enough? Does anyone have any experience with these? Any other suggestions I can look at are also welcome.	skiing
New watcher	Okay I liked TWD till about season 5/6 when it just got repetitive snd boring imo so decided to watch this and I love Alycia Carey as an actress so gave this a go Im on episode 3 and im just confused lol. I love Nick, he‚Äôs my favoriteüò© hope he lasts for a while. But anyways im just confused why no one tells other people whats going on in the first couple episodes?? Like alicia still doesnt know seems bad since it could effect her safety.. and weird acting here and there and also travis annoys the hell out of me for some reason lmao But does the show get better?

Why don't we go to the future?	This game is 100.1% following another version of the same game (JP) , so why the GL doesn't go directly to the future(JP). What I like this way, is that we won't know what the future is hiding. Instead of currently seeing how JP is doing and we know where GL will fall. Most games gone with the thier original JP or KR.

Is it someone new? If so, here is the perfect way to experience the Bioshock experience! + answers regarding to some games	As someone who loves the Bioshock franchise, I really want to give a helping hand to those who are relatively new to the series, so they can experience the full potential of the Bioshock franchise. I STRONGLY, STRONGLY recommend to buy the Bioshock Collection (especially when it is on sale, it is the most worth grab ever during Steam sale), as it includes all 3 bioshock games, as well as their remastered versions (Infinite does not have a remaster). It also includes Bioshock 2's DLC, as well as Infinte's 3 DLC plus the Season pass (gives you extra gear at the start of the game). Well, what's the best way to experience Bioshock? Here is the order of games you should play (isn't my opinion, most of the community agrees with this too) in order to experience it fully: 1. Bioshock 1 2. Bioshock 2 3. DLC - Bioshock 2: Minerva's Den 4. Bioshock Infinte 5. DLC - Bioshock Infinite: Burial At Sea (Episode 1 + Episode 2) 6. Replay - Bioshock 1 (you'll know why after Burial At Sea) You can play Bioshock Infinte: Clash in the Clouds any time, as it is not a story, but an arena/wave based game. You may ask: Do I need to follow this order? Well you don't really have to. You can actually play all of these games separately, because none of these games especially Bioshock Infinte will require the knowledge of an its prequel to understand the plot (except Burial At Sea, you must play Bioshock 1 in order to understand Burial At Sea). But I will whole-heartedly recommend to follow this order. What about Bioshock 2? I heard a lot of people saying that game is bad and not worth playing! Nope, the people who say that can shove it up their ass. Ok seriously why is Bioshock 2 not as good as the others? And what is the controversy surrounding it? So Bioshock 1 and Bioshock Infinte both have the same writers Ken Levine, but Bioshock 2's writer is not Ken Levine, which leads to fans speculating it is not canon with the rest of the games. Bioshock Infinite also does not acknowledge Bioshock 2's existence, which lead to even more controversy. Is Bioshock scary? To some maybe, I heard some people saying how the splicers in the first Bioshock creep them out, but personally I wasn't scared of it. Which is the best Bioshock game? There is no answer to this. For example, if you ask what is the best MCU film, you can't give an answer to which one is the best. There might be a favourite one, but there won't be the best one. Instead, I will give you the pros and cons of each game. These are not opinions made by me, but rather what the general community thinks: Bioshock 1: Best villain, best enemy design Bioshock 2: Worst story, best gameplay, best level design Bioshock Infinite: Best story (also most confusing one, it is the Inception of gaming), worst gameplay, best sidekick ever in gaming history (Elizabeth), saddest ending Are there multiple endings? Bioshock 1 has 3 endings (two bad, one good), Bioshock 2 has 6 endings (2 bad, 2 neutral, 2 good), Bioshock Infinte only has one ending. IMPORTANT: In Bioshock 1 and 2, you will get an option to either harvest or rescue the Little Sisters. Please, please don't harvest them. Do yourself, me and the community a favour. You will get a very bad ending, and you probably don't want a bad ending. Thank you for reading this post, and I hope you find this post helpful. The Bioshock franchise is argubaly the best FPS shooter franchise ever made, so I really want people to experience it at its maximum potential.	Bioshock

Survival (Day 1 : Part 2)	Walking from edge of the forest a ‚ÄúDeer‚Äù like creature moved toward us. I say ‚ÄúDeer‚Äù like creature because it at first glance resembled said animal. At first glance. Once you really looked at it then you saw the difference from a Deer and this animal. The head was similar to that of a deer but, the massive spread of antlers were far too extensive to be that of a deer. How it moved through the thick forest with that spread, I did not know. Next difference was the front legs. Thin like a deer‚Äôs, but longer. It shouldn‚Äôt be just walking towards us. Any normal animal would have run the moment it saw us. Instead it was walking calmly in our direction. It was taller than a deer, but with the same elegant stride. It reached us and continued through giving us no mind. I noted as it got closer that there were more differences to this creature and a Deer. This animal had not one, but two pairs of hind legs. It made its way through us and moved on toward the far end of the clearing. Where it stopped at the edge of the wood, looked about then leaped high in the air and disappear into the woods. For a good ten to fifteen minutes we stood there looking after the animal, that had just walked through us. Too stunned to say anything. Then Someone breathe out, ‚ÄúDid you see the rack on that deer?‚Äù With that the spell was broken and everyone turned to me. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù was the thought everyone had. For about an hour after that, myself and several others made the trip to the river. We were not sure what else to do. I had decide to just start gather my flint like rocks so that I could make tools. RJ and some of the people continued to work on the shelter. What else could we do. I had made three trips, when Sergeant Samuel and her group appeared through the hole in the bushes we had made. In her hand dangled a rabbit like animal. She waved at me. I dropped the load I was carrying, and jogged over. ‚ÄúI just walked up to it. It didn‚Äôt even try to run away? I was able to just reach down and kill it. What the hell is going on? It should have been afraid of us, but nothing. I only saw a few animals. I also noted something too.‚Äù Samuels side as I approached. She stepped to one side and let her group through. Some of them had different berries and small animals. The berries looked like some kind of Blueberries, but the wrong color of blue. ‚ÄúAre the berries good to eat?‚Äù I asked. A woman with dreadlocks spoke up, ‚ÄúI saw the rabbit animals eating them, so they should be OK to eat.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that for sure. So be careful,‚Äù I warned. ‚ÄúWell, if I get sick that should tell us something,‚Äù she replied. I groaned inwardly, but indicated the camp. ‚ÄúFind a clear spot to put the food down,‚Äù I instructed, then turned to Srg. Samuel. ‚ÄúWhat did you note?‚Äù I asked. She watched as everyone filed past her then spoke. ‚ÄúThe animals are not afraid of us, but they are afraid of something.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat did you see, to make you think that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI saw one of the local birds on our way around. I saw it before it saw us. When it heard us approaching it started to go higher into the trees, but then it saw us it stopped and moved back down to get a better look at us. I swear it was the oddest thing I've ever seen. Well how the bird acted, then again I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt see a bird like that before too. Anyhow, the behavior of the animals is strange. I can't explain, but here is something that is scaring the wildlife. It could be regular predators, but I think it‚Äôs something more. There is something else out there, I‚Äôm certain of it.‚Äù I told her about the deer animal and I thought about what she had said. A little later Tim, Rebecca, and their group exited the forest near to where Srg. Samuels had entered. They were laden down with pear like fruit. Tim had a dead bird grasped in his hand. He explained that they had discovered the ‚ÄúPear‚Äù Tree not far from the north edge of the woods, there was a small grove of the trees. Also that there were quite a few birds living in them. I told Samuel and him about the river and the strange fish. Tim wanted to go see the river and Samuel decided to go to. I took them down our rough path and showed them the river. We arrived just as Mama Fisher and Sheila pulled a big fish from the water. They had a few fishes piled behind them. Mama Fisher called to us as we approached. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had it this easy catching fish before. If I knew this place existed I would have come sooner.‚Äù Tim and Samuel looked up and down the river, inspecting the bank ‚ÄúHave you explored very far either way?‚Äù Srg. Samuel asked. Sheila spoke up, ‚ÄúI started to, but came back to help Mama F.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need to. I don‚Äôt know what resources are around here but we are going to need to find what we can.‚Äù Srg. Samuel stated. Then added, ‚ÄúIt is getting a little late.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe should take back what you have here. We‚Äôve got a good amount of food, and we need to start fires so we can cook.‚Äù I interjected. Everyone agreed and we began to gather up the fish. I had gathered up a armful of fish when I looked across the river. I was able to duck just in time as one of the Six legged deers leaped from one side of the river to the other. It Rushed over me and crashed landed six or seven feet past me. It jumped to its feet and rushed off into the forest. We looked after it for a second then looked back across the river. A group of strange bipedal three foot tall, scaly animals spilled out of the trees on the other side. All I really saw were their big head‚Äôs full of pointed teeth. They rushed down to the water‚Äôs edge and slid to a stop, seeming unwilling to go into the water. They chirped and hooted at each other, and stared across the water at us. Very quietly Tim whispered, ‚Äúeveryone back away slowly. Don‚Äôt make any sudden moves.‚Äù We slowly began to back away, the short velociraptor looking creatures watched us their long tails moving back and forth. We made it to the edge of the woods and scooted over to the hole in the brush we created. The whole time the toothy critter watched us with unblinking eyes. Slowly we retreated down the path till we were out of site. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll,‚Äù I said softly, ‚ÄúI think we found what the other animals are afraid of.‚Äù Mama F breathed out, ‚ÄúDid you see the teeth on those kani‚Äôa?‚Äù Sergeant Samuel stared back the way we came and replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what those monsters are but I think we're going to need to make slight change to our survival plans.‚Äù We gather everyone together once we arrived back at camp and explained what we had seen. Everyone asked what we were going to do about this threat? The only thing I could think of was to build a wall round our camp and hope the predators couldn‚Äôt jump. Also I was starting to feel glad I had gather some of the flint like rocks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need to build defensive's, for now wooden wall‚Äôs to keep the predators out. If anyone knows how to flint knap come help me work on some flint tools. Everyone else needs to stay close to camp. Don‚Äôt wander off alone. If you need to go out into the woods go in groups. We still need more wood and stuff for fire.‚Äù I indicated the man I had put in charge of wood gathering. ‚ÄúHow much have we gathered?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWe should have enough gathered to last all night. But if we have to start using it for other stuff it won't last long.‚Äù I thought about that for a second. ‚ÄúOK, we need to start getting fires going. Everyone who know how to start a fire need to do so. I‚Äôll start on making flint tools. We need people to keep a lookout. Four or five people need to go back down to the river and keep an eye out there. If you think you see any of the creatures get back here ASAP. We‚Äôll try and be ready for them.‚Äù Everyone went to it. Myself, Edward, and three other people sat down with our stones and began to work on them. I got the flint like stone a little longer than my hand. With harder stone began to carefully chip at the flint stone. It was harder to do then with regular flint but I seemed to get the same result. I keep the chips that came off, I could use them for other stuff later. Chip by chip I began forming my ax head. It took at least a hour to do one ax, in which time Mama F and some others had gone back to the river. Not seeing our little friends she and other gathered up the dropped fish. They brought them back and I gave them some of the flint chips so that they could cut and clean out the fish. Our firewood gatherer, Stefen, had brought us some branches so that we could make handles for our axes. While I and the others began making more ax heads, Edward took the branches and stripped them of bark. Taking two stones, one with a point and one to use to hit the pointed one, he began to chisel out a slot that our ax heads could fit in. Doc Bitterbeer had, as he had said he would, taking the bushes we had cut and began making twine with them. When he had gotten eight of them made he gave them to Edward. Edward in turn took the finished ax heads and put one into the slot he had made in a branch and use the twine to secure the ax head to the branch. All that work for just one ax. Edward gave the ax to one of the people helping RJ. That person took the ax and began chopping at a small tree for better wood, to make better shelters. For the rest of the day we made tools. RJ and his group erected shelters. Mama F and six or seven people made trips to the river, guarded by Sergeant Samuel. Tim and Rebecca cleared the brush near to were the ‚ÄòPear‚Äô trees were. Giving Doc more fiber to work with. Tim and Rebecca gathered more of the fruit. A man named Alexander, had began making fire pits and starting fires. Wisely he had lined the fire pits with stones. Mama F had started preparing the fish for eating, once Alexander had the first fire going she took over and began cooking the fish on flat stones. By that time we were sure the berries were safe to eat , the woman with the dreadlocks, Diane, had not gotten sick so we were fairly sure they were good too. All told we had enough food to barely feed all of us. Sergeant Samuel had taking a rough head count, there was about four hundred and six people. Both jet planes must have been fully loaded to take all of us. RJ would not have enough shelters make by night fall so most of us would have to sleep on the ground. With the local insect not bothering us it might not be too bad. The biggest concern was the water. Could we safely drink it? Two of the people with Mama F group had drank some water, and so far they seemed fine. But it was too soon to be sure. I was becoming very parched, and so were others. We might have to risk it, soon. As the sun began to set, my hands were cramped, I had smashed my finger multiple times, my back ached from being hunched over, but in return we had between the five of us had made 10 axes, four spear heads, and three knives. Stefan had not found branches long enough for the spears, because RJ and use so many to make shelters. We would have to wait for the morning to get one of the axes and chop some branches or small trees to make the spear shafts. Mama F gave me a flat stone with a chunk of fish, two slices of the ‚ÄòPears‚Äô (which were fairly hard and tasted like a mix of pear and peaches), also I got a hand full of light blue blueberries ( the tasted like blueberries with a tangy after flavor), and a little of the ‚Äòrabbit‚Äô meat. All in all not a filling meal, but the Fish tasted good, so not a total bummer. Mama F came by a little later with shallow rock with water in it. ‚ÄúI heated up this water, hopefully its safe to drink.‚Äù She said offering me a drink. I drank a little, the hot water tasted like cooked fish and berries, not the normal flavor I like my water. I thanked her and drank a little more, and she moved on to other people. Before trying to lie down for the night I went and found Staff Sergeant Samuel. She had appropriated one of the axes and was keeping watch on the east side of the clearing. ‚ÄúAnything to report,‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo. After first interaction, we haven‚Äôt seen tooth or scale of the little monsters. They could be just inside the treeline for all we know or they could be miles from here. We just don‚Äôt know,‚Äù She said watching the path. ‚ÄúThey seemed hesitant to cross the water. So hopefully they'll not cross over just yet.‚Äù Srg. Samuel glanced side long at me and replied, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll I‚Äôm not going to assume that their not going to cross. We‚Äôll be prepared in any case. I won't feel safe till we at least have a wall between, us and those creatures.‚Äù I nodded in agreement and watch with her till the sun set. I woke sometime in the middle of the night to something I haven't heard since I was a little kid camping with my family in Yellowstone National Park. The long howl drifted on the wind from somewhere far off. It waxed and waned for several minutes. Finally it died down, and it went quiet. I wonder if I could fall back to sleep, with my nerves so unsettled. Then just at the edge of my hearing range from the south came answering howls. Not just one voice, but many. It was too far away for me to make anything out for sure, but there were many different pitches and were held for different amounts of time. Almost everyone was up now listening to the howls. Shocked and pail faces looked at each other. The only thing I knew for sure was without a doubt those were wolf howls. I will never forget the sound of wolves howls. That night, long ago were my brother and I and our parents sat in our camper as a pack of wolves sat not far from us and howled was seared into my memory. Where ever we were there were wolves out there. It almost almost made me believe we were still somewhere at home. That is until I looked and saw many people looking up into the night sky. I looked up too. There sitting in the sky was A moon. Not our moon, this moon look smaller and at its north end an giant crater could be seen. And ridding not too far behind the first moon a smaller moon followed the first. Bright blue light shine off the small moon and a more familiar shine came from the first moon. We were not on earth for sure now. My heart shrank a little with this knowledge. I knew that we were not going home, where every home was we were out here on our own. Unable to get back to sleep, I went to relieve Sergeant Samuel. When I got there another man was waiting there. Sergeant Samuel nowhere in site. The man gave me salute. ‚ÄúPrivate First Class Francis O‚ÄôMalley, USMC. I relived the Staff Sergeant an hour ago, Sir.‚Äù I nodded back at him. I had seen the Marine at the Renaissance Festival the week before, several times in fact. He had been with several other guys at the time too. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt get back to sleep, Sir?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúNo, not after hearing those wolves, and seeing the Two moons,‚Äù I explained. O‚ÄôMalley nodded, and pointed to the horizon. ‚ÄúWell not just two moons,‚Äù he said as I followed his pointed finger. There on the horizon a curve of another moon was just peeking. ‚ÄúIt's been coming up since I‚Äôve on watch.‚Äù I marveled at that fact. The moon was just barely visible a slight sliver on the horizon. ‚ÄúThat's one slow moon,‚Äù I commented. I was slightly startled when Sergeant Samuel‚Äôs voice came from behind us. ‚ÄúIt was trying to get up an hour before O‚ÄôMalley relieved me. It feels like the first two blasted past it.‚Äù Private O‚ÄôMalley came to attention. Samuels waved him off. ‚ÄúAre there any other military folks?‚Äù I question. ‚ÄúNo one who was currently serving,‚Äù was the reply from Samuels. ‚ÄúWhat about the guys I saw you were with during the Renaissance Festival, O‚ÄôMalley?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey left two days ago. Once my little brother had been ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù from the jousting tournament, he and the guys left to go to the beach. I was going back home after the Festival. I‚Äôve got in enough trouble on the beach in the past, so I didn‚Äôt want to go.‚Äù He reminisced. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some people who retired from all branches here. Just not a whole lot. Doc Bitterbeer said he was in the Brazilian medical corp for a couple of years, but got booted out. And I‚Äôve talked to a former British Royal Engineer, Margret was in it from 18 till she was 25. She the closest to an officer we have. But she‚Äôs too gunshy from her experience in Afghanistan, so she‚Äôll be little help if it ever comes to a fight. All the rest are willing and ready to help. I‚Äôve talked to them throughout the day.‚Äù I digested this information, and watch the third moon try rise. Finally I felt tired enough to fall back to sleep. I went back to where my campfire was, and laid down near to it.	stories

idea for new druid subclass	so I had idea for a new druid subclass: circle of the swarm. it's a bug themed subclass where you pick a type of swarm from the list and gain specific perks. honeybee: create and enchant honey to give buffs and heal your party. mosquito: poison and annoy opponents while buffing yourself with their blood spider: build webs to hinder opponent movement and get to climb up walls ant: being able to swarm opponents with different ant types that have different effects dung beetle: create balls of dung that gives disadvantage on opponents this subclass is still being created and I'm looking for help on creating it. edit: I'm thinking of letting the druid turn into a swarm as a wild shape	DnD
I‚Äôm so anxious about getting older that it‚Äôs ruining my time being young. How do I stop?	I‚Äôm 23F, for context. Something changed the day I turned 23, and it was this realisation that I no longer feel obnoxiously, untouchably young. I put an immense amount of pressure on myself to overachieve, as well as an immense amount of pressure on the way I look. Every single day, I sit and stew in my anxiety about getting older, worried that I may never achieve anything truly impressive before 25. I‚Äôve started convincing myself I‚Äôm getting wrinkles, and have begun using a concoction of different anti-ageing serums. I find myself feeling bitter and jealous of anyone younger than me, and playing numbers games over and over in my head trying to convince myself I‚Äôm still young and still have my whole life ahead of me. I turn 24 in a few months and I really, really need to find a way to tackle this anxiety. It‚Äôs consumed me and ruined my year of being 23. I find myself fantasising that I stumble upon my birth certificate and find out that I‚Äôm actually a year YOUNGER than I think I am, ha. The idea soothes me, because I‚Äôd feel like I still get to be in my early twenties for a little longer, still get to be enviably young. It‚Äôs gotten to the point now where it‚Äôs really, really affecting my mental health and quality of life. How can I stop obsessing over this?	Advice

Enerveration and dmg immunities	If a warlock were to cast and succeed on enerveration (deals 4d8 necrotic and they heal half of that) or a similar spell against a creature with immunity to necrotic dmg, would they still be able to heal half the damage or would it nullify that altogether? im assuming they wouldnt be able to but wanted some other thoughts on it. EDIT: and also kinda related, if they had Resistance, would they heal for the same ammount or half of the half damage it took.	DMAcademy

My job has amassed roughly 1 million individual staples - enough to last over 20 years.	I work in a typical office and every few weeks the manager puts in an office supply order. Typical things that run out quick are paperclips, pens, post it notes, tape, printer paper, ink, etc. When he orders stuff online I think hes just got in the habit of ordering a box of staples each time. The thing is, the box comes with 5 cartons of 5,000 staples each, so 25,000 staples. We do not use nearly this many. 5,000 staples would probably last months. But he's been ordering a box each time along with the other supplies out of habit and because they're cheap. I was just looking through a 'junk drawer' we have and there are tons of these boxes of staples. 25,000 to a box, and dozens of boxes, we have I'm sure well over a million staples. We have enough staples to last this company for, not kidding, the next 25 years.	CasualConversation

Opinion - All of the Insidious movies are good	Not saying this is unpopular, just my opinion after watching The Last Key today. Some of the movies are better than others, and there are definitely things I think each one could have done better, but none of them fall completely flat or aren't worth seeing if you enjoy any of them. Have to say I was pretty impressed that we got 3 sequels that were just as worthwile. If you like any of them, or are a fan of this brand of 2010s horror, there's four movies worth adding to your list.	horror

I think BF6 will return faith to the community.	One of my biggest frustrations with Dice is when the team split for Battlefront 1. I knew resources diverted would impact the Battlefield series and 5 is proof of that, hell even the launch of Battlefront 2 shows a lot. I feel like with the whole team back together creativity will spark within them. Hopefully the upper management changes because of this too, because we know they have been a huge factor in the downfall of V. I think everyone should be cautious and have a wait and see approach to the next game but I am optimistic about 6.	BattlefieldV

Terrible ping and jitter from ISP, except for in the middle of the night	"Hi [r/HomeNetworking](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/), I have been having such terrible latency and jitter on my home network, especially compared to friends who live in the same town as me. My neighbor down the street from me also has this exact same problem. I was hoping you guys can help me understand the problem and make suggestions on how I can get this resolved. I am on the Rogers ""Ignite Internet Gigabit"" plan, offering 1Gbps down and 30Mbps up. **My Problem** The ping and jitter of the network provided by my ISP (Rogers) to my home is typically brutal, except during the middle of the night, say between 2am-7am, where my ping and jitter goes back to ideal levels. Here are some PingPlotter graphs to show what I'm talking about: [https://imgur.com/a/Yse9sjx](https://imgur.com/a/Yse9sjx) Throughout many months and probably a dozen calls to my ISP, they continuously disregarded this issue as something to do with my local setup, but I am quite positive that everything on my setup is working as intended. I have replaced coaxial cables and ethernet cables, and I have also had my CODA-4582 modem replaced. I have even purchased an expensive Asus router, flashed asuswrt-merlin firmware with FreshJR QoS, and put the modem in bridge mode, but this still did not help. It should be noted this issue persists even when plugged directly into the CODA-4582 modem that they supplied me with. About a month ago, I called them again and they FINALLY acknowledged something was wrong with their network, so they created some sort of ticket and said they will have it fixed in approximately 2 days. It's been over a month since they have opened this ticket, and there has still been no resolution, and no updates on their progress towards a resolution. I feel very pessimistic about this situation actually being resolved. My ISP is the only provider of high-speed internet to my home, and it feels like my attempts to get them to fix my internet problems are futile. **So, I have some questions:** * Is it likely that my ISP is taking my complaints seriously? * Are the PingPlotter test results I shared alarming in any way? * Is there a suggested way I can get my ISP to actually work to resolve this issue? * Does anyone have a suggestion as to what the issue on my ISP's network actually is? If there's anything else you would like to suggest or note for me, I would love to hear any and all of your input!"	HomeNetworking
Ever since his death, Kobe has been overrated.	Firstly, I think Kobe is one of the greatest players in basketball history and I don't think he is bad. Now that that is clarified, ever since Kobe's death I have seen more people than ever putting Kobe above Lebron James on GOAT lists for basketball. The popular opinion before his death was 1st Jordan, 2nd Lebron, and 3rd Kobe but now all of a sudden Kobe is almost always 2nd. I have no problem with people thinking Kobe is better than Lebron but I don't think it's fair nor would Kobe want to be considered better than another player, purely because he is dead and the other player is alive.	unpopularopinion

I Calculated How Much Steve Wrote For Each Album	A while back I did the who wrote what series, and using that info, plus adding up all the seconds of all the parts he helped write I gathered these results: Nursery Cryme: 6:12 (15.7%) Foxtrot: 7:16 (14.2%) SEBTP: 11:00 (20.4%) The Lamb: 12:00 (12.7%) there‚Äôs a big margin of error for this one ATOTT: 7:25 (14.5%) WAW: 9:42 (19.1%) Kinda strange he didn‚Äôt think he got enough on WAW, especially since he has the lead credit on three songs, plus the middle of 11th Earl of Mar. Although when you consider that One For The Vine already exceeds the length of everything Steve wrote, it‚Äôs kinda understandable.	Genesis
Starting Again	This time last year I was hovering around the 250 mark, 25 pounds down from my previous weight. While that was nowhere near my ultimate goal weight, I felt really good about myself for losing some of the weight and was experiencing some of the benefits that come with weight loss. I hovered around that weight the rest of the summer, which I was slightly annoyed about but thought at least I was maintaining and not gaining, right? Things took a turn in September when I got my first full-time job in my field after graduating a few months prior, which resulted in moving to a new city and state alone. At the same time I was broken up with out of the blue and didn‚Äôt get any closure about it. That first month was really hard for me in a lot of ways and I ate far more than I should because I knew it would at least make me feel better at the moment. For the first time I was buying all of my own groceries with no one there to have an opinion on what was in my cart and I suddenly had access to all of the restaurant delivery services in my new town, so I went crazy with all of that and created a new, unhealthy norm for myself. I was always aware I was making bad choices but just let myself sink further into it. Now I‚Äôve gained that weight back and a little more. I‚Äôm at my all-time highest weight and I really just can‚Äôt stand it. I don‚Äôt like the way I look, the way I feel, the way my clothes fit. I don‚Äôt want to spend my whole life feeling like this. This past week I did an overhaul on my groceries, deleted my food delivery apps, and logged everything that I ate. I went over my allotted calories a few days but didn‚Äôt binge. I ended up still staying under the calorie threshold for the week so it was a success. I know I‚Äôll mess up but I want to be able to fall back in line when I do. I want to change. I know I‚Äôm capable of it.	loseit
Its funny how people don't do certain things because there's already 1 other person doing it when almost all industries have thousands of competitors.	Like the title says. What should be a reason to justify what you want to do is actually something people use to hold themselves back. If 100 other people can do it, you can too. Originality is a lie, if your idea works, even if someone else did it first, do it.	Entrepreneur

Covid-19 Discussion Thread	Hello everyone, as we have been trying to figure out a way to deal with the large influx of people wanting to discuss Covid-19 on a non Calgary level, on /r/Calgary we have decided to have a daily Covid-19 thread. Please use this thread to discuss anything you want about Covid-19. This thread won't be replacing Covid-19 discussion on a local level, so if you have something Calgary specific about Covid-19 you will still be able to post about it and have a seperate discussion.

I got rolled forward /s	Damn I am furious. I was planning on playing through the HOT today, but when I logged in it was already completed. I am not sure what to do, but I want to wake some people up and schedule a meeting where I request everything that ever existed as basic compensation. I haven't read the forums,discord,prev reddit posts, I came here to vent before anything. I am already playing another game that has a support staff and magician on duty (as of yesterday) 24 hours, 0 minutes, 0,0002077 seconds / 7. Anything below that is unacceptable.

Holy fuck, everything we've done so far has just been a shot in the dark; listening for something to ring when we hit it!	"An educated guess just allows you to know the general direction to aim. Cutting edge science is basically ""well we've done this, so how about this?"" We are tickling the Universe's metaphorical belly and seeing what reactions we get out of it. We are learning more and more everyday about things our ancestors thought to be fantasy. Material has been realized to only be an illusion, and hell, touch/chemical reactions are governed by the repulsive/attractive force of little ""balls"" of electricity and their willingness/resilience to exchange themselves. I mean, shit, those little bastards are one of the main reasons we can even see. They just fuckin release light when calming down after being excited.. The *fuck?* What in the fuck is this *thing* we inhabit, and why is it so absurd!?"	Psychonaut

[Q] How is pricing determined?	I've noticed that the price differences between sites like steam and 3rd party sites aren't always proportional. For example, the karambit tiger tooth FN is $630 on steam and $425 on 3rd party sites, meaning that the 3rd party site is 67% of the price. The talon knife tiger tooth FN is 71% cheaper on 3rd party sites. I have sent trade offers where I am overpaying if you calculate with 3rd party sites, but they think the offer is a lowball bc on steam I am underpaying. What platform should I primarily use when evaluating and sending trade offers?	GlobalOffensiveTrade
CMV: Human‚Äôs worth is evaluated by what he/she can contribute to society/corporations	How can we evaluate a human‚Äôs worth? Growing up in an environment that keeps telling me I have to be useful to be acknowledged. Even though I know that mindset is partly false in moral side, I can‚Äôt get rid of it and I‚Äôm clinging on to it. Currently working in a corporate company that just cares how much money I can make for them. Even people with shittiest personalities are praised and get promotions because they do a good job. Even friendships and relationships are basically exchange-ships. We human beings are selfish creatures in the end.	changemyview

Learning ClojureScript with a Snake game	"Hello everybody! I have some free time for weeks, so I decided to learn Clojure. I went through the entire book Clojure for the Brave and True, taking notes and copying/playing with the code. I enjoyed it, it's a great book, with simple (but deep) explanations. At the same time, I developed a snake game in ClojureScript for people to train to use `hjkl` instead of the arrow key, mostly for Vim. * Here are the sources: https://github.com/Phantas0s/snake.hjkl * Here's the game: https://matthieucneude.com/snake/ I would love to have some feedback. I tried to group mutations at the same place as much as I could, trying to have mostly pure functions. My goal is really to understand the advantage of the ""functional way of thinking"". * Do you see any improvement I could make? * Do I respect the ""good practices"" of Clojure? * I don't really use namespaces. Do you think I could decompose my code with namespaces? Thank you!"	Clojure

My work just got a lot of Matilda Jane in...	So I work at a consignment shop and we get a lot of MLM clothing in (Lularoe, Agnes & Dora, Matilda Jane). Recently, we had this lady who was a trunk keeper for Matilda Jane come and drop off at least two car-fulls of that junk, tags still on it & everything. My boss has mentioned that after we go through it we should live stream all of the pieces we got in. I‚Äôm pretty sure she got this idea from the lady who dropped it all off. On one hand I understand that she would want to do that in order to try to make money & to let people know we have, but on the other hand I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll ask me to do it since I‚Äôm in charge of all our social media pages. Does anyone have any advice on how I should talk to her about this in case she does ask me to do it? We have posted some MJ stuff on our page in the past, but I feel like live streaming all the pieces we have is different.	antiMLM

Back to square 1	I haven't posted in over a week, since my last relapse. It is amazing how all consuming this addiction is, yet so easy to hide it from others. Of course they all sense that there's something off. My work performance slips, I'm less engaged with my family, and less affectionate with my wife. I PMOd just now, at work, after being in the bathroom for over an hour on my go to pic chat site. I am that much further from my goal now of being able to get and maintain an erection with my wife. I avoid being affectionate with her so that she doesn't get in the mood and then finds out I can't perform in bed. It's sad. Nothing to do now but try again. She's leaving Thursday for a long weekend to visit her parents. Pray for me that I can use that time to be strong and rebuild my resolve, willpower, and stamina. Thanks.	NoFap
How do you form Meaningful Connections with Other People?	25F. I'm hoping for some advice. I've never had lasting friendships and only one brief relationship. How do you form connections with people? What do you talk about? Any activities or actions I can take? I desperately need to learn how to let people in and get to know me personally, and I need to learn how to get to know others deeply as well. A little background: I was able to meet people at university and majored in theatre, but my friendships were all shallower than I realised and over the last few years I've lost most of the friends I used to have. My childhood/teen years were full of moving cities and starting from scratch so there's no one from back then who knows me now. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and gender dysphoria and have been transitioning for about a year now. I've always wanted relationships but I have major issues with my body and always feel like I'm years behind my peers in social experiences, career, community, and general life experience, so I've always felt too boring/naive/ugly/useless to actually meet anyone or let them into my life. I'm planning to go back into therapy after lockdown ends but I wanted to reach out now because I'm really struggling. Anyway, any help/advice would be really, really appreciated. I'm not really looking to meet anonymous/people over the internet, sorry if you're a kind soul who would offer to be friends. ‚ô•	relationship_advice
Work Fun	I just had the a great wank in the office toilet. Sifting through reddit and getting so turned on I decided to look for something to use for ass play. Behold the humble dry board marker (fresh from the packet, sanitised and cleaned with boiling water). Lubed my ass with spit, sat on the seat 180degrees as u normally would and got some dick content on screen. Managed to manoeuvre my ass over the seat and fuck myself with the pen whilst wanking. Needless to say the combo of my ass being toyed, my dick being stroked and some femboy riding a massive dick I didnt last long before cumming all over the toilet. With the office being so quiet I can be as loud or active as I want. Dicks gone hard again writing this, so......	gaysexconfessions
Nearly 5 years since I lost my sister (CW Murder)	On Thursday, it'll be 5 years since I walked in my mums door and heard my sisters life had been taken by a man she tried to help. The whole story is far more messed up than that. We are a pretty normal family, she was a great mum, with a good job, but when you say murder, people make sweeping assumptions and it breaks my heart. She left behind a daughter who was 12 and is 18 later this month, and every time I look at her at this time of year, my heart breaks. I miss my sister every single day, but for some reason this time of year with the anniversary, her birthday and my nieces birthday it sucks so much more for us. I still can't believe I lost my first best friend.	GriefSupport

Where to go after create-react-app?	"I feel like in order to learn more, I should get away from create-react-app for my next project. A quick summary of my next project is that it will be kind of a social thing, with user accounts, posting photos, filling out some parameters, etc. Mostly a learning project, but it's for a niche that might find it useful, so at least a little scalability. I'll probably use Postgres since that's kind of my go-to and I didn't love Mongo, but feel free to talk me out of it. Anyway, for my past projects, I just used create-react-app, deployed to heroku with their postgres module. I'd like to move on from Heroku perhaps, since I've had some issues with downtime and my server needing to be manually restarted every once in a while. Could be my own problem, but either way I'm trying to kind of spread out and understand more, so wanted to switch that up. But the bulk of what I want to accomplish is to kind of be as ""up to date"" in this project as I can, using some of the new stuff, learning about hooks, and mainly not using create-react-app. I want to be more hire-able so I'm trying to get with the times. I'm not an expert by any means (as you can see by me saying I've never used hooks), so I'm just curious what you all would say is the next step. Next.js? Parcel? Manually doing webpack? And any opinions on hosting would be great too. I'm not expecting a million users, and of course I don't want to pay a ton, but something on the professional end would be nice. Thanks."	reactjs
Quit smoking and bought a Venu with the money I've saved - I love it.	First I got the vivoactive 4s. It was great but too small. I sold it to my girlfriend and got vivoactive 4. It was a too big and ugly for my taste and hand size. I returned it and got a Venu on the same trip - and It's perfect. It does everything I expected and more. I use it for tracking my health and mental health, running, playing football and doing other cardio. Sleep algorythm could be better, but I'd say it has been pretty accurate for me. Stress and body battery seem to correlate with how I feel. Also, [it looks great.](https://imgur.com/a/Qxj8hwU) I can wear it as a part of my outfit almost anywhere, which can't be said about the other garmin watches.

Did your mental health get better after coming out?	I know all the coming out basics. Don't do it until you're safe...etc For the past year/year and a half I have been feeling more anxious and more vulnerable to anxiety and stress. I think being closeted in a religious household makes it normal to feel that way. Did you mental health got better after completely coming out or am I just overthinking things?	askgaybros
[Help] Puppy blues.	Hey, all. I guess I‚Äôm in need of some emotional support. Maybe a lot of emotional support. I had an anxiety attack last night, and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm making the right choice. Tomorrow I‚Äôm brining home a dog I‚Äôve agreed to adopt. He‚Äôs a staff favorite at the shelter, and has just somehow managed to be overlooked for about 2 months now, when most of their dogs are moved within 2 weeks. And I‚Äôm already freaking out. When we adopted our last dog back in 2012 or so, I was a mess for the first week or two. I needed my own two week shut down. It was constant feelings of having made a mistake, being unable to handle a dog, guilt and shame because I acted impulsively...and then eventually I got over it. Then I just had a lot of anxiety about his care and safety (I‚Äôm an anxious person). Now? Similar feelings. I have a lot of guilt because my two cats are incredibly timid. They live with dogs now, but anything larger than they are scares them. This dog is about 50 pounds. I‚Äôm going to feel so bad watching them hide for a few days, and I‚Äôm concerned my old lady cat won‚Äôt ever get over it. I‚Äôm also feeling trapped. It won‚Äôt be as easy to just decide to leave the house for the day and just go do whatever I want. Part of me feels like I don‚Äôt even want a dog, but that I‚Äôm just bored and looking for something to keep me busy. I have a dog and 2 cats already, and care for my mom‚Äôs dog on top of that. And I‚Äôm not ready for the battle that‚Äôs going to come from my partner. He‚Äôs lazy, and won‚Äôt even change the cat litter or walk our current dog. The one we decided on is higher energy than our chihuahua, and I don‚Äôt think he understands/realizes that he‚Äôs going to have to at least help with walks that are much more than just a quick loop around the block a couple times a week. And I‚Äôm lazy enough that I don‚Äôt want to be the only one taking care of three dogs. And the barking. Our chihuahua is a big barker. The shelter said this new guy isn‚Äôt too vocal, but that could change. I really don‚Äôt know if I have the patience to add more noise. When our last dog died, we both said we didn‚Äôt want any more dogs. For my fianc√©, his reasoning was because he didn‚Äôt want to deal with death anymore. For me, it was because, as much as I love dogs, I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the inconveniences again. I also still hold a ton of guilt from our dog‚Äôs death. He had cancer, and we didn‚Äôt do absolutely everything we could for him, and we also euthanized before he was ready. Our last few days with him, I couldn‚Äôt even look at him. I‚Äôll never get that back. And, let‚Äôs face it, dogs cost money. This is going to set us back just slightly in terms of saving for the house we want, or the other things we want to buy. Not a ton, but enough. But at the same time I think this could be good for me? My health has suffered since our dog died a year ago, and I‚Äôve gained weight and pretty much stopped moving since our chihuahua requires so little. I do love dogs, and I do see a future with more dogs. And up until I verbally agreed to adopt this dog, I felt I was ready. It was once I hung up from the call that I started to feel anxious and regretful.	dogs

GoT Winners and Losers Pt 5	"You know the drill. I take GoT show characters and sort them neatly into the winner or loser category. Sort of like the Sorting Hat but not having anything to do with entry-level nerd shit for children. Jon Snow: Loser It's simple. Jon Snow is a loser because he died and came back. You're dead. that's it. you made it out. you did it. you're done. jon snow had that opportunity and he wasted it. that's not just my jealousy talking, either. think about it. come back for what? more wars? more incest? more cold weather, shitty food and atrocities? come on, snow. stay down. on the other hand, no offense to jamie lannister, i almost ruled him a winner for not wanting the throne. he knows he'd suck as a ruler. he knows he's weak on immigration. The Hound: Winner Winner winner chicken dinner. you ever heard someone say ""i would kill for a drink?"" that's the hounds life motto. all this man wanted to do was booze. but here comes a position as guard for King Joffrey ""Giga Chad"" Baratheon. fine he does it. here comes a war. so fine he fights in it. everything the world has to throw at him he takes like a man so he can get back to drinking. the hound is also the only one in the show that sorts out the supreme brat Arya Stark. all this uppity girl needed was to be yelled at, threatened, mocked and slapped. sandor teaches arya all the stuff that her parents, brothers, friends and aunt couldn't because, well. you know. he also hates rum, which is powerful and right. ale and wine only for sandor ""the mandor"" clegane. this is Westeros, not the club."	freefolk
How do you explain the brilliance of the N64 and it's games?	Hi all, I was having this discussion with a friend today, about how incredible it is that the N64 had titles like Mario 64 (with extremely fluid movement), Zelda, Super Smash Bros, Goldeneye, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Star Fox, Banjo, Conkers, Yoshi, and Paper Mario. How did this happen? Where did all these original ideas come from? How was there such expertise over a brand new dimension? I get some of these titles had 2d versions, but the leap from 2D to 3D is huge! It feels like unbelievable talent at work here, I'm in awe thinking about all the games that came out on the N64! I can't imagine being in a studio, working on new hardware, new IP, in 3D, and executing it so well. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.	truegaming
Ending of Apokolips War	I really liked this movie I‚Äôm just a little confused on the ending. Couldn‚Äôt have Barry just reset the timeline whenever he felt like it? Why did he have to wait until the end of the movie to do it? I get it was a last resort but I don‚Äôt see why because the world was shit throughout the whole movie, it‚Äôs hard to think that he went back to change reality when the Atlantans and Amazons were at war but didn‚Äôt do the same when Darkseid Knuckle Fucked Earth to shreds and only even thought about it when Constantine told him at the end? Also I guess they all die at the end? Like their timeline just fades and they‚Äôre at peace with it? Or are they going to be reincarnated onto a different life somehow? Movie was really good though.

Was the Ace of Spades made by Tex Mechanica?	The Tex Mechanica foundry has made a few hand cannons, one of which is the [Silvered Maverick Mk. 41](https://destinypedia.com/Silvered_Maverick_Mk._41), a rare D1 hand cannon. I also suspect the legendary [Red Hand IX](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Hand_IX) (D1), the rare [Azimuth DSU](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Azimuth_DSu), and the uncommon [Mos Ultima II](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Mos_Ultima_II) (D2) to also have been made by them. If you've seen these hand cannons, you can't deny that they share -almost- the same frame as the Ace. This led me to believe that Cayde-6 had it custom-made, as it is mentioned in the Ace of Spades [Grimoire card](https://ishtar-collective.net/cards/ace-of-spades?highlight=ace+of+spades). P.S: for further context, here's this [lore entry.](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/ancient-apocalypse-greaves?highlight=tex+mechanica)	DestinyLore
PFE might be about to blow this week	So I have a birdy who was telling me about these reports of Pfizer looking to outsource production of certain drugs in order to transition completely to this vaccine. This birdy told me two other NY facilities are now currently preparing to do so as Pfizer must have received some positive feedback from these trials so far. They expanded even further beyond their original outsourcing to a facility on Long Island. Keep an eye on Pfizer, and it might be worth throwing some money on end of may and end of June calls just in case they get some sort of serious hype behind their vaccine. It‚Äôs up on the news, but that news will be expanded upon here shortly. West pharma, gerresheimer, hospira, pyramid, etc. Bonus play: Agilent calls and sell before earnings.	wallstreetbets

People asking people's buying/selling advice	"Why is there post after post after post regarding ""should I buy now or wait a little to buy the dip""?

No one here is getting any kind of commission or anything off your crypto investment decisions. Not to mention, I feel like it breaks the avoid repetition rule. Same with best places to buy crypto.

The Crimson Leviathan	# TL;DR A new boss, the Crimson Leviathan, its home being at a pillar of Netherrack and Crimson greenery (reddery?), a new ranged weapon the Boomerfang, Imagine your peacefully riding your strider through the lava oceans of the Nether towards an unnatural pillar piecing the surface with Crimson vegetation taking its *roots* there. As you get closer you hear a mighty roar as the elusive Crimson Leviathan bursts out of the surface and coils around the column, you're in for one helluva fight! # What is it? The Crimson Leviathan is a massive worm-like animal, with spikes chaotically piecing from its skin and the occasional Crimson plant. It is a whopping 18 blocks long and 2 blocks wide, earning its title of Leviathan. It is said that after a colossal time hibernating, *someone* woke it up, making it very, very angry. # Where do I find it? As stated before, the strange looking pillar is said to be its 'nest' housing the only other traces of its species, yes this thing is a mother, enjoy the guilt you feel after killing it and discovering its probably unfertile eggs, now knowing that it was only defending its children and would probably stop attacking if you just left. There is only one Leviathan in a world at a time, though the pillars are as common as Strongholds, the only thing they are holding, however, is an empty nests and a few skulls. NOTE: The Crimson Leviathan will respawn at a different pillar once defeated after 2 10 in-game days. # Attacks How will this thing kill you, you ask? In many, many very painful ways. It has a few attacks it can do, it will sink under the lava, swim around for a bit, then violently emerge at the location you were about 3 seconds ago, it can also take a delicious gulp of magma then spit it at you, setting you on fire if it hits you, etc. # The Loot So, you've killed it, either legitimately or using some exploit, it's done. What is your reward? Juicy loot. The Crimson Leviathan drops 1 Boomerfang and 12 Netherite Scrap. Your probably wondering 'What the hell is a Boomerfang?' A new ranged weapon. Upon throwing it, it will leave your inventory and travel in a straight line of a max of 40 blocks, at about a sheep's running speed, then return to you at an equal speed. It will deal 6 hearts of damage, and pierce enemies but only on the return trip. Its one great flaw, however, is it cannot be enchanted, but is unbreakable, due to once being the Leviathan's tooth. I hope you liked my idea!	minecraftsuggestions
Maintaining highly sensitive files in the cloud	"Hello Community. I am new to this ""privacy conscious"" mindset and I need advice. I want to keep copies of highly sensitive files in the cloud and I want to do it as SAFELY as possible. These files are JPEGs, PDFs, Word and Excel that I already have uploaded to services like Dropbox, One Drive, Box and iCloud. Until now, I was under the impression that those cloud providers did encrypt every uploaded file... but like I said, I am new and reading some of the posts in here made me realize my sensitive files may not be safe. I've read about Cryptomator but I am under the impression that this software can only encrypt files BEFORE these are uploaded. So here are my questions: 1) Are there any tools I can use to encrypt the files already uploaded? 2) Which one of the cloud providers I use (Dropbox, One Drive, Box and iCloud) you think is the safest and most trustworthy? 3) Is there any other user-friendly cloud service provider safer than the aforementioned ones? 4) What method would you use to keep your highly sensitive files stored in the cloud? Not sure if this info is relevant but i use a combination of Mac, Windows, Ubuntu and iPhone for hardware. I really appreciate any advice you can give me and thank you for your time. Have a safe day."	privacy
Entitled Mother thinks her kid is entitled to go outside despite COVID-19	Hey everyone, and possibly Redditor ;). Long time dweller, first time poster. For context, EM: Entitled Mother (duh), P1 - Police Officer 1, P2 - Police Officer 2, C - Cadet. As you all know with the current situation with COVID-19, the lockdown in the UK has forced everyone to stay home. While this rule applies to everyone, the EM doesn't think it applies to her. It was a normal day, and I was completing some police cadet work (I'm a senior police cadet) when I receive an email from my trainer. The email read something along the lines of: volunteering to help patrol my area for people breaking the lockdown rules. Of course this would be a never again experience so I accepted! A week later, I had met at my local police station, along with another cadet (of course with PPE, e.g. face masks and social distancing). Eventually we headed out. While there were a few people about, we had told them to disperse back, and sure enough everyone listening and no-one questioned me and headed home immediately. I was having an amazing time, and felt proud of helping the country stay safe from this calamity that fell upon us. I thought the rest of the day will go well. &#x200B; BOY, was I wrong &#x200B; At \[insert park name here\] was an Entitled Mother and her Nice Kid. As usual, we told her to pack up and leave. Nothing wrong about that right? Wrong. The entitled mother *stood up and looked at P1 straight in the face* Here's how the conversation entailed: &#x200B; **Me**: Ma'am please leave this area and head home immediately. **EM**: *stands up and faces P1* **EM**: My kid is dyyyying at home, he needs to be out! **P1**: Ma'am this is not a valid reason to be out, head home or we will be forced to arrest or fine you. **EM**: Yes it is what do you know you're not an NHS worker, you're only a police officer! *At this point the EM is standing horrendously close to the officers at this point* **P2**: Step away from him now. **Me**: Ma'am step away from him, you must observe social distancing don't you understand that? **EM**: You're just kids what do you know you f\*\*\*\* c\*\*\*. **P2**: He is saying to step away from P1, so do so now, and NEVER swear at my cadets. *My fellow cadet gets involved* **C**: Ma'am unless you WANT to be prosecuted, head home now. **P2**: I will be forced to arrest you if you do not move. *All hell breaks loose after the Entitled Mother assaults P2* **EM**: That's what you get for implying i have the coronavirus! *Keep in mind that we did not say that at all* &#x200B; I get annoyed quickly, but then she PUSHES the other cadet and P1 to the point they fall on the floor. This is when my insticts kick in and I pepper spray here and detained her while some people exercising calls the police. While this is happening, I get kicked in the hand and my god, did that hurt. &#x200B; Her NK finally speaks up, around the same time backup arrives. **NK**: MUM WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DO THIS, YOU ALWAYS MAKE A SCENE AND PUSH ANYONE THAT TELLS YOU TO DO SOMETHING *This shocks us all* Upon looking at her history, she had been arrested before for charges of assault. Eventually, she gets taken away in a police van, while the kid's dad was called to pick him up. Meanwhile the kid was apologising profusely for his acts. We tell him it's not your fault. He smiles and leaves. &#x200B; PS: I broke 2 of my fingers while this happened, look below to see proof. &#x200B; I hope this gets on Redditor's video, but thanks for reading! https://preview.redd.it/mrolsc3o55y41.jpg?width=267&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=261b5f3014ade362ac2a92a27e178fe6c8f74ef8	redditoryt
Checking whether the cell above is a ‚Äòhigher‚Äô or ‚Äòlower‚Äô value in a table.	Hello, I am new to excel and am using to record my stats in a video game. I record my stats for each game and the rank I have after the game. For example, say the ranks are bronze, silver and gold, if I go from silver to gold it would be a rank up so I would like the cell to turn green, and if i deranked (i.e. silver to bronze) it should turn red. I have absolutely no idea how to do this. Thank you for the help :) Edit: There are 22 different ranks in the game, I realise this would be useful information.	excel
I (30f) visited a sleazy sex club on my lunch break last summer and had an incredible time	Last summer, I was a cooped up *housewife (committed relationship but I still work) and I was desperate for good cock. I decided to look up glory holes (sorry lol) but it felt dangerous. I saw a couple in reviews for sex shops and visited them but the vibe wasn‚Äôt right. I saw someone mention having a good time at a sex club on the west side of town. I researched it for weeks and everything seemed legit, but they were only open at night. I wanted to do everything in my power to stay safe and going at night wasn‚Äôt happening. I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck one day when I saw their daily special on the upcoming Friday was a Nooner session from 12pm - 5pm! I bought slutty panties and pasties to really get my stripper out. I made up my mind to go and told my boss I had a doctors appointment that Friday that might run long. As I drove over, my heart was pounding. I felt curious about what it would look like and about the bad reviews online, but I knew that only angry people leave reviews typically. I called ahead and asked if it was busy, and she said there were a few couples and single men still there and that it was winding down from earlier. When I saw the building and the small sign on the door, I was nervous and excited. I pulled up and parked with my heart beating through my chest, looking at the ten or so cars. While gathering courage, a guy pulled up next to me and hit his car door on my car lightly when he got out - we smiled and it was kind, and I didn‚Äôt feel judged or creeped out for being there like I thought I would. I rolled down my window to tell him it‚Äôs okay; he was a younger and slender guy with very pretty eyes and a smile. He asked me if I was going inside, and I hesitated. I had been planning on just driving away, but the friendliness and respect of this patron made me feel much more relaxed. I smiled and told him I‚Äôd be in soon after I relaxed. I wondered if that was true. I decided to just do it. I was nervous and confused at first, but the reception area was kind. They waved me in and I was flocked immediately by several men that I chose someone new from; an older guy with incredible salt and pepper hair. Introductions were made and I met Rene officially, a handsome older man who was well dressed worn a thick European accent. we made small talk about me being a first timer. He asked about my job and perked up when I said I was an engineer. He told me about the feeling he got building planes as an aviation engineer and that a plane he designed was taking off today. He asked if I‚Äôd like company - of course, I told him. We sat at the table and chairs for awhile and he told me about traveling to Boise for business, and I told him about San Francisco. We shared traveling woes and laughed. I asked him about the club and whether he came there often, and we discussed the different rooms and what they‚Äôre generally used for. I asked about the rules and etiquette, and he said anyone could take anything off and show as much as they want, gesturing to the naked man playing pool behind us. I told him it was difficult to hear him and get to know him and asked if there was a couch in another room where we could sit closer. He suggested a private room upstairs and told me that they‚Äôre cleaned vigorously and have fresh sheets down every time. I had seen on the reviews that the rooms were cute, so I told him sure - I‚Äôd love that. We were followed upstairs to the rooms by the attendant and a single man, and we walked by rooms that were being cleaned. He told me the room at the end was great; I followed. The door opened to an incredible room with a red light with mirrored walls and ceiling. The single male that followed us asked if we wanted company, and Rene answered no for us and we laughed, shutting the door slightly. He asked where I‚Äôd like to sit, the chairs or the bed, and I opted for the bed. He was a grey fox and smelled like expensive body wash and beard oil when I sat next to him. He rubbed my back and I put my things on the table while the attendant brought a condom, shutting the door after her. After chatting a bit more, I took my vest off and he smiled and said that I should take my shirt off, too. I smiled and sat back down, and he leaned in to kiss me. He tasted extremely fresh and smelled wonderful, so I had high hopes for his hygiene. I smiled and told him I‚Äôd been waiting to show off my pasties to someone and took off my shirt; with no bra, my huge tits bounced out and revealed my new lightning bolt pasties. He loved them and immediately started playing with my tits; I could see my nipples poking out hard under the pasties. After making out and kissing a bit, he removed his shirt and said he was overdressed. He still had his incredibly nice jeans, belt, and chuck Taylor‚Äôs on - so cute! We made out again and I said I was going to take my shorts off to show him something else, standing up and shimmying out of my vintage high waist shorts. I was wearing black lace panties with blue tie-up sides that were crotchless, but he couldn‚Äôt see that part yet. His eyes ate me up and he laid me back on the bed to admire me in the red light before stripping to his cute European boxer briefs. He fondled me and played with me through my panties when he discovered they were crotchless. He slid his boxers off and tossed them down while pushing me up on the bed gently and spreading my legs, still with my undies on. He spread my legs wide and ate me out gently while I watched my tits and my cute pasties in the mirror ceiling. He was incredibly skillful and had me near orgasm several times, which I kept pulling away from to save it. I told him he felt incredible and he pushed both of my legs up, exposing my pussy more and continued to eat. I asked what I could do to thank him and he gently pushed back on my legs to spread me wider and expose my freshly shaven asshole. He licked a couple of times under my pussy to gauge interest and I moaned to him that he felt amazing. His tongue dove down around my asshole and licked me slowly and deeply, gently tongueing my asshole and loosening me up. He worked his tongue inside my hole and grabbed my thick legs to pull my ass around his tongue, sliding it in to extend as far as it would go while keeping a thumb on my clit. After an incredible amount of time, I started bucking my hips and he returned to my pussy, suckling on my clit and pushing a finger in, then a second one. He fingered me deeply and slow at first, then upped the intensity to a deep vigorous finger fuck that had me squirming. I pulled away and laughed and told him he was amazing at that and that I wanted to repay him. He crawled on the bed next to me and showed me his cock, a good 7 inch thick cock that was neatly groomed and smelled like his body wash and fresh laundry. He pulled off my pasties and nibbled and sucked on my nipples gently, murmuring ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck‚Äù as he complimented my big tits and how perky and young they felt. I licked his tip and tasted him, slowly working him with my mouth until I got down to the base when he moaned loud and sent chills through me. I pushed my tongue down and licked hard for a while, working his shaft with my hand and smiling with his cock in my mouth while he watched my exposed ass and pussy through my panties in the mirror. He pulled out and told me to lick, which I did, smiling and giving him long, loving licks up and down his big cock. He groaned and told me how hot I was and kept muttering ‚Äúfuck‚Äù to himself. He gently held my head still and fucked my mouth slowly, then said he wanted to see and laid down on the bed. He spread his legs and I crawled between them smiling, locking his eyes while I started to suck on his tip. I worked him into my throat and let him rub his cock around deep past my gag reflex as he moaned. I slid him out and licked him again with eye contact and his body stared to shake gently. As I pulled my head up, he looked up at me desperately and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget my balls‚Äù and I smiled and dove back in, licking and sucking his balls while giggling at him. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I almost forgot‚Äù I said while he groaned deeply and put his head back. ‚ÄúThis is good stress relief right?‚Äù I asked him teasingly. He agreed, and I sat up on my knees. ‚ÄúI have 30 minutes before I have to get back to work, but I‚Äôm here and yours for the entire time‚Äù I whispered in his ear, making out with him and rubbing his cock. He pouted and whined and said okay, and asked me then to get on my knees and in the doggy position. He spread my ass cheeks wide and ate my pussy while smacking my big ass and grabbing onto my legs to pull me deeper onto his face and tongue. He slid his fingers into me again and moved his tongue to my exposed ass, tongue fucking me while rubbing my g-spot. I moaned and told him he was incredible as he moved his thumb to my asshole. He pushed his thumb against my hole and then inside of it, gripping me with two fingers in my pussy and his thumb deep in my ass. I couldn‚Äôt believe this is how he wanted to spend his 30 minutes, but I was in bliss. He used his other hand to rub my clit and smiled down at my body as I watched him through my hair, face down on the bed. I let him eat his fill and watched his cock get even bigger and thicker in the mirror as he took the hand on my clit and moved it to work his cock. He pulled up and got into position behind me, smacking my ass hard and asking me if I was ready for the condom. I sat up on my knees and said yes please and smiled at him. He shook his head and smiled in disbelief when I told him he was hot, and asked how old I was. When I told him, his eyebrows shot up and he said he was almost 30 years older than me and that i was younger than his daughter. I laughed and wiggled my ass at him, and he slid my panties off. He grabbed the condom and got it ready to roll on, then motioned with his cock to please suck a little more. I grinned and crawled over to him, sucking him slow and steady while he moaned every time he felt my tongue. I pulled back and he put the condom on. I asked where he wanted me and in what position, and he told me he already found his favorite and asked me to offer up to him in doggy style. I spread my legs and he got behind me, rubbing his cock on me and asking me to spread my legs more (I‚Äôm tall), plunging into me and moaning ‚Äúyes, perfect, right there‚Äù as he started fucking me. He slapped my ass hard and I pulled my hair up and held it as I was facedown, watching us in the mirror as he fucked all his stress from work into me and stretched out my pussy. I grabbed the sheets and pushed back into him, letting him grip my hips and fuck me deep while he moaned and told me how hot and perfect I was. I moaned as he grabbed my leg and pushed a finger inside my ass while fucking me, expanding it to two fingers when my moans quickened. He pulled his fingers out and gripped my hips, fucking me faster and faster until he was pounding my pussy open and gaped. I watched him in the mirror as he started arching his back, feeling his fingers dig into my hips and his grip tighten. I giggled and looked at him in the mirror and shook my ass while he fucked me and said ‚Äúgimme‚Äù to him smiling, and he lost it - he screamed and groaned so hard I knew every other room heard it, pounding into me with his face up toward the red light and his eyes closed. He took a total of 10 pumps to finish cumming, pushing into me deep and laughing and smiling with the release. I told him he felt amazing and he was so hot to watch as he bobbed the cum filled condom into me with his cock, softer but still big enough and thick enough to stay in me. He stayed there massaging my pussy with his worn out cock in me for another minute or so, rubbing my ass and back gently and squeezing my shoulders, murmuring to me how beautiful I was and how good I felt. I could tell he didn‚Äôt want to pull out; I spread my legs and rubbed his cock from the inside with a good kegel massage while he rode his bliss and came down softly. He pulled out and grabbed us two fresh towels, smiling and telling me I was crazy to keep saying how hot he was, and that he was hot thirty years ago. I laughed and told him that I had just gotten good proof that he still had it, and he laughed hard - no, still works, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm aiming for! He was incredibly shy and sweet. I got dressed and he asked me about what college was like and said he hoped I had a good time with him - I hugged him and told him it was incredible. He showed me videos of his plane taking off and the dashboards and systems that he had designed on his phone, and we chatted about Russia because it‚Äôs the only place that doesn‚Äôt have an aerial map released for the terrain software - it was fascinating. We grabbed our stuff and he got out a generous tip for the bartender as she also cleans the rooms. We headed downstairs past the other patrons smiling, and I enjoyed the looks and eyes on my big tits bouncing in my shirt without a bra, nipples hard and poking through the fabric without my pasties. We walked outside and I hugged him and he said he really hopes it was enjoyable and that he‚Äôd love to see me again - I hugged him back closely and told him definitely if I‚Äôm there again. I headed back to my car for a much needed break and a truck pulled up next to me as I was about to back up. It was a cute guy with a construction vest on that was checking me out. I rolled down my window and greeted him, feeling bold from the great time I‚Äôd just had. He smiled and asked, a lot of guys for you? And I said just one. we chatted about how it wasn‚Äôt busy anymore and he begged and joked for me to come inside, but I told him I only had 5 minutes before I leave to work. He told me he only goes to jerk off or get hand jobs and smiled at me, asking if I want him to give me something so I could spend my 5 minutes with him. I teased and said he‚Äôs fast, and he said yes very. I said no, because I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was against the rules, and offered to flash him from my car instead. I pulled out my tits and played with them for him as he unzipped his jeans and showed me his huge cock that was visibly pulsing without him working it. I smiled and played with my tits and put on a show for him through the window as he jerked his cock hard for me, letting me watch but being careful to hide from the people walking around by their cars. I jiggled and bounced them around and said I have to go, and he shook my hand and said his name was Alejandro and begged to know when I‚Äôd be back. I smiled and said it looks like Friday is my day :) I drove away wet and satisfied with how well-received and respected I was, and how incredibly attractive I felt. It felt great and was an amazing confidence boost. I have always wanted to be fucked in a mirrored room and love red light - I had a 10/10 time! Happy to answer any questions, one of the happiest days of my life	SluttyConfessions
Do you think binaural music could be the future?	I've been thinking a lot lately about the potential in binaural music. For example, if Dolby Atmos where to establish itself in the mainstream, how music producers could use this to create more interesting music. Here is an example of someone who produced a song with intention to mix it with Dolby Atmos (altough this is a binaural Re-render of the Atmos mix).	audiophile

VIP 14 or Books of Covenant to rush T5?	I'm a mid-tier spender (growth fund, monthy gem supply, recharge events, and a few daily chests).I just got VIP12 and I have the gems to go just to vip 13 (around 150k gems).I'm only spinning wheels 10 times , as I still don't know for sure my troop orientation and my target commanders, and that's why I wanted to focus on getting as many universal heads as I can.So my objective was always vip 14.But as a ch25, I just realised I will soon be out of buildings to upgrade for a long time if I don't upgrade my castle which is still level 18 ( I am missing around 163k gems worth of books) . the rate I acquire books is very low (I recently started doing forts as much as i can and get around 50 books per day, so I will need more than 320 days to gather all books for free).Plus I want the extra 7% research speed the level 25 academy will give me, as I still have a heap of research to do before T5, and more than a year of universal speedups (not enough for T5 still, but I am acquiring many speedups from alliance gifts every day, because I'm in a spenders' alliance). So I'm in a dilemma: 1. will I use a large amount of gems on books when my building comes to a halt, in order to win valuable research time and get sooner to T5? but on the same time, lose months of vip 14 (and thus a corresponding amount of gold heads), or 2. use it only on vip and just ramp up on forts. as a result, in the long run I would have a few hundreds gold heads more, but I would lose a lot of research time, and my building would be at a halt for months, and T5 would come many months or even more than a year later. My aim is to kick some asses in war, and for this I need both T5 AND expertised top tier legendaries. I know everyone thinks differently, so I'm not asking you what to do.I'm asking what would you do in my position.	RiseofKingdoms
Scotland - We are tenants and our garage roof has developed a heavy leak. Out landlady says that due to personal circumstances at the moment she cannot afford to have the leak repaired. Do we have any rights to ensure that this is repaired?	She has sent out an electrician to disconnect the light which is beside the leak but says that she cannot afford the repair work to see to the roof itself. We store things in the garage and my husband uses the space to store equipment and materials that he uses for his work, so we would lose income if any of it were damaged. Obviously we understand her position, these are tough times for everyone, but we're concerned about it getting worse and causing more substantial damage if it goes untreated. Do we have any rights to ensure that this is repaired? As it's just the garage I wasn't sure if the same rules applied to if it were in the house itself. We're in Scotland, should that make a difference. Can anyone offer any advice?	LegalAdviceUK
For some weapons, pre-Shadowkeep helmets and class items allow you to stack 3 reserve mods	Hello, As I couldn't find any information for this, I wanted to share it. So basically, pre-Shadowkeep helmets and class items with an ammo reserves perk sometimes allow you to stack a third reserve mod, in addition to the two mods on a 2.0 chest piece. This results in a sometime not negligible increase of total damages, and potentially a greater benefit from scavenger perks. Here are the datas I gathered so far : &#x200B; |Weapon|Default total ammos reserve|w/ 1 reserve mod|w/ 2 reserve mods|w/ 3 reserve mods|Total damages increase from 2 to 3 mods| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Sleeper Simulant**|9|10|11|**12**|\+9,1%| |**Sleeper Simulant w/ catalyst**|11|12|13|**14**|\+7,7%| |**Xenophage**|28|32|34|***no benefit***|\-| |**Whisper of the Worm**|18|21|23|**24**|\+4,3%| |**Heir Apparent**|500|520|540|**560**|\+3,7%| |**J√∂tunn**|17|20|22|**25**|\+13,6%| |**The Mountaintop**|19|21|23|**25**|\+8,7%| |**Wendigo**|17|19|21|**23**|\+9,5%| |**Interference VI w/ Field prep**|18|20|22|**24**|\+9,1%| &#x200B; Feel free to share and complete those datas.	destiny2

Succesful Nebido story	Currently in the last few days of my third 1.000mg testosterone undecenoate (Nebido) shot. The protocol that my doctor has prescribed me is a 1.000mg shot every 7 weeks. That is around 142 mg of testosterone every week. Before I have used Androgel with no succes. Just a slight increase in libido but no morning wood. Fatigue was still present. The reason i started TRT in the first place is because of low libido, no morning erections, social anxiety, concentration issues (i was diagnosed with ADHD when i was 8 years old). Currently testing wether i have Klinefelters syndrome or not. Nebido works truly amazing for me. You have to be patient with it because the first shot did little to nothing for me. But right when i took the second shot i experienced the benefits for around 2/3 weeks. Now I am on my third shot and I experienced the benefits for almost fully 6 weeks. I experienced these benefits from TRT: \- I lost some bodyfat, but that is also from being in a caloric deficit. \- All my fatigue problems are gone! I dont need a nap anymore around 4 pm. That changed my lifestyle a lot! \- Everyday morning wood. Every. Day. \- Very high libido. I get horny around 4-5 times a day. \- Harder erections. My girlfriend also told me that my penis appears bigger when erect. \- Some increase in beard growth. The hair on my cheeks is also thicker. I know people have bad experiences with Nebido. That is because the standard protocol of 12 weeks. The optimal protocol for most people is around 6-7-8 weeks, though i dont recommed the 6 weeks protocol. It builds up a lot of testosterone on the long run -> long term problems. Feel free to ask my any questions regarding my TRT experience! I live in The Netherlands by the way so Sustanon, Androgel & Nebido are my only options.	Testosterone

Notable box office bombs barely anyone heard of.	We all know films that are famous because of how little money they made. But there are also notable bombs that are so unknown that barely anyone discusses on this sub. For example, have you ever heard of 2008 animated movie Delgo? With its stellar cast, cliched, unoriginal plot and ugly animation this reminded few months ago by u/Saberspark on YouTube junk monstrosity failed to gross even one million dollar out of budget around forty and broke record for the worst opening ever in 2000+ theatres, only to be beaten four year later by Oogieloves...

Computer Goes to Black Screen When Trying to Install Windows 10 On New SSD	Specs: About a month ago my computer started randomly shutting down. I'd be in the middle of playing a game (didn't matter what games) and then the PC would chug pretty bad for a five or ten seconds before restarting itself. I thought it might be a heat issue but it would usually work just fine after the reboot, and while the problem was progressing (would reboot more than once before stabilizing) I never saw the temperatures go to critical levels, meaning never more than low/mid 80s. Something to note is that we got kittens right before this happened. Twice they shut down my PC while it was running, once by pushing the power button and once by stepping on the power switch on the power strip. I decided a repair or reinstall of Windows 10 might help. In trying to do a repair I would get an error saying that Windows couldn't successfully repair itself. I tried going through Windows Boot Manager and would get an error -- 0xc00000f. I found out that this relates to the Boot Configuration Data store in Windows. Trying the reinstall failed so I couldn't repair the BCD, so I thought maybe my hard drive was screwed. Ah well, I'll buy a new one. Now I've installed the new SSD and when I am trying to boot from the Windows 10 USB key that I purchased when I first put the PC together, the computer just goes to a black screen and my monitor's LED indicator goes out. I can boot into the BIOS just fine, and it recognizes the USB key as a UEFI Windows 10 USB Partition. But then when i choose to boot using the key to the black screen I go. In doing some research people were suggesting that I pare down the issue by removing peripherals. So I took out all my other hard drives, took out my GPU, took out my second stick of RAM, unplugged everything but the mouse and keyboard, but I'm still having this issue. My gut it telling me that it's the motherboard at this point. But before I buy a new mobo and rebuild the PC I wanted to reach out here in case anyone had some additional troubleshooting tips or experience that might be beneficial. Specs: * Windows 10 Home * MSI Z270 SLI * i5 7600k (overclocked to 4.2 ghz when I built it back in 2017 and never had issues) * NVidia 1070 GTX Duke (not overclocked) * 16 GB DDR4 3000mhz RAM * Samsung 860 1TB SSD	techsupport
The stress!	I really don‚Äôt want to discourage anyone reading this. I‚Äôm not a great representative of 3 months sober. Man I think I‚Äôm loosing it. I‚Äôm so unhappy in my relationship. He‚Äôs a perfect husband. He does everything right. I just don‚Äôt think we work anymore. And we are sad all the time. And when I leave work I‚Äôm stressed coming home. Which im not asking for advice on. I know where all that will lead. What is really the worst is coming home and being mad and watching me suck the happiness out of his night. And then having relapse dreams. And all I want is to drink. I don‚Äôt know how to stay sober when I‚Äôm so unhappy in life. I know everyone is going to stay staying sober will help me deal with the problems in front of me. Or wait for the miracle. Or I don‚Äôt know. I love the cliches. They usually help me. But man I‚Äôm just angry. And I don‚Äôt want to speak with my sponsor. I don‚Äôt want to do this. I want to want to do this. I‚Äôm just tired. And I‚Äôm trying to push through. I‚Äôm going to go hiking today. I‚Äôve been keeping distance from family that‚Äôs triggering. But I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep this up. Thanks for listening. I know I need to meditate and read a book and try and live in the moment and AH. I‚Äôve never been a happy go lucky person. Cue in alcoholism lol Ok that‚Äôs all. I appreciate you guys being here.

[TOMT] [Movie] [Early to mid 2000s] A weird movie I watched about a crackhead driving around in a car...	I rented this movie from the video store in the early to mid 2000s with some friends. If I remember correctly, it was a black skinny dude driving around in a car filming himself with a handycam, most of it was him trying to get crack cocaine... it was very odd. I don‚Äôt know if the guy was a crackhead in real life or just playing one. None of my friends remember it... Anyone have any idea what I‚Äôm talking about? Thank you	tipofmytongue

[MITB Spoilers] The difference between the men's and women's entrances in the main event	The men strolled into the gym all talking mad shit to each other while braced for a fight. It felt natural or as natural as a bunch of wrestlers fighting in a corporate building can feel. But the women sashay their way into the lobby, do their signature poses and form a quiet orderly line before Asuka does some wacky antics. It felt weird.	SquaredCircle

Entitled Mother thinks her kid is entitled to go outside despite COVID-19	Hey everyone, and possibly Redditor ;). Long time dweller, first time poster. For context, EM: Entitled Mother (duh), P1 - Police Officer 1, P2 - Police Officer 2, C - Cadet. As you all know with the current situation with COVID-19, the lockdown in the UK has forced everyone to stay home. While this rule applies to everyone, the EM doesn't think it applies to her. It was a normal day, and I was completing some police cadet work (I'm a senior police cadet) when I receive an email from my trainer. The email read something along the lines of: volunteering to help patrol my area for people breaking the lockdown rules. Of course this would be a never again experience so I accepted! A week later, I had met at my local police station, along with another cadet (of course with PPE, e.g. face masks and social distancing). Eventually we headed out. While there were a few people about, we had told them to disperse back, and sure enough everyone listening and no-one questioned me and headed home immediately. I was having an amazing time, and felt proud of helping the country stay safe from this calamity that fell upon us. I thought the rest of the day will go well. &#x200B; BOY, was I wrong &#x200B; At \[insert park name here\] was an Entitled Mother and her Nice Kid. As usual, we told her to pack up and leave. Nothing wrong about that right? Wrong. The entitled mother *stood up and looked at P1 straight in the face* Here's how the conversation entailed: &#x200B; **Me**: Ma'am please leave this area and head home immediately. **EM**: *stands up and faces P1* **EM**: My kid is dyyyying at home, he needs to be out! **P1**: Ma'am this is not a valid reason to be out, head home or we will be forced to arrest or fine you. **EM**: Yes it is what do you know you're not an NHS worker, you're only a police officer! *At this point the EM is standing horrendously close to the officers at this point* **P2**: Step away from him now. **Me**: Ma'am step away from him, you must observe social distancing don't you understand that? **EM**: You're just kids what do you know you f\*\*\*\* c\*\*\*. **P2**: He is saying to step away from P1, so do so now, and NEVER swear at my cadets. *My fellow cadet gets involved* **C**: Ma'am unless you WANT to be prosecuted, head home now. **P2**: I will be forced to arrest you if you do not move. *All hell breaks loose after the Entitled Mother assaults P2* **EM**: That's what you get for implying i have the coronavirus! *Keep in mind that we did not say that at all* &#x200B; I get annoyed quickly, but then she PUSHES the other cadet and P1 to the point they fall on the floor. This is when my insticts kick in and I pepper spray here and detained her while some people exercising calls the police. While this is happening, I get kicked in the hand and my god, did that hurt. &#x200B; Her NK finally speaks up, around the same time backup arrives. **NK**: MUM WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DO THIS, YOU ALWAYS MAKE A SCENE AND PUSH ANYONE THAT TELLS YOU TO DO SOMETHING *This shocks us all* Upon looking at her history, she had been arrested before for charges of assault. Eventually, she gets taken away in a police van, while the kid's dad was called to pick him up. Meanwhile the kid was apologising profusely for his acts. We tell him it's not your fault. He smiles and leaves. &#x200B; PS: I broke 2 of my fingers while this happened, look below to see proof. &#x200B; I hope this gets on Redditor's video, but thanks for reading! https://preview.redd.it/mrolsc3o55y41.jpg?width=267&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=261b5f3014ade362ac2a92a27e178fe6c8f74ef8	redditoryt

Can‚Äôt stop thinking about the past	Some days I just CAN‚ÄôT stop thinking about all of the things I did wrong when I lost all of my friends when I was 17 (senior year of high school). I‚Äôm going into my third year of college now, it‚Äôs ridiculous. I keep thinking about how it was probably all my fault because of my immaturity back then. I think it‚Äôs hard for me to accept the fact that I was in a fragile emotional state and just immature. Basically, one of my friends had a crush on me and I didn‚Äôt like him at the time that he wanted me to like him. When he got over it, he stopped being a friend to me and just started acting cruel. I thought he was just a nice person, but it seemed like he was only when he liked me. When I stood up for myself and told him I was tired of the way he had been treating me, he got angry and cut me off. After that, all of my friends left me my senior year, and the guy told everyone I was obsessed with him. My friends left me for that reason and were tired of it. I tried telling them it‚Äôs not an obsession because it was an actually abusive situation, but maybe I was wrong. They took his side, and I was seen as the girl who was obsessed with him. I was really hurt by his mind games and one day being nice to me, and the next day cutting me off and leaving me hanging. This guy got me kicked out of class groups and humiliated me in minute ways throughout my senior year. I was alone. I was overly emotional. I spent my senior year always crying and going to the school psychologist because I felt like I was crazy. Some of my friends that left me seemed to think I deserved it because I ‚Äúled him on,‚Äù or just said nothing. That‚Äôs what I feel terrible for. I couldn‚Äôt make any move with him because one day he was nice, the next he wasn‚Äôt. Nothing was consistent. But now I think back and I feel so guilty, like all of this was my fault. When this guy was being cruel to me throughout our friendship for the first time, I even went through my other friend‚Äôs phone to look at the conversations with him to see if he even cared about me. Now I realize that was so immature to go through my friend‚Äôs phone conversations with him, but I needed validation at the time that maybe he did care about me. My friends would try to comfort me the first time around of him being cruel, but would never outright defend me. I felt like I had nobody on my side, so at the time even searching for validation through their phone conversations when he was being cruel was oddly the way to do it. I feel so stupid. I can‚Äôt seem to get over my mistakes of the past. Who loses all of their friends like that if there isn‚Äôt something wrong with them? I had people-pleasing behavior, I wanted to keep this guy as my friend instead of being forced to go into a relationship with him, but I guess I couldn‚Äôt just be friends with him. But I tried. I don‚Äôt know. If anyone read through my ramblings, thank you so much. I just beat myself up over losing my friends my senior year of high school sometimes. It makes me feel like an imposter whenever I make new friends, like they don‚Äôt know the real me, the one who lost all of their friends before. It makes me feel like I don‚Äôt deserve friends.	Vent

I touched my toes for the first time in my life.	It‚Äôs a small thing I just wanted to share because I feel like I‚Äôm a little overly excited about this. I‚Äôve teetered between slightly and fairly out of shape my whole life (nothing crazy this isn‚Äôt a complete body transformation post.) BUT I remember in middle school all the ‚Äúcool,‚Äù athletic kids could touch their toes in gym class. I never could. As I found activities and sports I enjoyed such as snowboarding and hiking (turns out team sports suck and I‚Äôd rather be my own competition.) I would be healthy when I was motivated to do these things, but still generally out of shape. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to last long on the slopes and more difficult hikes would take a lot out of me. I found yoga in high school. I liked it because it wasn‚Äôt about bulking up or being a tough body builder, it was about using your body to it‚Äôs fullest potential. However I had a hard time sticking with it. Flash forward a few years, with all this free time I got back into it! Long story short I (M21) can finally touch my toes for the first time in my life without bending my knees!!! TLDR Never been able to touch my toes. Touched my toes without bending my knees today.

I'm done with this game until the next patch	i have had 0 fun playing this horrible game and hope everyone sobers up from the newness soon and notices how horrible this game is absolutely absymal deck variance, abysmal difference between games, pathetic amount of decks that can consistently win, pathetic experience for a card game overall. mark my words until a major patch is released the amount of competitive decks will shrink daily and this sub will go from happy to nothing but rage in a months time without major changes. I hope riot can make this game worth playing but for now there is nothing that makes this game fun aside from the fact its new.	LegendsOfRuneterra

A love letter to the HP 6200 Pro (SFF)	Over the past year I've been experimenting with my home setup, including running a Dell R710. However, my favourite piece of hardware on my network by a wide margin is my HP 6200 Pro (sff). These seem to have been in wide circulation in colleges and universities, and there are a ton of them out there. Mine came with an i3 and 4GB of RAM, and I bumped it fairly cheaply to an i5 and 8GB, and I've been pretty thrilled with the performance considering the price. In Canada we have significantly less choice and we pay significantly more (for example, you frequently see the R710 for sale in the US around $100 USD, the cheapest you can find it here is around $250 CAD, and you still might have to purchase caddies). But the 6200 Pro cost me $75 CAD, it holds 3 drives easily (assuming you're willing to swap out the optical drive) and it's cheap and quiet. If you can live without the redundancy provided by enterprise grade hardware, I'd recommend these boxes wholeheartedly!	homelab

How do I stop being clingy during quarantine	So hopefully I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing this but it has recently dawned upon me how needy and clingy I have become during quarantine. I realised this when my sister pointed out how I was checking my phone like every 5-10 minutes (I was checking for replies back to texts) and it sucks cause I‚Äôm not always like this but now I‚Äôm forced inside and can‚Äôt go out and socialise its kind of driving me nuts how I have no one to talk to I‚Äôve tried learning new skills and done a lot of yard work to keep my mind occupied but it still does not distract me from checking my phone or trying to talk to people . Between having to revise for exams and being locked up in here my neediness starts to show when I‚Äôm texting people back almost instantly when they take hours to get to me (which again isn‚Äôt something I normally do) and it‚Äôs putting people off from talking to me Is there anything else I can do to stop being so needy and stop looking for validation from others when they text me , help	socialskills
Question about Metro Exodus and the Metro series.	I recently downloaded Metro Exodus as its part of the Xbox games pass PC, and before playing I attempted to watch some recaps, but most were around 20 minutes long and weren‚Äôt particularly compelling, so I didn‚Äôt finish any. I got about an hour into Exodus, and while it‚Äôs interesting and fun so far, I am wondering if the game will be significantly better if I take the time to either watch long recaps or if I just replay the first two games? Or maybe someone who has a good understanding of the story could give me a short recap? If possible I would like to just continue Exodus if it‚Äôs still enjoyable with or without understanding the rest of the story completely. Thanks!	gaming

I'm curious to know what the lineup for Primavera Sound Los Angeles would have looked like.	It's the middle of May, and I doubt they will announce a lineup, but if they did, they'd likely have done so around this time, right? The mayor of Los Angeles has been vocal about not having any concerts or festivals for the remainder of the year as well, and anyone thinking rationally will have already come to the conclusion this festival isn't happening. My questions are: * I wonder what the lineup would have looked like? * Will they bother announcing the lineup before cancelling it? * How long will it be until they officially make the announcement that it is cancelled?	primaverasound
How one character contributed to Shaun realizing that Lea makes him more	When Shaun held his monologue in 3.19 ‚ÄúHurt‚Äù of how he loves Lea because she makes him more than a *good doctor*, I wondered for some time how he came to this conclusion. So, I went back to the dialogues of past episodes and found two distinct conversations with a series regular that seem to build to the idea of the loved one making you more (besides the patients of the week, that also had their fair share in this). >2.13 ‚ÄúXin‚Äù: **Your life is better with her. You're a better person with her. Y-You need her. That's what love is.** > >3.17 ‚ÄúFixation‚Äù: **Lea's right. She is needy and selfish. Find someone who loves you the way you are.** ‚Äì People always say that, but shouldn't we be with someone who makes us a better version of ourselves? ‚Äì **Maybe. But trying not to be autistic won't make you better.** Guess which character said this? It was Morgan *twisted biatch* Reznick! Did I miss other relevant lines by other regular characters or has had Morgan more good influence on Shaun than we ever dared to believe‚Ä¶ ? ;)	thegooddoctor

What do you wish you knew when training to become a trader	Hi all, After about a year in back office I got promoted to a front office role at a trading firm, working directly for 2 traders. I'm starting off on developing hedging strategies, managing PnL, and providing market updates, which I think is a solid starting point for the path to becoming a commodity trader. (Would you agree?) I'm wondering what anyone further down the path would recommend I keep in mind as I start out. My line of thinking: * **Learning Process:** I would like a smooth and consistent ride up the learning curve as much as possible, so I am trying to identify key learning objectives: * Knowing how to analyze a market (market mechanisms, trends/events, S&D, pricing) * Managing a book (PnL, hedging) * Structuring deals * Actually executing trades * *What else?* * **Trading:** Once junior trader status, it seems the key concept is to pick a single market to focus on, develop and practice strategies to build confidence, and then evolve into greater complexity. **Background info:** Having just turned 29, seems I am getting into front office on the later side. But I bring something unique to the table because I started my career off as an env. engineer at power plants. So it was quite the process to get to this point. I expected I'd end up working for a project developer but the opportunity at this trading firm was the most promising opportunity during my career change. If the potential opportunity to become a trader is there, why not take it? They're hard to come by. Also, I am bullish long-term environmental trends, such as oil majors going net zero by 2050.

Beleggen voor neefjes / nichtjes	Beste allemaal, Aangezien er zich enorm veel wijsheid op dit forum bevindt, wil ik graag de volgende vraag stellen. Ik ben woonachtig en belastingplichtig in China. Dat zal waarschijnlijk veranderen in de toekomst, maar ik zie mijzelf voorlopig niet terugkeren naar NL. Mijn zus heeft drie kinderen. Ze is sinds kort gescheiden en heeft het financieel niet gemakkelijk. Ik wil graag voor haar kinderen een rekening openen en daar iedere maand geld op storten (ongeveer 180-240 euro). Ik was aan het denken om ieder kind iedere maand een ETF (bijv. VWRL o.i.d.) te kopen en dit uit te keren wanneer de middelste 18 jaar wordt, wat ongeveer in 2027 zal zijn. Iemand enig idee waar ik dit het beste kan doen? Ik zit zelf bij De Giro, maar ik weet niet of er misschien andere en betere alternatieven zijn. Bij voorbaat dank!	DutchFIRE

"is it a bad idea to write barnard's ""pick a woman from history"" supplement about britney spears?"	"well, the title says it all. the prompt is to ""pick a woman from history or fiction that \[i'd\] like to have a one hour conversation with."" i'm most likely EDing barnard as an international applicant with ok/average stats and good ECs. britney has always been a woman i've looked up to, and how she never stopped fighting for herself and her kids as a woman that lived through some serious shit (music industry messing her up, her public meltdown, addiction, her conservatorship, etc.) always inspired me. i think i can write a pretty solid, self-reflective and humorous essay about her and how she inspired me throughout my life without glorifying and fangirling over her. i assume the AOs are tired of reading about marie curie and rosa luxemburg anyway. on the other hand, i'm afraid my choice would be seen as 'too shallow' or not academic enough, especially considering how britney's public image has been suffering for the past few years. overall, i'm just wondering if it's all worth the risk. i'd be glad if you could help me out :)"	ApplyingToCollege

"flight operated by ""X"" airline: which company buy from?"	Hello! I'm looking to buy a ticket from MAD-DFW. It's direct, so that seems to give me some sense of security. I've been able to find the flight through several different airlines (American, Finnair, and Iberia), yet all make a note that they are being operated by American airlines. Prices are similar for all of the flights. So I'm wondering who I should buy from? If it does get cancelled, would it be more safe to have bought the ticket through the American? Also, what does this mean when one company is operating all of the flights? thank you!	Flights

kicking a roommate out	first year of college, i had THE shittiest roommate. i mean, she was a pathological liar, she would never clean, steal from me, leave her used tissues on my desk, and left menstrual blood stains on our walls, and the stories are endless. she eventually moved out of our room and onto the floor below me before christmas break because of my passive-aggressiveness. cut to the end of the school year, my friend who lived across the hall and i were extremely close, and decided we were gonna move off campus into a two bed apartment for the next school year. then three other girls approached us looking for a house to split, and we figured ‚Äòwhy not‚Äô, since it‚Äôd be cheaper than splitting a two bedroom. one of the girls was actually the one who took in my old roommate, and i hardly knew her aside from group interactions. eventually, us five move in together and the girl who took in my old roommate, let‚Äôs call her ‚Äòchelsea‚Äô, was just trash to live with. she would hoard dishes and silverware and would half-ass washing dishes. it wasn‚Äôt so noticeable because there were five of us so we couldn‚Äôt pinpoint who it was. so, one of our roommates leave, and we decide to move into a four bedroom for our third year, so we can have parking and move away from the immediate city. cut to now, three full years living with chelsea. our new place is bright, spacious, and we tend to keep it clean. chelsea is hoarding dishes, not cleaning up after herself, leaving things greasy and nasty, and is just inconsiderate as fuck.. my best friend and i aren‚Äôt ready to graduate so we‚Äôll be staying an extra year, meanwhile we do not know what her plans are, although she said she‚Äôd be moving out in july. we have new tenants coming in that we picked in march. now, chelsea is telling us she wants to stay, that it would be easier for us to live with someone we‚Äôre ‚Äòcomfortable‚Äô with, but she literally sucks and i honestly want to but don‚Äôt have the heart to say ‚ÄúYOU CAN‚ÄôT LIVE WITH US‚Äù any advice? üò≠ *edit: our lease with her ended in april, but she‚Äôs subletting for my best friend who went home for the summer, so she‚Äôs not on the current lease, but i guess she feels entitled since she‚Äôs already been living here and she‚Äôs too lazy to look for a new place but we REALLY don‚Äôt want to live with her again.	badroommates

My mom's boss wants her to work for free	"Hi all! My mom is a dental hygienist working in The Woodlands, Texas. She only works around 32 hours a week (Monday - Thursday), so not a full time position. Her dental office has been closed to due COVID, but they're re-opening this week. Her boss (the dentist) wants all workers to come in for this week (5/11 - 5/15) as ""volunteers"" that will not be paid. This is because they have lost money during COVID and are trying to recuperate losses. All patients seen during this week will still be paying, and the owner will still be collecting money - she just won't be paying any of her workers. The dentist did say this was ""optional"" to participate, but everyone is going in anyways in fear of repercussions of losing their jobs/retaliation. I've been trying to review Department of Labor laws and FLSA, but I'm lost in the legal jargon. Is this a case where this dental office can be reported? This seems to me to be completely illegal and immoral to me. I want to advocate for my mom, and I know she's just afraid of losing her job if she sticks up for herself and her coworkers. Any advice would be helpful!"	legaladvice

[Uni] NTU Financial Aid	Sorry for sounding ignorant but I‚Äôm genuinely confused. So if I did not misunderstand NTU‚Äôs instructions, we are supposed to apply for study loans/bursaries during the course application period, but we only have to submit supporting documents within 2 weeks of acceptance of offer. I do recall applying for it, but I did not receive any emails to indicate that I have successfully applied for it. Sorry for being paranoid, but I‚Äôm quite afraid that there might be some technical issues that resulting in my application not going through, because I kept receiving error messages when I try to navigate through NTU‚Äôs website and application portal so I did refresh my webpages quite a bit. The last thing I want would be to accept NTU‚Äôs offer and then realise that my application for study loans/bursaries was not received. So, is there a way to check if I successfully submitted my application? Or can I still apply after accepting the offer?	SGExams

It was like walking backwards at the start screen and jumping into an awesome level that was always within reach but never obvious.	LSD

Great apps for Mirroring for Android	&#x200B; I just thought of sharing since I found it useful. I am the type of user that explores a lot of things. I download apps more often to see how can I mirror my phone to a much wider screen Well lately I found out some apps that you can consider using to do so. By the way, I watch movies and play games available on mobile devices on my TV and PC. Here is the list. 1. ApowerMirror ApowerMirror is a desktop app that works across all platform devices. This includes PC, TV and of course mobile devices. What's more with the app? It can record the screen activity while you are mirroring, annotate, and even capture your screen. Also, it has the capability to control your mobile device on your PC. The only thing that won't be transferred on your PC is the sound. 2. Screen Mirror The next tool is a free web-based app. You can access this anywhere. You just have to have a browser compatible with it and scan the Qr code. That being said, you need your phone and your PC connected under the same Wi-fi network. 3. Wireless Projection (Built-in) Many Android users probably see the benefit of having a Huawei Device. The wireless projection feature along with the Huawei Share feature allows you to connect your TV and your phone without connecting to a Wi-Fi server. How do I know? I use it my self. Am I bluffing? Of course not! It is one of the great features Huawei has. However, Huawei share is only available on the latest software version.	androidapps

Threatening Jury Votes Strategy	"This is a strategy I've wondered about while rewatching RI and other seasons and I don't know of it's even allowed. After the merge in RI, Ometepe is up 7-5 and vote out one of their own. Now 6-5, Zapatera works like crazy to try and get one of them to open up their eyes and see that they are brainwashed robots. Alas, they don't and the get Pagonged. My idea for a strategy is this: After the first Zapatera member gets picked off and the numbers are 6-4, they see the writing on the wall and are pretty much sitting ducks. They know Rob is completely in control and brainwashed his fellow 5 Ometepe members. What if they go up to Rob and say, ""We know you're in control, if you don't take put a few Ometepe people before you tale all of us out, the 4 of us will vote against you at FTC."" Let's just say it's not a bluff and they will follow through with it. That would force Rob to do something, because if someone is definitely getting 4 votes at FTC, then all they need is 1 more and hes screwed. I've only seem s1-22 and s38-40. Has this strategy ever been used or thought of? Is it allowed? What are your thoughts?"	survivor

Building a PC for streaming console content	Hi recently a friend asked me for some help in regards of streaming. Because of the quarantine he aparently got money to spare an decided to splurge on streaming equipment. He got: a Streamdeck an elgato capture card (which states it needs a NVidia 10xx) usb-mic and -headset the problem now is he only got an old pc from work so no USB 3 which both the streamdeck and the capture card state the need of. Also in the Programm of the capture card states that his Radeon HD6450 is currently used or has an insufficient driver. Now since he is on the roll he decided to buy or assemble a new PC. He alloted around 1000‚Ç¨ for that since he won't need it for anything else except maybe some excel an browsing. Since i am a full on PC-Gamer i have no clue what kinda Hardware he needs to stay in the loop for a bit. My first step would have been the GPU since its the only thing i know at least a minimum and i would have recommended a GTX 16xx since the capture card doesn't specify an AMD alternative. Any help would be much appreciated. Also this is my first post on reddit so be kind guys.	buildapc

Cutom QMK macropad with encoder	Hi everyone, I have used the search function, but I couldn't find a comprehensive guide on the matter. I would like to start dipping my toes in the QMK world by making a custom macropad. The first problem that I encountered is that there is some documentation for setting up qmk for a standard macro pad, but I coulnd't find much about the implementation of a rotary encoder. I mean, I see some people have done something, but I couldn't understand the process. Another thing I cannot wrap my head around is how I start from a custom layout on the qmk configurator. Layout that I have created on the online keyboard layout editor for example. I would like to start from a layout not included in the options because in the future I might use this for a custom keyboard and would like to explore the worst case right now even if not strictly necessary. Also, how should I wire the enconder into the switch matrix?	olkb

The Joysü§òüèΩ and SetbacksüëéüèΩ with Having a Desi Roommate	"Happy Mother's Day, I was recently in the apartment market, looking to share an apartment with a responsible person. I met a really cool white guy, and we clicked, but he could only give me a commitment in 2 days. Two days later, he told me that out of the blue, his college friend wanted to move in with them, and this potential white roommate guy was going to pass on me becoming his roommate. So I found ""Kumar"" on FB. He was a very socially awkward guy whom I suspected of being on the spectrum. My GF disagrees, but one thing that we both agree on is that he's a wimp who NEVER takes the initiative to do anything positive. This got me thinking to the many times I've had roommates - many of them Desis. Here are some Setbacks that I've noticed; * They never take initiative * They're typically dirtier * When you pay for one roommate, you may often times get 2 more when they bring in a college buddy or co-worker, or parents (happened to me when one loser dude brought his damn parents to stay with us for weeks), or even 10,000 roommates, in the case of bedbugs from Mumbai. * Indians **never** buy furniture, plants, utensils, or other shareable things. Instead, they'll use your things, and degrade it, whether it's your furniture, your TV, your utensils, your baker's mitt, etc. * Indians cook pungent items that require always leaving the windows open. I had this one stupid guy who, while cooking some pungent foods and sauteeing red chili peppers that smelt like tear gas, left the main entrance opened so that the smells could diffuse **into the main hallway for the other neighbors.** * Indians can do very embarrassing things. I had a roommate who never slept in his own room. He was a fresh-off-the-~~bullock cart~~boat guy from Hyderabad who'd sleep on the floor in the living room with a thin sheet over him. He'd sleep sideways, so you could see his profile from afar. Anyways, I was dating this girl, and when we walked in to my apartment, she laughed hysterically at this site. Man, I was so embarrassed. Another roommate from Meerut was peddling some Amway pyramid scheme to my friends. * In college, I had a whole house rented out. I brought in this Marathi guy from Pune. After a few weeks, he brought in this other Marathi guy also from Pune. These guys would talk in Marathi around me, and I felt like they were ganging up on me. The second Marathi guy even asked my ex-girlfriend (who was an ABCD) out the week after we had broken up. She was, of course, playing us against each other. Now, the perks: * **They've given me a chance over and over again to be my roommate. No matter how many complaints that I have, no white dudes want to be my roommate.** * They're career-focused and a good inspiration about pursuing material goals. Thanks Desi guys for being sojourners with me."	ABCDesis

I usually get a iced green tea or chai latte with coconut milk. I'm not sure if this is appropriate but if anyone has an idea or some other drinks they order while pregnant please let me know!

Just hit a yeet	"So there was this one random old woman who came up to me and she was obviously grumpy. She said ""hey what are you listening to. Probably some kind of rap. I want to hear how bad it is. Show the world!"" BTW I only listen to classical music So I was like ""ok"" and I showed her that I was listening to Tchaikovsky Romeo and Juliet overture. She was then like ""gimme that"" so she grabbed my phone out of my hand and started searching for any rap songs. Did she find any? Nope. She then threw the phone on the floor and spat at me and walked away mumbling to herself. &#x200B; I still don't know how to react."	teenagers
I had an idea to solve the repetitive dialogue options when catching bugs/fish/clams	"If you're familiar with playing any game from the Zelda franchise, you probably know that you get a small dialogue from the first time you collect a rupee the first time you load into your save file. So, for the uninitiated, if you load into your file and collect a red rupee, it will say something like ""You collected 20 rupees, don't spend it all in one place!"" Then every time you collect one after that, it's automatically added to your wallet without the dialogue pop-up. I think this could apply pretty well to animal crossing. Say you load into your file and catch a sea bass, you would get the dialogue as usual. Then, every sea bass you catch afterwards would be automatically added after the animation of catching it. This would reset so that every time you open your game, you get a dialogue pop-up on your first catch and not again until the next time you open animal crossing. I feel it would save some time for players who've seen the prompts multiple times."	AnimalCrossing

2020 NFL Draft Review - Analysis and Career Predictions for Each Team's Draft Class - NFC West	We roll on with a division-by-division rundown of the 2020 NFL Draft with arguably the best division in football, the NFC West. Catch up on the other installments of this [2020 NFL Draft review series](https://www.rotoballer.com/tag/2020-nfl-draft-review-series-for-fantasy-football) with the [AFC South](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-afc-south/736898), [NFC South](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-nfc-south/736460), [AFC East](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-afc-east/736202), [NFC East](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-nfc-east/735919), [AFC North](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-afc-north/735564?src=cat_feat_9954), and [NFC North](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-nfc-north/734932). Every year after the draft, I write a [way-too-long review of each team‚Äôs draft](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/blb7sw/gpngcs_2019_nfl_draft_review_analysis_and_career/). The purpose of this draft review is to give predictions for the careers of each team‚Äôs drafted players. I‚Äôve watched film of each player I‚Äôm commenting on. Draft grades are overly optimistic and unrealistic. Unlike the majority of post-draft coverage out there, I will pick busts. Keep in mind that [23.4% of all first-round picks bust](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4grt3c/did_the_rams_and_eagles_give_up_too_much_to_move/). Let me preface this by saying: predicting the career of an NFL draft pick is a ridiculous exercise. There is so much unknown that goes into whether a player succeeds or fails at the next level. I can make educated guesses based on team situation, supporting cast, and research about the prospect‚Äôs character and work ethic, but there‚Äôs a reason teams make so many mistakes every year. You simply don‚Äôt know for sure how a player will react to being a pro. Injuries are also a huge factor in the fate of a player and impossible to predict accurately. Nevertheless, this is a fun exercise and gives us a chance to review how each team approached the draft. ## Overview Before we start, here are some of my general thoughts on the 2020 NFL Draft. Quickly on the broadcast - they did a great job given the circumstances. The production quality was great and they did more actual analysis than usual. My main gripe with draft coverage every year is that they don‚Äôt show incredible highlights (they somehow didn‚Äôt show [the Aaron Dobson catch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCdFFFAxLz0) in 2013). This year, they showed more footage of actual football and I appreciated that. The only two negatives for me were the constant tragic stories and Booger McFarland. Oh, and if any poor soul bet on [Justin Jefferson](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21685/Justin+Jefferson) Under 21.5 draft position, ESPN should apologize to you. They showed him on the phone celebrating right before cutting to Goodell announcing the 21st pick - [Jalen Reagor](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21686/Jalen+Reagor) to the Eagles. Jefferson was of course on the phone with the Vikings, who took him at 22. Brutal beat. As for the draft, remember [this tweet about mock drafts being ‚Äúwronger‚Äù than ever](https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1251100172228218880)? Funny, this was probably the chalkiest first-round ever in the internet age. Nothing was truly shocking to me, including the Packers trading up for [Jordan Love](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21841/Jordan+Love) (more on that [here](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-draft-review-and-team-grades-nfc-north/734932)). I had Damon Arnette in the first round in [my first mock draft this draft season](https://www.rotoballer.com/2020-nfl-mock-draft-1-0/731349?src=). I wrote an [article lauding Jordyn Brooks as an undervalued commodity](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184?src=cat_feat_9954). Noah Ibinoghene going in the first was surprising, I suppose. But there was no Clelin Ferrell at No. 4 or Tyson Alualu at No. 10. It speaks to how the media and internet scouts might be catching up to, or God forbid actually influencing the teams. So here is the next installment of my annual draft review. Each player will receive their career prediction in parentheses following their name. For example: [Joe Burrow](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21693/Joe+Burrow) (5). Here's how the picks break down: **5 ‚Äì All-Pro:** Starter who has performed at an elite level at his position. **4 ‚Äì Above-Average:** Starter who has been among the best at his position. **3 ‚Äì Solid:** Starter or valuable back-up with significant positive production. **2 ‚Äì Replacement Level:** Below-average starter or back-up who made minor contributions. **1 ‚Äì Bust:** Player who didn‚Äôt amount to anything positive. Next up, the NFC West. ## Arizona Cardinals The Cardinals dealt their second-round pick for one of the best receivers in football in [DeAndre Hopkins](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/14986/DeAndre+Hopkins). When you add that acquisition into their draft haul, it‚Äôs one of the most impressive in the entire NFL. At No. 8, the Cardinals went best player available with Isaiah Simmons (4) from Clemson. There were some [rumors that Simmons would fall a bit on draft day](https://www.rotoballer.com/player-news/isaiah-simmons-could-fall-in-round-1/733665) due to teams not knowing what to do with him. Simmons is a quality football player, but not knowing what position room to put him in is somewhat of an issue. He‚Äôs not big enough to bang in the box every down and he‚Äôs not as fluid in coverage as the best free safeties. He made a lot of plays blitzing from depth and taking advantage of his absurd size-athleticism mix at the college level. Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables is an extraordinary defensive mind and played him all over the field at every position except defensive tackle. In Arizona I expect Simmons to line up mostly at the second level, doing most of his damage in coverage against tight ends and blitzing. Fitting him in might not be so easy after adding De'Vondre Campbell and Jordan Hicks as off-ball linebackers. I‚Äôll let Vance Joseph figure it out. Simmons can fly and make plays so it will be hard to screw it up. With a need at tackle, the Cardinals chose to take advantage of the depth at the position and wait until the third round to grab Josh Jones (4) of Houston. Jones was the 19th overall player on [my board](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184), so I obviously view this pick as a massive steal. Jones didn‚Äôt square off against many marquee pass-rushers, so his film was hard to evaluate in terms of translating to the next level. He won the vast majority of his matchups, showing sound technique, but few crazy displays of domination. He surely graded out well and moves well enough for me to endorse him as a quality starting left tackle in Arizona. People make a big deal about quarterbacks and wide receivers transitioning from spread offenses, but it‚Äôs also a whole new game for offensive linemen. With Kliff Kingsbury‚Äôs scheme taking a lot from the college game, Jones will be coached similar techniques to what he was taught at Houston. Great pick. A year after making the wise decision to jettison [Josh Rosen](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/19763/Josh+Rosen) and draft [Kyler Murray](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/20889/Kyler+Murray), the Cardinals put together a solid draft. They are talented enough to compete with the heavyweights in the NFC West, but maybe a year away from a playoff appearance. ## Los Angeles Rams The Rams essentially used their first-round pick on Jalen Ramsey, who probably would have gone 3rd overall in this draft class. Dealing a first for a veteran with a huge contract is always risky, especially with a highly (and possibly over) paid quarterback. They came into the draft needing help on defense. I don‚Äôt think they got much. When I originally sat down and watched [Cam Akers](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21688/Cam+Akers), I became disgusted with the Florida State offense. To say it was a mess is an understatement. Akers made mistakes as well, which made me sour on him quite a bit. I originally ranked Akers 9th in my running back rankings and was met with a fury. I had to go back and watch. You were all right. I had fallen in the same trap I warn draftniks about all the time - valuing college performance too much, and traits too little. If Cam Akers (4) has any work ethic at all, he‚Äôs going to have Pro Bowl seasons with Sean McVay. His traits are actually good enough that he can be an All-Pro if things break right. Akers‚Äô fundamentals and technique were subpar at Florida State. My coaching side also didn‚Äôt like his lack of ball security. However, it‚Äôs difficult to blame him with how poorly coached everyone else looked. Athletic and fast with decent hands, Akers has acceleration and creativity traits that translate to the NFL. He can break tackles and hit home runs. He‚Äôll overtake Darrell Henderson right away as the Rams‚Äô 1A back. I am glad I went for a second look. He is going to be a fantasy stud in the Rams zone running scheme. üì∑ [Van Jefferson](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21739/Van+Jefferson) (2) has the pedigree and route-running skills to be a quality NFL receiver. When asked to run routes with real breakpoints, he showed the body control and agility that can work in the NFL. However, the constant issue in his film is the lack of separation down the field. When schemed into shallow crosses and screens, Jefferson was productive, showing good hands. The top-end speed wasn‚Äôt there, and he doesn‚Äôt project as much of a run-after-catch threat. There is little evidence on film that he can get off press, but he has the demeanor that could work. I expect him to become a just-a-guy possession receiver. Terrell Lewis (2) has traits that play in the league, but he is going to need time to develop. The scariest thing about Lewis is his [injury history](https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2020/04/25/nfl-draft-rams-terrell-lewis-injury-analysis/). On the field, he shows dynamic athleticism and ideal twitch. However, he doesn't execute his gap assignments particularly well and will struggle to defend the run in the NFL. As a rotational edge rusher, it could work, but a lot of his sacks came on inside stunts. Lewis is a developmental project who needs to stay healthy and get stronger to make any positive impact. Straight from my Terrell Burgess (3) notes: ‚Äúquick and good.‚Äù Burgess projects as a slot corner or sub-package safety. He has hip fluidity, good feet, and covered tight ends well at Utah. I don‚Äôt expect him to be a plus in run defense. That Utah secondary was crazy. The Rams paid [Jared Goff](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/17922/Jared+Goff) and now have to live with the consequences. The 49ers have the most talent, [Russell Wilson](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/14536/Russell+Wilson) isn‚Äôt going anywhere, and the Cardinals are young with a franchise quarterback. The NFC West is probably the best division in football, and if Jared Goff doesn‚Äôt play better, the former hottest coach in the NFL will be looking at back-to-back seasons with no playoffs. ## San Francisco 49ers The defending NFC Champions traded away DeForest Buckner for the 13th-overall pick, giving them two first-rounders. They ended up trading down just one spot to No. 14 and actually using their original first to move up to No. 25. Overall they made just five picks, but with John Lynch‚Äôs body of work, fans have reason to be excited. Out goes Buckner, and in comes his replacement in Javon Kinlaw (4). Kinlaw was my No. 1 interior defensive lineman and 17th-ranked player on [my board](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184). He‚Äôs big and athletic with an inconsistent get-off. When he times up and correctly leverages his explosion off the ball, he‚Äôs very good. He can penetrate gaps, fight versus doubles, and bench press blockers off him. He showed a powerful bull rush against the Alabama right guard. The most underrated aspect of Kinlaw‚Äôs game is his ability to get his paws on passes. He can also block field goals. The 49ers' defensive line will continue to be a force. Trading up for [Brandon Aiyuk](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21747/Brandon+Aiyuk) (3) was extremely interesting considering the depth of this wide receiver class. [John Lynch admitted they considered](https://www.knbr.com/2020/04/28/john-lynch-says-49ers-had-brandon-aiyuk-ceedee-lamb-almost-dead-even-explains-what-separated-them/) [CeeDee Lamb](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21679/CeeDee+Lamb) at No. 13, but also would have been fine taking Aiyuk there. Get your guy, I guess. I do like Aiyuk, so I won‚Äôt bash the move at all. Aiyuk reminds me of Dez Bryant. He‚Äôs a competitive player with strong hands and good footwork in terms of breakpoints. My final note: he‚Äôs a stud, just needs to clean up some technique. Unfortunately, I do not believe he will unlock his full potential as the third receiving option in a run-heavy attack. He takes a while to get going, is a little clumsy, and showed some very sloppy release work at the line. A related observation: the special teams coordinator at Arizona State was excellent. The 49ers had a ten-point lead in the second half of the Super Bowl and return most of their starters. Yes, they lost Joe Staley, but they gained Trent Williams. Yes, they lost DeForest Buckner, but they gained Javon Kinlaw. John Lynch is doing a fantastic job. ## Seattle Seahawks Seahawks general manager John Schneider had an all-time great [draft class in 2012](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/2012_draft.htm) but hasn‚Äôt hit on a single first-round pick since. He has been below-average at drafting during that time, as Seahawks fans have seen a once-loaded roster deteriorate into essentially a one-man team. Just as bad, Pete Carroll continues to ignore math and put too much emphasis on running the football (ironic). Defensively, his tendency to play three linebackers on the field together too much has also hurt them. So of course with their first-round pick, they took an off-ball linebacker. I wrote [this article](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184) about ‚Äúmy guys‚Äù before the draft. Jordyn Brooks (4) was the first guy I featured. I believe he can be an impact pro, and he actually reminds me of Bobby Wagner a bit. However, it is tough to defend a Super Bowl contender taking an off-ball linebacker, likely pointing to keeping three linebackers on the field for too many snaps yet again. I do believe in the player though. Brooks plays fast, can key and diagnose, and has tremendous power on contact. When he meets a back in the hole, he drives him back. They liked to blitz him at Texas Tech, taking advantage of uncommon movement skills and acceleration. Against Oklahoma, he struggled a bit, primarily used to spy [Jalen Hurts](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21831/Jalen+Hurts). However, the fact his coaching staff gave him that assignment is telling. I predict he‚Äôll be an excellent pro. If they‚Äôre going to play three linebackers, at least one of them will be fast enough to keep up with Kyler Murray. In the second round, the Seahawks traded up for Darrell Taylor (2) of Tennessee. When I began writing the [‚Äúmy guys‚Äù article](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184), Taylor was supposed to be the second player I featured. I watched his film again simply looking for a highlight to make a gif of and became so unimpressed with Taylor that I decided to write about someone else. It was mainly Taylor‚Äôs film against Alabama that turned me off. The flip-flopping puts me in a ridiculous spot. I went back a third time and kind of liked him more again. Taylor can bend and his profile fits the Seahawks LEO position perfectly. He showed inconsistent handwork but generally was powerful on the edge with enough speed to keep tackles honest. He showed an ability to finish plays and force turnovers, something a lot of edge prospects struggle to do. There was an odd delay getting off the ball on almost every snap against BYU, but he showed a quick get-off in other games. Only one thing is for sure - he‚Äôs better than L.J. Collier. In the third, the Seahawks took my [92nd-ranked](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl-draft-2020-undervalued-prospects/733184) player in LSU guard Damien Lewis (2). Lewis will likely fit right in with Seattle‚Äôs underachieving offensive line. He‚Äôs good on double teams and has good enough feet to mirror but that‚Äôs about it. His functional strength and anchor is below average, getting knocked down by a blitzer and walked back by just one of Derrick Brown‚Äôs arms. Anything powerful gets him off-balance. There were better players on the board. üì∑ The Seahawks pride themselves in trading down and making picks against the consensus. It has not worked out at all in recent years. It would be a shame if their mishandling of drafts continues throughout Russell Wilson‚Äôs career. Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for the final division, the AFC West, in the coming days.

I‚Äôm 99% sure I‚Äôm straight- but my friend has a gay crush on me and I don‚Äôt know how to nicely turn her down. And I like someone else	Hey! So for some insight on this, I‚Äôm a girl. I identify as straight, I‚Äôve currently had a crush on a boy for 8 months and it‚Äôs the usual crush stuff- he makes me feel happy, I get butterflies etc. Recently I had been questioning my sexuality, and I think I got romantic attraction mixed up with admiration because my feelings aren‚Äôt the same when it‚Äôs a boy. So the other day, I found out one of my (female) friends has a crush on me. Even though I think I‚Äôm straight, I thought I had a crush on her too but I just couldn‚Äôt see it happening, (me and another female as a couple) and I kind of felt uncomfortable. I have a crush on a boy right now, but I thought I liked my friend at the same time. I‚Äôve realised it‚Äôs probably just admiration for her, I do love her a lot and I‚Äôm really glad we‚Äôre friends- she‚Äôs helped me so much- but I just don‚Äôt think I like her the way she likes me. I did experience similar feelings with her to my Male crush, except that I couldn‚Äôt see us dating/ kissing/ getting married/ etc... you know. It just didn‚Äôt feel right- because I‚Äôm not attracted to girls. I found out she liked me a few days ago, when I opened a Tellonym for my Instagram followers. I got a tell from someone saying they ‚Äúliked me but didn‚Äôt think I was gay‚Äù. I feel bad because when I found out, I was flustered because nobody had ever told me they liked me, especially a girl, and I responded in a way that might make someone think I wasn‚Äôt completely straight. I was really confused. Later, I found out it was her and it was a bit awkward, but then we became normal again. Here‚Äôs another thing: today is her birthday, and yesterday she posted something along the lines of ‚Äú tomorrow is my birthday, I have two wishes, one is the sky is clear and the stars are out and two, to be loved back. By them.‚Äù Reading this made me feel really bad because I only think of her as a friend- and I knew it was about me. She doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôve seen it. I don‚Äôt know what to do- I don‚Äôt want her to keep liking me when I don‚Äôt like her (in that way, again I love her as a friend!) and so that when she does find out I don‚Äôt like her, she can move on and find someone who will make her happy!
