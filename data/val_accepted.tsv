Undiagnosed for five years in Zimbabwe - please help!	Hi everyone. I’m writing to you from Zimbabwe, which if you’ve never heard of it, is a small African country just above South Africa and next to Mozambique. I’m looking for some advice about my mom – she’s had medical issues for the past five years or so and remains undiagnosed, but her symptoms seem to fit Addison’s Disease. This will probably be a pretty long post, but I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through it all, as I’m really desperate at this point. I just want to give you a little bit of background, as there may be severe emotional issues at play as well. My mom is 46, female, white, 5’4”, and about 130lbs. She was adopted at birth by a lovely couple who could not have children, and had a relatively happy childhood, although trauma may have been experienced as she grew up in the Rhodesian War. Her adopted dad passed away when she was 24 of a heart attack, and her adopted mom is still alive, but has Alzheimer’s. She lives in the UK and lost all of her savings when the Zimbabwean dollar crashed in 2008. My mom has told me that she was molested as a young child by another child that her parents has been thinking of adopting, although they never did. She was also raped in 2013 by an ex-boyfriend. She went through a string of bad relationships between 2010 to 2016, jumping from one to another. None were physically abusive, although I think there was some emotional abuse in some of them. She’s a single mother to myself and my younger sister and has no family here for support – financial or emotional. She was diagnosed with depression in 2013, and has suffered with it her whole life. She thinks that it’s related to her adoption. I’m now 23, but I was 17 and in my final year of high school when she first started exhibiting symptoms. My sister was 14. I dropped out of high school to work and support her, and also had to fund her medical costs, so there are some tests that were not run due to costs, although we did manage to do 99%. Cost is still a factor now, due to the hyperinflation currently occurring in Zimbabwe. She also lives in a town about 4 hours away from me. Okay so now the symptoms. In August 2014, whilst working an extremely high pressure and stress job, she exhibited the following: • Extreme anxiety and panic attacks • Insomnia • Alternating diarrhoea and constipation • Low blood pressure She was then diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, IBS, and a mental breakdown. She was prescribed Lithium, Amitriptyline, Bromazepam, and Piroxicam. After about two weeks, the symptoms seemed to subside, and she went back to work and life continued as per normal. Then, in February 2015, the symptoms reappeared, as well as some new ones. She was still working at the same job. Her full list of symptoms then were: • Extreme anxiety and panic attacks • Insomnia • Alternating diarrhoea and constipation • Low blood pressure • Tremor in her arms, most noticeable when trying to perform a task that requires control, such as buttoning a shirt • She walked with a strange gait, slightly bend over and shuffling. • Pigmentation on her face • Fatigue, even after getting a good night’s sleep • Excessive thirst, she would drink about 4 – 5 litres of water per day • A tingling sensation in her shins and calves when they were exposed to warmth – for example if she sat out in the sun, or if she was in a hot bath. She said it felt similar to pins and needles. • Brain fog and short-term memory loss. She wouldn’t remember conversation had the previous day, or if she’d left a pot on the stove. She was frequently confused during conversations. • Inability to regulate body temperature. She would be freezing cold and covered in goosebumps when it was warm, and put her jersey on, then get really hot and take it off again after 5 minutes, then get cold again. • Emotional. She would be crying all the time for no reason. Once after being at the shops, she accidently walked past our car in the parking lot, and then started crying because of it. • Body aches. Her body was aching constantly, mostly a 3 or 4 out of 10, but no pain medicines helped. The doctor ran blood tests for liver function, cholesterol, blood sugars, diabetes, lithium, a full blood count, thyroid function, hormones, vitamins, serums, lithium levels and a morning cortisol test. Her cholesterol was slightly high, urea was borderline low, and her lithium was low. Her cortisol level was 156 nmol/L. She had a raised eosinophil count on the FBC. All other results were normal. My mother was then referred to an endocrinologist who re-ran all the tests and did a physical examination. He found the following: • Pigmentation in her nail fold beds, creases on her palms, the skin of her face and neck, on all the sun exposed regions of her hands, feet, ankles, and arms, and on the surface of the buccal mucosa (the lining of the cheeks and the back of the lips inside the mouth where they touch the teeth) • Proximal muscle weakness in the legs • Postural hypotension, her BP dropping from 140/70 in the lying position to 115/20 in the sitting position • Nerve death in her lower legs, which was causing the tingling and the strange gait. • The repeat tests were normal – no elevated cortisol, blood ACTH level was normal, repeat FBC and thyroid functions, prolactin, liver functions – all normal. He then referred my mom to an endocrinology centre in South Africa, as he was at a loss as how to proceed. We travelled to Johannesburg and saw an endocrinologist there who was also at a loss. She conferred with her colleagues, and they suggested heavy metal poisoning. The blood tests for lead and arsenic disproved her theory, and the metals were 0 or too low to cause any effects. We returned home and then made an appointment with rheumatologist from the UK that was in the country for two months. He initially thought of lupus, but she was tested and did not have lupus. He then diagnosed her with Fibromyalgia. I was unhappy with this diagnosis, as was our GP as she said that my mom didn’t have the markers, so we then made an appointment with another endocrinologist. He had adbsolutely no theories at all and referred her to a psychiatrist. She saw the psychiatrist for two sessions, but she was so expensive that I couldn’t afford any more. Our GP then sent us to a neurologist and my mom had an MRI, which revealed no lesions at all. Amongst all of these tests, she’s also had various scans of her lungs, kidneys, EEGs, etc. Since then, she has been to several homeopaths and alternative medical professionals. One such person used headphones and electric current to find issues in the body. I’m afraid I can’t remember what the technique was, but she found only depression. Another homeopath used a ball that you squeeze, and it diagnoses you, but she also found nothing. She did prescribe my mom CBD oil for the pain, which she still takes, and it helps. But basically, that’s where we’re still at today. Some symptoms may be psychosomatic, but definitely not all of them, so it’s hard to rule out any symptoms as true or untrue. Just to summarise the conditions ruled out: Lupus, lung cancer, thyroid issues, diabetes, med side effects, heavy metal poisoning, kidney issues, brain tumour, fibromyalgia, vision issues, Celiac Disease. To anyone that made it all the way through – really thank you so much! I’m hoping someone can spot something I’ve missed.	undiagnosed
Frustrated and tired	This has been going on for a bit over ten years now and we still can't figure it out. I am a 24 yo female. I am in constant joint pain and can side from joint displacement. Basically my joints can dislocate and pop back into place with the wrong move. It isn't centralized in any address but it is worse in my knees, hips, ankles, and elbows. I am also hypermobile in all joints to the point where it causes extra pain. Some of my muscles are weaker than they should be, especially my hands. I have been tested for various arthritis disorders as well as various inflammation issues. All came up negative. I have been to physical therapy and although it helped somewhat, it didn't fix the issue. I am currently waiting to get an appointment with a genetics specialist to see if it is something there. I plan to ask about Ehlers Daniels Syndrome but is there anything else I should consider?	undiagnosed
Nausea is awful and stupid	It feels like my insides are doing a relay of deciding not to work. Sometimes swallowing doesn't make stuff go down. Sometimes my stomach takes forever to empty. Some times my small Intestine makes my belly feel like it's made of balloon animals. Sometimes my large intestine decides to not move for a week....and then evacuate everything in one day. I am very annoyed. I am so nauseous and my tum feels all burny and adrenaline-y. I don't know if that makes sense, but I just needed to vent. I dont feel well. Hxbdnsjksb. Tums didn't help. Pepto didnt help. Chewing on ginger helped a tiny bit... sigh. I'm trying to wait it out without taking gravol because it makes me sleepy (though it does help a bit) and I have to go to work soon.	undiagnosed
Undiagnosed Severe GI Issues - Going on Two Years Now	Alright. Here it goes. I have been dealing with some severe Gi/Rectal issues that have stumped doctors going on two years now. I have yet to find any sign of treatment that will help fix the problem, or even offer any real relief from the symptoms. While I’ve always had some issues with bowel movements and etc. throughout my life, the severity of the situation started in May of 2017. It may be best to simply bullet point the symptoms and feelings: &#x200B; * All of a sudden, one day I had an extreme and intense pressure in my rectum. * It’s a feeling that feels very localized to my rectum—so nothing with my stomach or anything of the like. * On top of being that pressure and presence, I would always feel like I needed to go to the bathroom (bowel). * I would be able to go multiple times a day, and yet always and consistently get to a point where I felt that I really needed to get something out—and yet I was unable to do anything. * Currently I still go 6-10 times a day (maybe more). Yet I still get to that point multiple times a day where I feel like I really need to go, but can’t. * To further clarify, this feeling/pressure/urge to go is ALWAYS there, and NEVER goes away. Only recently have I found that rare few seconds of respite…only for it to come back not too long after. * The more I go, the more whatever is causing that pressure gets irritated. So it doesn’t help that I go all the time. * The pressure/presence has been painful at times. * Important to note by saying that I go 6-10 times a day (often times more), that calculates how many times I am able to successfully have a bowel movement of some shape or size. That number does not include the times I go to the bathroom without any success. What have I done about this? Tons. The typical ER/Urgent Care/Primary doctor affair that turned up nothing. I had two surgeries (Anal Sphincterotomy twice over the course of eight or so months), along with about a year or so of consulting a surgical doctor that specialized in this area. When that came to a dead end, I was steered towards a Gastro specialist. After even more specialized screenings/tests, even he couldn’t come up with anything. I also saw a Physical Therapy specialist for the anal muscles, yet none of the stretches or things taught to me there aided me. Panic attacks after the useless second surgery led doctors to think it may be linked to anxiety/depression—so i was told to see a psychiatrist. So I’ve been seeing one for just under over a year and a half. Tried countless of medications. While they might have been doing something, recently I have come to possible discover that they may not have had any big affects. That they simply may have been red herrings/placebos for me to mentally latch onto as a potenial way of getting better.	undiagnosed
Crazy and horrible symptoms for years. No diagnosis.	"Hello all, I make this post in search of answers, or anyone out there who may have similar issues to mine. I'm going to try and cut this post as short as possible but at the same time try to give my best description of what is happening. If I went into detail about everything that has happened, this post would be way too long and I'd be typing for hours. I'm a 30yr old male. For the past few years, many strange mostly very painful symptoms have slowly progressively interfered with my life to the point where I can no longer work or function like a normal person. I am in so much pain that I have to constantly take controlled substances just to make it through the day. Before all of this started around 2014, 2015 or so, I never had ANY health problems whatsoever. I was born with an inner ear deformity that caused permanent hearing loss, but that is the only thing. I also have pectus excavatum and mild scoliosis because of it, but according to many doctors, these things are insignificant. The pain that I feel is a massive ""congestion"" type feeling that feels like blood or fluid is backed up in my body. This feeling intensifies greatly after sexual activity or going to the bathroom, or sometimes it intensifies just randomly. Sometimes it goes away, but over the last few months, it has not gone away at all and it is just beyond intense. Doctors won't prescribe me pain medicine because of the country-wide opioid crisis (United States). I think about suicide every day and how I am going to do it. Please keep in mind that these thoughts are not due to depression or hopelessness. It is simply because of the constant physical torture. I am very close to the point where I just simply can't take it anymore. It is way too intense. I have spent the last few years, starting around January 2017, constantly moving from doctor to doctor, hospital to hospital, trying to figure out what the hell is going on. EVERYONE is completely stumped. I am just at a complete loss for words that I can be in this much pain and absolutely NOTHING shows up on any test or imaging done. I have had countless MRIs, CT scans, and blood tests. Anything you can possibly imagine, I've had it done. I've been to the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and John's Hopkins medical centers. All of these places either gave me a false diagnosis or no diagnosis at all, because my symptoms are just so bizarre. My issue does not feel like actual ""chronic pain"". It feels like a blood flow or some type a fluid flow issue. It feels like fluid or blood gets backed up or stuck in random places in my body and causes very intense discomfort. Sometimes going to the bathroom or sexual activity, or some other random bodily function, like sneezing, can cause temporary relief. But the ""congestion"" pain always comes back. I am currently in the application process for the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. However, the acceptance rate is very low and it takes 6-8 weeks just for them to consider you as a patient. Honestly, I don't know if I can even make it that far. I am just so desperate at this point. I just don't know what to do. I am trying my very best to get through each day, and it is getting harder and harder. It is completely destroying me, my family, and everyone who cares for me. This is a cry for help. I really don't know what to do. It is just so intense. There is something seriously wrong with my body and at this point I don't know who can help me. If ANYONE could give me some sort of input or point me in the right direction. I would be so grateful. Thank you."	undiagnosed
Kindly help me	23 yo, male. Marijuana smoker for three years which got excessive in the last one year. Bad routine and not enough diet, plus masturbation once a day. I know, all on me. A month ago felt that I wasn't getting relieved after urinating. No matter how hard I tried, there'd be this feeling that some was left. And so had to go many times. For three four days, I was constantly aware of my urethral region. It was a nightmare. Went to doctor. Had urine culture done, uroflowmetry, ultrasound, sugar, all normal, kidney and bladder function, etc. Just the flow of urine was less. They said it's a psychiatric issue when I told them about marijuana use and prescribed anti anxiety meds. Although haven't taken them. Now it's been a month, I haven't used marijuana and neither will I do that ever. Started a good healthy regimen. Don't know what happened but it went away for 2-3 days, then came back. Now I have to go like 8-9 times a day, it was 3-4 earlier. And sometimes the slightest of urge is there even when I went 10 minutes ago. They've also said it's psychosomatic. But I don't know. If someone could help me?	undiagnosed

Rapid heart rate and back pain, not sure the cause	"My story begins in 2004, though 2004-2009 is possibly unrelated to what I'm having now. But to summarize quickly what happened in 2004, I had a month of: burning stomach, hot flashes and feeling generally miserable. After that month, I then spent 5 years where, basically, at night, when I laid down to sleep, I'd get heart palpitations and have to lean forward or sit up. Essentially I had to basically get back up and do other things for 2-3 hours until finally, somehow, I got to sleep without the palpitations. That'd cycle on for 3-4 weeks then I'd spend a month or two OK, then back to a few weeks of palpitations. I spent 5 years doing EKGs, an echocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound, even brain MRI. Nothing found. The only possible clue was that in 2008 I was furiously Googling to try and figure it all out, and found Lyme, and I remembered that in 2004 I had a red rash on my neck for 2 weeks at the beginning, and I thought it might be Lyme. But at that point, 5 years later, it was too long after to get a positive blood test, so I don't know. My 2004-2009 nightmare ended after I lost weight and started exercising. &#x200B; But then, fast forward to April 2018, now I am 41, I was riding in a car, and suddenly I felt nauseous and like something was very wrong (and in retrospect I had probably had rapid heart rate same as the incidents that came later), it stopped and only happened that one day. I went to the doctor a couple days later, they found nothing, but they didn't check much. I had gained weight again, so I ended up spending a few months losing weight and getting in great cardio shape. In June, I had a couple of weeks where I felt what felt like a rubber band putting a little bit of pressure around my head. Went to doc, found nothing wrong except high triglycerides and high C reactive protein (side note: by October those were both rock bottom low after 4 more months of exercise and avoiding the worst foods). &#x200B; In October I may have had a UTI or prostate infection, it appears to have went away. &#x200B; In December my new nightmare began, I had another incident like the one in April but this time unmistakable and unignorable rapid heart rate and arm shaking. No significant chest pain or shortness of breath. went to ER, they found nothing. Of note, that time it happened while driving. 4 days later, same thing, ER, found nothing. This time it woke me up at 2AM, not while driving. Then in the week after that I had some pale stool and some daytime non-driving occurrences of this, that were partly relieved by passing that pale stool. At that point I was beginning to have some back/side pain, not much but some, in addition to the rapid heart rate incidents. And of note, these were not all-day lasting, but, they also did not seem to be tied to a certain time after eating. During that week, I had a chest CT with iodine contrast, that found nothing but small lung granulomas. at the end of that week an external abdominal ultrasound found a gallstone and supposedly nothing else. Of note, the gallstone was mobile and no evidence of cholecystitis, but the doctor suggested that the gallstone was the problem. or at least at first. Now, this was during Christmas week at that point, and suddenly I began having hot and cold flashes, resting heart rate elevated all day long, severe diarrhea, and more. At first I thought it was anxiety but I quickly found out my T4 levels were high...and to skip ahead a bit, nothing was ever found wrong with my thyroid, it must have been from the iodine contrast. I took thyroid medication for a couple weeks but it ended up coming back down even without. 3 side notes: one, during the first week my thyroid was up (but before I knew that's what it was), I hardly ate for 3-4 days. After I started eating again, I had very slow digestion (I don't think it was constipation, just very slow digestion) and noticeable undigested food in stool. That took 2-3 weeks to recover. Two, I'd also lost about 17 pounds unexpectedly, although I know that weight loss started BEFORE those days I hardly ate. I can only assume that it was the high thyroid levels that caused it, but, I cannot definitely match up the dates because of the delay in finding out my thyroid was high. Of note, the weight loss did stop and hasn't started again. Three, during those weeks my thyroid was high, even after the thyroid medication got my resting heart rate under control, for a couple weeks there I really felt like my heart was weak, even when resting and my resting heart rate was in the normal area I expected. Additionally, just standing up, not even walking, would take my heart rate straight to 125 or so. Those have mostly recovered... &#x200B; Moving on, during the 3-4 weeks that my thyroid levels were up, yes, my resting heart rate was up, but interestingly, I did not have any of the extreme rapid heart rate incidents. But, a couple of weeks after my thyroid levels came back down, starting end of Jan/early Feb, I began having the specific rapid heart incidents again AND the back pain came back and this time some pretty regular pale stools. At first, the rapid heart rate incidents occurred almost exclusively driving or riding in a car, but over time they now happen at home or work sometimes too. &#x200B; So, I went back to doctors, at first to investigate the back pain, and another ultrasound was done. This time splenic hemangioma was found (and it was found on the December US in retrospect), but is assumed to be a non-significant finding. The gallbladder was also found unchanged...no evidence of cholecystitis, despite the gallstone. Apparently stable. A gastroenterologist reviewed it all and said yea, none of this looks like biliary colic. Seemingly ruling out the gallbladder...? &#x200B; Now, at this point, 3 weeks ago, the rapid heart rate incidents are starting to happen daily, so I go back to the doctor to move forward on that too. And long story short, they want me to try Buspirone, in other words, to see if anxiety's the cause. basically blaming it on anxiety, and I know that's not it, but, I've been taking it, because if I don't they'll say I didn't even try it, and if I'd argued about it up front, that might have been taken as proof that anxiety is correct. In any case, after 3 weeks of taking it, zero effect. Does nothing to prevent or lessen the incidents, and does not change my state of mind in any way because, there's no primary anxiety to treat. And at this point the rapid heart rate incidents have gotten frequent enough that I've gone to the ER again twice. Unfortunately they're mostly only doing cardiac workups, and finding nothing, and I'm convinced there is no cardiac cause anyway. Of course, I always mention the back pain and pale stool but that doesn't elicit much interest at the ER. Anyway, the ER, too, is claiming it's anxiety. Now, I understand Buspirone takes a few weeks to build up, and it has been 3 weeks anyway, but the ER gave me a 1mg lorazepam, which did absolutely nothing, not even drowsiness, and I still got a minor rapid heart rate incident on the way home. They also gave me a prescription for something faster acting than Buspirone, which is hydroxyzine. So, the next day before I was due to get my ride home (I can't drive anymore due to the risk of these incidents), I took the hydroxyzine about 2PM. It made me so sleepy that I had to nap for 2 hours at work, and on the way home I was drowsy with head lolling. And guess what? Rapid heart rate still occurred through the drowsiness! I don't know the reason this is happening a lot more often while in a car than at home or work, but the anxiety medications are not doing anything at all, except the side effect of drowsiness. Anxiety makes zero sense as a cause anyway; the symptoms came first, and it was as bad on the very first day it happened in Dec, back at a time when I didn't know anything was going to happen and thus had no anxiety about it. And no, there's nothing stressing me about work, or at home, and I don't have fear of riding or driving in cars, nothing. And then there's the back pain... for that,.they wanted me to try taking ibuprofen. Tried, did nothing. That pain too is getting worse, and more pale stool, and I'm beginning to get vague but extant aches in my front chest and epigastric area. Very vague, but still there, and starting to worry me as it has been going on over 6 weeks. It is unfortunate though that I have focused more of my appeals to the doctor on the heart rate rather than the back pain and pale stools....because the heart rate is easier to pin on something dismissive like anxiety than the pale stools are. In retrospect I'd have focused more on that... Here's a summary of tests I've done: Various EKGs all throughout last 3 months: nothing Various bloodwork- nothing (except thyroid as explained), multiple CMP, CBCs, insulin, etc. WBC were mildly elevated a couple times, that's it ER on 12/8, 12/12 and 12/19, standard cardiac workup and chest xray, nothing Dec14 : Chest CT, nothing but granulomas Dec 21: Abdominal US, gallstone but no cholecystitis, common bile duct non dialted and retrospectively, splenic lesion 1cm suggestive of hemangioma. ""Visualized portions of pancreas unremarkable, tail obscured"", everything else unremarkable Dec 27: T4 as high as 2.5ish, took methimazole for a couple weeks In the middle of my high thyroid days, I did go to the ER a couple of other times between Dec 23 and 27 thinking the gallbladder was infected...it wasn't. I probably would not have even gone those extra times if my thyroid hadn't been high, but it was. Jan 14: iodine uptake scan, 100% normal. At that point the doc decided the iodine from the CT must have caused the high thyroid Jan 29: Scrotal ultrasound normal, so no chance of a testicular tumor that could have affected thyroid Feb 15: Second abdominal US, gallstone still mobile, no evidence of cholecystitis, ""head of pancreas unremarkable, body and tail obscured by bowel gas artifact"", 1cm splenic hemangioma seen (and also seen in retrospective review of Dec 21 US), all else unremarkable Feb 28: Xray to look at chest/back, nothing found 3/5 and 3/12 ER, cardiac workup (except no xrays this time) shows nothing, and they also did CMP, nothing (although this time they did not provide me with the actual lab results so I don't know that for 100% sure) 3/7 Went to a dentist for xrays for good measure, need some work on 5-6 teeth but nothing seems infected 3/18: Did a treadmill stress test. 10.10 METS, comments on report basically said nothing wrong. This was ordered 6 weeks ago back when I was starting to have the rapid heart rate incidents again, but before I realized the back pain/pale stool was coming back, so at that point I saw a cardiologist thinking the rapid heart rate was all I needed to investigate, and he ordered the stress test. Heart problems seemed to be ruled out. Gallbladder was seemingly ruled out, but is it really? Given the location of the back pain (it matches the referred pain maps for gallbladder and liver referred pain), and the pale stool, I mean, it still could be the gallbladder, either that or the liver or pancreas. Although both ultrasounds found liver and pancreas unremarkable/normal echogenicity, and amylase/lipase/insulin and liver panels have always been right in normal range. I do think the heart rate and the back pain/pale stools are related though. The only good news is that the doctor has been willing to order a HIDA scan which should definitively determine if the gallbladder is the problem, but it won't look at anything besides the liver and gallbladder, and if it comes back negative, to me, the next step would be an abdominal CT to get a better look at pancreas than the ultrasounds did, but I don't know how I'm going to power through the doctor's desire to blame it all on anxiety/musculoskeletal back pain. I thought I had more time to humor them on the anxiety and costochondritis comedy routine, but the rapid heart rate is almost happening every day now and the back pain getting worse, and also the vague pains elsewhere are starting, so I can't just let it go. Any ideas? &#x200B;"	undiagnosed
I just want an answer	For over 5 years, I’ve had issues with my left foot. It has been swollen permanently for 5 years, and I’ve had pain in my left ankle, and issues walking for long periods for just as long. I never had any major issues, just wore a compression sock if it got bad. But 2 years ago, things changed. I started getting blisters on my second toe, and I would stick a bandaid on it and not worry. I woke up on a Friday, and could not bear weight on it without serious pain. I had an infection. My parents took me to the ER, and I was there for 36 hours, and watched as this ominous red line spread through my toe and up my foot. Luckily, the infection started receding before it got to my ankle. I was on bed rest for 2 weeks. I had blood tests, 2 ultra-sounds (from my hip to my toe), and an X-ray, and everything came back completely normal. Since then, I have had trouble getting moving in the morning, or after I’ve been sitting for a couple of hours. I can’t stay on my feet for long (which makes shopping hard haha) and my left knee is also starting to play up. I’ve never had issues in my right leg, and no problems with fluid retention, blisters or anything else like this anywhere else in my body, My GP is great, but we have no idea where to go next, so we’re just treating each symptom as it comes. All I want is a diagnosis. I’ve accepted that it’ll never get better, I just want to stop it getting worst, and have an answer.	undiagnosed
What do I do next?	"Hello all, My doctor and I have been working to try and sort out what is going on with mw for a few months now. I am super lucky to have an attentive and open doctor so he has been avtually listening to my symptoms and running all kinds of tests. However first set is all back (normal fml) and I have a follow up in 2 weeks to make a ""battle plan"" so I'm hoping to get some ideas from here to run past him. Symptoms: *Headaches: I used to get migraines a few times a month with weather changes, hormonal changes, or gehydration. I now have headaches (sometimes mild, sometimes full migraine with sensitivity and vomiting) every single day. Changed pretty suddenly in the last 8 months. *Unexplained nausea/vomiting: I keep waking up between 3-5 am, seemingly for no reason. I will wake up about every 10 minutes for a while, then have a sudden rush of nausea, sometimes but not always followed by vomiting. Usually feel better after. Sometimes repeats an hour or so later. I also get rushes of nausea throughout my day that gobaway within a few minutes. *Chest tightness/fluttery heart feeling: Just that. Sporadically in my day, goes away in a few monutes usually. The chest tightness has been getting worse this week. Finally, just a few weeks ago I got a tiny scrape on my knuckle that somehow resulted in me full on passing out? I have never fainted before, and am very unbothered by blood or injuries. It took a full 5 or so minutes to actually lose consciousness, when I did I was only out for a minute or so? Woke up breifly to tell my Fiance I was peeing (so embarassing) and he called the ambulance. (They cleared me on arrival and we agreed not to go to the hospital as all their stuff came up fine.) Most concerning part here is the loss of bladder control... I have an MRI coming in April, and a 24 hour holter monitor going on today. We have checked my thyroid, my glucocse, my blood pressure, a bunch of other bloodwork (cant find the paper urgh) and did an EEG which came back normal. I have other really odd symptoms but at this point I have no clue what is related and what isn't and I have 0 trust for my body right now, so just ask!"	undiagnosed
Suffering for 2+ years - help wanted	Hi, I guess I'm writing this from a place of desperation, as my partner has been suffering with an undiagnosed condition for over 2 years now, and he's really gotten to a point of giving up hope. It's hard for me to explain his symptoms, because they're a bit all over the place, but I'll give it a go. It all started when he took 2 very long flights and when he got off the plane he had headaches and motion sickness for about 3 months. Eventually the motion sickness subsided, however occasionally he still feels as though the world is rocking or swaying. (He has been checked for vertigo and tinnitus etc. at a Ear, Nose and Throat specialist and all they found were pullups in his nose which can cause mild discomfort of the sinus region). These headaches have persisted every single day since then. They are annoying, but he has kind of learnt to deal with these daily headaches most of the time. It is not these headaches that are his main concern (although they do affect his mood and ability to work). He has these episodes where he gets really weird symptoms. Sometimes it is light sensitivity, or numbness or the arm or part of the face, he can get flashes of pain in his chest or parts of the head, he gets strange feelings in his head (I can't really explain since I don't personally get them). He has had an MRI and it came back clear except for some evidence of possible migraines. So he was diagnosed with having migraines, but the issue is none of the migraine medications help. He takes nortriptyline daily and has tried heaps of other meds e.g. topomax, sumatriptan etc but none help. He's tried chiropractors, osteopaths, physiotherapists etc. Etc. We've seen multiple specialists and they all just say its migraines, but it doesn't seem to fit very well. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Or does anyone else have any idea what could be wrong or what other treatments we can try? Thanks!!!	undiagnosed
I’ve had a hell of a morning.	I’m a college student and I just spent $2,000 fucking dollars on an endoscopy to see why I’m having constant stomach pains, nausea, and diarrhea. Want to guess the result? Absolutely nothing wrong! No ulcers, no inflammation, not even old healed ulcers. I am 100% fucking HEALTHY. And now, because of that, I’m going to be going to school full time and working at least 20 hours a week. I study engineering, and while some people are good at it, I am not. I have family I like to visit on weekends. That’s not happening. I’m a leader of a club. That’s gotta go away. I’m also married, and that’s not a problem, but my husband has his own undiagnosed issues that look a lot like MS- extreme fatigue and his legs buckle and fail a lot. So I try to help out with him. So basically what I’m saying is a lot of time just went down the drain so I could get this ABSOLUTELY USELESS procedure. I fucking hate my body for this. Anytime something’s wrong, it’s diagnosed healthy and I just deal with it. Fucking great.	undiagnosed

Need an answer because I can't take it anymore	I've read that Reddit has helped solve some mysteries. It's been a few years now I started to get this cold feeling in the upper part of my arm when the temperature drops or when I'm an an air conditioned place. It started as a small area in my arm and ever since then it's spread to both my arms, neck, chest and now my face. I have seen about 3 or 4 neurologist's and had tried different medications and nothing seems to help. Two of them have sent me to get an MRI to see if what could be causing this. All of the doctors I've seen either tell me that i should have gotten this when I was little due my my car accident, fibromyalgia or they simply don't know what's wrong with me. I'm up to the point where I can't take it anymore and I just want to know what's going on with me. If anyone knows or could know what is wrong I would greatly appreciate it!	undiagnosed
Neurological issues following getting Flu like symptoms last month	M 22, 5’11” 221 ilbs Non smoker Caucasian Non drug use No alcohol use. June 28th- Current date Hey everyone. Thanks for taking the time to read this. (Positive for band 41 on Western Blot) I have been going through the worst month and a half of my life and it’s putting me in a very bad spot mentally. In the middle of June I found some small black thing 2x the size of a poppy seed maybe. It was 1am, was in bed. And I found it directly underneath my groin. I had to remove it with tweezers. Couldn’t tell what it was but I assume it could’ve been a tick, it also wasn’t moving when I removed it? So skip to a week and a half later. I end up getting really bad flu like symptoms. ( Night Sweats, Fever, Swollen Lymph Nodes, Chills, Weakness, Sore Throat) Urgent care just gave me Amoxicillin and said it was more than likely an upper respiratory. 2 days in on that I had horrible sores throughout my mouth and Thrush (Candida) Few days after that I started getting really bad neurological issues. - Memory Loss - Vertigo - No Depth Perception - Confusion - Cognitive Decline - Feeling like the left side of my head is empty - Bipolar cycling - Some hearing sensitivity - Left ear feels like fuzz always I felt like I was living in a bad fever dream What’s worse is I’m self aware of how horrible this all is. It’s like the entire left side of my head has been filled with molasses. I can’t think straight or logically. I can’t be creative. I don’t feel like myself. I started getting kidney pains and have begun the need to constantly have to urinate. Even my most recent blood work came back saying my kidney function was slightly below my normal amount. And my New Born White Blood Cell Count has been slightly elevated as well. I’ve seen a few different doctors and they all just say because my blood work has come back pretty clean that there’s nothing wrong with me and sent me home. I’ve been to the hospital 2 times. I’m absolutely mortified. The only remaining symptoms are - Memory Loss - Cognitive decline - Numb feeling in head - occasional dizziness. - Hearing issues. - Eye floaters - Feeling worse in the night/ Morning Thank you -Current supplements I’m taking - Paleo Vegan diet - Black Seed Oil (7-27-18)✅ - Colloidal Silver (7-15-18)✅ - B12 (7-15-18)✅ - Lion’s Mane (7-25-18) ✅ - Garlic (7-25-18)✅ - Coconut Oil Pills (7-27-18)✅ - Super Omega 3’s (7-19-18)✅ - Uridine (7-27-18)✅ - Choline (7-27-18) ✅ - Phosphatidyl Serine (7-27-18)✅ - Tulang Honey ✅ - Olive Leaf Extract ✅	undiagnosed
Can anyone help piece together these symptoms?	I’m posting this on behalf of someone else. I’m not a Reddit user, but I’ve found that this is a good outlet for issues of this sort. I also want to be honest in saying that I don’t have the full spectrum of their symptoms/issues, however, I have a good base for asking you all here. I am also being as discreet as possible for certain reasons, but I am more than willing to discuss further through private messaging. They’ve been dealing with these issues for approximately 2 years. In the beginning, they traveled in search of an answer, and came up empty. They’ve progressively gotten worse to where they cannot do much other than small, basic, household tasks. They’re only able to lay in one position due to pain, their stomach is very sensitive to certain foods, and it is painful for them to eat. They’ve lost a great deal of weight and are EXTREMELY underweight. They’re losing hair as well. Bed sores have become a major issue because of their inability to lay in positions other than the one. They are not able to leave the house, and at this point have not been able to for approximately 2 years. It seems to have gotten to a point that this has caused depression and mental issues that are preventing them from wanting to seek any more medical attention, as well as they feel they are too weak and doctors will cause harm if they do seek out more help. I’m scared and worried because my loved ones are not wanting to push them into getting anymore help and are basically trying to make them as comfortable as possible until they die. They are around 40 years old, so this is something that hurts me deeply. They are too young for family to not want to do everything they can to help them. I hope someone can help me, and I hope you aren’t offended by my discreetness as I don’t know the reddit culture very well. This is something that is greatly affecting me personally and I decided to take matters into my own hands since no one else is willing to step up and do so. Again, I’m willing to answer any more personal in depth questions privately (reddit has that right?). Please help!!!	undiagnosed
Unexplainable illness, legs covered in now football sized wounds some 1/4 in. deep that do not heal and get bigger over time, and is slowly spreading to rest of body.	My sister has, for the last several years, had this condition where small wounds, can even be as small as scratching an itch, will get worse over time and not heal, eventually resembling large bumpy red burns, with currently about 70&#37; of her legs covered and just her legs, and just last week now one on her stomach. Presumably, a guess by a doctor, the capillaries are dissolving near the wound, causing less and less blood to get to the area, thus causing the wound to widen and deepen over time. It's a constant battle to keep them from getting infected, and we fear the worst if it ever does. Recently her fingernails have grown weak, they crack and split when trying to manipulate simple things like bending paperclips. She has seen and is currently seeing multiple doctors and for a time a panel of many, all to no avail. All tests come back negative, no parasites or evident viruses at play. Her veins are also very quick to collapse, she now has a port in her chest for easy access to blood for the occasional test. We get a 3' by 3' box of pads and gauze every week to keep the wounds covered. At this point I want to get this ridiculous story out there, but any suggestion at all would definitely be appreciated. Before this I guess it would be hard to impossible to imagine the pain of people with undiagnosable and probably fatal diseases, I can see how it would be so easy to feel forgotten by society with no help coming. Sad affair all around. Keep the spirits up and dreams happy guys!	undiagnosed
Eye Condition - Eyes Swell Shut - Chronic for 7 Years	Hi Reddit, This is my first time making a post. My life has been effectively destroyed by a medical condition that remains undiagnosed. Every few days one or both of my eyes have conjunctivitis (pink eye) symptoms that are so severe that one or both must remain closed after they basically swell shut. This started in 2011 when I found myself with pink eye and went to urgent care. I took some antibiotics and it went away. Over time, it happened more frequently and more violently. I've seen something like 6 or 7 eye doctors, seen ear nose and throat specialists, allergists, specialists that specialize in infectious diseases, surgeons that specialize in tear ducts (thought it was tear duct blockage for a while but apparently that just causes extra tearing) and countless GPs. Symptoms: 1. I start to feel pressure and discomfort in the corners of my eye. 2. Eye feels dry and eye starts to produce a discharge that's colored anywhere from clear to dark brown. The crusty stuff at first. 3. Eyelids start to swell and discomfort accelerates. 4. Discharge starts to go crazy and the only thing that makes the pain manageable is to close the eye entirely. 5. Discharge drains down my face, usually a green-brown color. 6. Pain and pressure start to get really bad and it's difficult to concentrate/sleep/etc. 7. Eyelids swell and the tissue around the area gets really inflamed. 8. Symptoms start to recede and gradually the eye returns to normal. It doesn't appear to be an allergy as I've completely moved from one environment to another, lived without a cat for 6 months, quit smoking for 6 months, slept on a couch in case I was allergic to memory foam, completely changed my diet and then back and a million other things. I'm also on antihistamine nasal spray and eye drops right now just to completely eliminate the possibility (it isn't helping). I've tried antibiotics over the course of entire year whenever I got initial symptoms and it does nothing. Steroids help with the healing process but you can't do that long term and it only helps a little bit. I have to wear mirrored sunglasses all the time because this is horrifying to look at. Anyone have similar experiences or have any ideas? I'm not sure what exactly to cover but I'm having no luck and the next step is to submit myself for some sort of study. Any help is appreciated, thanks!	undiagnosed

Seen Doctor, ER, and Gastro.... Still No Answers!	Hi, I'm Austin! Since June 20th 2016 I have been waking up every morning between 5 and 7 am writhing in pain and needing to run to the restroom. When I use the restroom it is usually an hour or two of hot lava spewing from my back end. In the beginning I threw up a lot but that has mostly subsided. After using the restroom, my stomach just hurts, feels bloated, gassy, and cramped. I have very little appetite, but once I do eat I fill up immediately. Then it is just a continuation of the stomach ache until morning where I repeat that schedule. What has been done so far: Gastric Emptying, stool sample, blood sample, CT scan, CT scan with iodine, gallstone ultrasound, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and I have a HIDA scan scheduled for next Friday, also waiting on the results of a food sensitivity blood test. Medications I am on: Zoloft, Xanax (only taken when travelling), dyciclomine, dexilant, vitamin d pills, IBguard / FDguard, and promethazine. Medications I have taken: everything above, xifaxan, assorted pro biotics, assorted anti biotics. Final notes: Things tend to be the worst in the mornings, I have tried cutting out certain foods, and am seeing a chiropractor weekly.	undiagnosed
Seen Over a Dozen Doctors and No Diagnosis Yet	"I've been poked and prodded, and scanned over the past 7 years, and still no diagnosis. I've completely lost trust in the competency of most doctors because of the unscientific way that most of them approach problems that they can't affix a quick label to and prescribe a pill for. My family, though for the most part is supportive, still makes frustrating and dismissive suggestions about what I need to do for my health. ""Oh, have you seen a naturopath?"" ""Maybe you're sensitive to gluten?"" ""I read this thing in this book, and it probably is migraines""... The list goes on and on. My husband thinks I'm being lazy when I don't want to go out because I'm so fatigued. Symptoms like numbness, weakness, confusion, and other vague and fleeting sensations just don't elicit the sympathy and understanding that a tummy ache or fever does, even though they can by symptoms of serious diseases. I am lucky to have great medical care now, and am gradually getting closer to a diagnosis. There are a lot of objective tests that still need to be done. I'm convinced now that this is not an unsolvable mystery, just doctors rely too much on subjective diagnostic criteria. I have lumps under my skin that need to be examined, and probably biopsied. I had a high white blood cell count in my spinal fluid several years ago. They need to do another lumbar puncture. There are still blood tests for certain cancers, and autoimmune disorders that they can do. I don't have MS, migraines, lupus, gluten intolerance, or a thyroid deficiency. These are things that have been tested for. What me and doctors are still going to look at is: Sjogrens, lymphoma, paraneoplastic syndrome, and the cancers that could cause it, sarcoidosis.. Sorry about my disorganized rant!"	undiagnosed
It's been 10 years for me.	I just wanted to say a few things. I'm glad Reddit has an undiagnosed subreddit, but I wish it was stronger. More posts, more users, etc. I have been on this trainwreck of a stumbling, fumbling journey for 10 long years. My disease has left me unable to work, despite my best efforts, and my state chose not to expand Medicaid. Clinics only help with the basics, and I don't qualify for charity programs. And a doctor has to submit each case to the Undiagnosed Diseases Program, and a doctor has to request genetic sequencing. There are very few reduced-cost copay programs, and I either don't qualify for them, or I have stumped the doctors there. So I don't qualify for any kind of health insurance. I can't get a diagnosis, because I can't get help. And I can't get help, because I don't have a diagnosis. This issue has nearly left me homeless. I've already done CrowdMed, and I've already emailed talk show hosts, started a GoFundMe campaign, emailed the White House and my governor, called every clinic in my state, tried to get a lawyer, all of it. And CrowdMed was the only thing that was helpful. Unfortunately, you have to get your CrowdMed diagnostic suggestion confirmed with a physician in person. Which I can't afford. So I'm still undiagnosed. Along the way, as I have dragged my carcass through this journey, I like to at least think that I have learned what works and what doesn't. I have had journalists publish articles about me, and I have published articles about my experience as well. But it doesn't do any good. Doctors either refuse to listen or refuse to help. Right now, I am going to a local reduced-copay doctor's office. He is wiling to conduct any test I need, but this doctor's office will be paying for it all out of pocket. They can't blow the entire budget on one patient, so they are limited. I am thinking about getting some blood tests from the University of Washington's Collagen Diagnostics Lab, (skin biopsy, TAAD panel, NSG panel) having UW bill me, then apply for UW's financial assistance program. I haven't had an income since 2008, so it should be a shoe-in. My next appointment is not until September 24th, and I am stuck just biding my time until then. Such is the never-ending struggling just to find out what's killing me. I have dedicated everything I have to trying to help myself, since no one else will. I have done all my own research, called, emailed, chased new leads, and followed up, all on my own. All while everyone around me constantly chastised me, minimized my illness, and told me I was just being lazy. All while trying to avoid homelessness. Thus concludes my rant for the day.	undiagnosed
Poor working memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, concentration, lethargy, lack of sad emotions, sluggishness, physical inflammation and weakness.	"**Symptoms:** - Bad working memory (cannot remember on the go, struggle forming sentences or finding right words, hard to do simple calculations) - Bad short-term memory (forget about something I planned to do or something that I already thought about, forget people's names, song names, words in general) - Bad long-term memory (Can't remember almost anything from my past) - Concentration (Hard to read a single sentence, hard to read something for a long time, hard to engage on conversations without thoughts coming in) - Brain fog (Sometimes I cannot think straight and have a cloudy mind) - Lethargy (I don't feel attracted to any superficial thing like normal people do E.g. any form of devotees, lack of motivation to do things or move from bed) - Lack of sad emotions (I never feel sad, angry, or emotional about anything. I do feel a lot of empathy, love, positivism. I always have a smile on my face and I'm really content with my life but the only thing that worries me is my inabilities but it is just fear for the future, it stresses me yet doesn't make me sad) - Sluggishness (I feel tired like I need more sleep most of the time) - Physical inflammation (Pain all over my body specially when sitting or standing for long periods of time, the pain subsides when cracking my bones but then it builds up again and sometimes it doesn't stop) - Weakness (Just overall weak E.g. I always have to use very mild weights at the gym and doing long exercises is difficult and my body gets a lot of inflammation post-workout) **My life story:** I'm a 20 year old guy that has struggled throughout my whole life specifically upon anything that involves a mind working task. I remember an outrageous small number of things that happened in my life. Most of them are since 4 years ago but anything before that is really hard to think about. The things that I remember has to be something really special or important that happened (this memories are not vivid, I just get a little visual feedback but not how everything happened) and the most vivid memories are from something that I shared with someone or thought much about (telling a story or daydreaming an event). Non of my memories fall under a timeline, I'm completely disoriented with time and at what stage I had an experience. E.g. I cannot assign a year, month, or day to any of my memories. Even for recent events is hard for me to think about what happened last week or even 1-2 days ago. Luckily is not like I completely lose my memories I can probably still remember if someone gives me a detailed explanation of what happened in that event. But I repeat, this is more pronounced in the last 4 years. It is like my brain is not able to function or remember without hints or external stimulation. And this only helps me remember the specific event not the period or the things that happened before or after that event. I was apparently a high distinction student till 3rd grade (I had probably 7-8 years old) and I have a faded memory that at 4th grade I couldn't ""apparently"" (I don't know if at that stage something happened to me or just the studies got out of my capabilities) focus anymore and it was really hard to study and do homework. Since then, I had bad grades and struggled to get through the school years. I've always been really scared of failure so since I was not able to concentrate I found my ways around it by plagiarizing or doing acceptable work that would keep me going but this was more like a flight or fight response while getting a crazy amount of stress for my inabilities. Somehow I managed to get through all my years without failing a single one. I had extension for some classes but still got through and at the last years of school I developed a really efficient way of plagiarizing and doing homework to just get that passable score. Because of this, my parents never got too worried about my performance and they didn't know I was doing all of this to get through. In this period I always thought I was ""too smart"" to be losing my time doing school work that will not help me in the future or ""too lazy"" because I didn't put the effort or responsibility upon them. Since I had a lot of free time from not doing homework, I got into computers and videogames and I was really skilled at it. The memory and concentration problem was still there but since it became my passion I would bring out the best out of me and just as clever as I was on plagiarizing I was clever on the computer. I began to think about the future and I was really convinced I would study something computer related and always kept on the back of my mind that when that time comes I'll stop being ""lazy"". Then the time came, I traveled abroad to study IT and that's where I began to realize all my inabilities. I had a strong motivation at the beginning and solely focused on my studies. As I began my degree I was getting HD on my assignments but not because I could concentrate or remember, I was lucky that the degree was mostly based on practical work and the only memorizing based work was quizzes and essays which again I ended up plagiarizing because I couldn't read and hated writing for the same reason. Even the practical work I would stress because I had to think and took me a long time to get started on doing it and while doing it I would rush through it to get over, but ended up landing really good grades. In this period I also started working for the first time, in a catering kitchen as a kitchen hand. And I was also lucky that it required almost not much thinking but my memory was the worst at this point. I would forget simple tasks they told me to do all the time but they were compassionate and they kept reminding me. Also I started getting nerve pain in my feet, inflammation in my knees, hips, back, neck, shoulders, hands and pretty much all my body from standing for too long. Here is where I got the most concerned about my physical and mental health and decided to do everything I could to feel better. I began exercising, doing yoga, meditating, taking supplements, started a healthy diet, 8+ hours of sleep, self-improvement and I began to feel a little bit better on behalf of my physical health, energy, mood and discipline. Also I began drinking coffee and it helped me slightly with my cognitive abilities and a lot with my short-term energy. Then when I thought I was ready to focus in my studies again, I started a calendar to organize myself where I encouraged to do an online course on Android development, got the course and assigned 2 hours a day to it. Starting from the first day, I sat down and tried to study but I still couldn't focus and got so irritated about it that I couldn't continue and set excuses about it that maybe it was because I didn't sleep well or maybe because I was drinking coffee in the morning and then I would crash in the afternoon and a number of ruminating thoughts about what is keeping me from focusing. This became a limbo and I never got better but I would keep trying until I remembered that I've always been like this and I cannot keep naturally trying to fix myself. That's when I began researching about ADD, SCT, Depression and I was so radical about it that I would read about anything that could be the culprit of my issues every single day while being a lurker. I ended up discovering Sleep apnea and all the symptoms where really similar to mine and I knew I had to get a sleep study to know if I had it specially because when I read about it I remembered 2 or 3 times that I woke up during the night gasping for air. At this point, I actually wanted to have it because that meant that I could get treatment even if I had to sleep with a mask but I just wanted to feel better and after the study it was not it. The sleep physician asked me why I took the study, I told him all my symptoms and he decided to prescribe me Mirtazapine (antidepressant) that he told me would make me sleep better and fix my concentration and memory issues. The next 2 months were the worst in my life I had even worse concentration and I felt like a living zombie everyday. Interestingly, I was having really vivid dreams and sort of began recalling small things about my past also my palms which are normally really sweaty were not much anymore but not anything more than that. Eventually the physician told me that Mirtazapine didn't work and that he cannot keep assessing me and that I needed to see a psychiatrist and he change my meds to Effexor. Since effexor I had a major improvement, my mood got really elevated, my short-term and long-term memory improved slightly and my social-anxiety was gone. I have been feeling really good ever since. I seek for a psychiatrist and it took me a 5 month wait to get an appointment . One month ago he ended up diagnosing me with ADD and Depression. And added dextroamphetamine on top of the effexor. Since, for the first time I've been able to sit down to do mental tasks but my memory is still very poor and that's why I'm still thoughtful about whether I have something else or maybe my brain got damaged for such a long time from being undiagnosed or maybe I have trauma that make my brain work non optimally. I just don't understand what could be the main cause. I have to point that my parents have apparently been really tough when I was young but I don't remember and my brother have a number of pathologies (Chemical Sensitivity, Electromagnetism sensitivity, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) I thought It was essential to tell my story to have a better understanding of my symptoms and maybe there's something important that can help understanding what's wrong. I am really thankful if someone managed to read everything and I would really appreciate any insight or thought anyone can give. **Current Meds/Supplements**: - Effexor 75mg - Dextroamphetamine 20mg - Vitamin D3 1000iu - NAC 600mg (Sometimes) - Just stopped taking Fish oil but I took it for 2 years - Glucosamine - Vitamin C (Just started) - Magnesium Glycinate (Just started)"	diagnoseme
