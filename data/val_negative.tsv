36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar. If you're on the same page, hit me up."	chat

Is P3 worth it despite getting spoiled?	"I got into the Persona series a couple of months ago and so far I'm loving it. Just finished P5 and now I'm about to finish P4 and after that I wanted to start playing P3 (more specifically, the Portable version for PS Vita). But just a couple of days ago, I got spoiled pretty bad by a random comment under a P4 OST video. It was about the death of the MC of P3 at the end of the game. Which leads to my question: ""Should I play P3 nonetheless?"". I know that this is a rather subjective topic but I'd like to hear your opinion. Is the story still good despite the spoiler, is this fact even only a little part of the ending or do the characters/gameplay compensate the rest?"	PERSoNA
MAGA (make Amagi great again)	Amagi got nerfed too hard. It was a great ship that took some knowledge to play well. Had her on the back burner for a long time and decided to play her today. Awful, horrible. It was bad after the initial nerf, but the current state of play is especially bad for this ship. Long range HE spam really eats her up. The armor isn‚Äôt good, the guns despite being 410s are not good, speed and handling very mediocre. Was my first T7 BB. Thinking im gonna sell her though, can‚Äôt see any reason to play her over an Iowa or JB.	WoWs_Legends

OK so I'm feeling kinda fucked.	"Last night I went out with the girl I 'm in love with, and I had told her that I had someone on my mind in a ""you know how"" way. We are friends for about 5 months now and she makes me feel happy, after a long time of me going through my life with a fake smile and getting out of bed with less and less exitement every day. Before we returned home, she hugged me for good night and I told her ""It's you"". She said ""I don't know what to say"" and I responded with ""You don't have to answer, it's just that the sooner I get it off my chest, the easier I'll move on with my life"" ( I know she has someone else in mind at the moment). Last thing she said was that she didn't want us to stop hanging out and talking, which I responded to with ""neither do I"". Lately, my mother and my brother fight quite regularly, so I can't cry at peace at home. She is the third person I have fallen in love with, and the third person who rejected me (although this time in a more mild way). I just hope I'll be able to act like normal around her from now on, so I can't lose the single thing making me smile and giving me strenght I know this is probably gonna get lost on ""new"" but what the hell. Sorry for any grammatical errors."	teenagers
Opinions for a newb	"First time poster here. I have a character concept that I was wondering how you guys would handle. This is my first M&M character, never played, and I'm excited to give it a shot! My basic idea is a guy who remotely controls a battlesuit style robot. He controls it from a sort of full body VR station that has limited range, so it is stationed on an air vehicle that is piloted by a minion. I'm probably using the control tech power from Power Profiles limited to the battlesuit. I will give it enhanced strength, flight, a strike power and a homing rockets power. (PL 10) I know this is a bit ""bathroom mentalist"", if I'm using that term correctly at all. So to negate that a bit, I am adding that the guy controlling the battlesuit/bot suffers the same fate as the battlesuit does. This might seem unnecessary but I really like the story implications of what is essentially remote control Iron Man. My question is, how would you guys roll this? Would you make the battesuit a construct? I'm VERY new to this. This might be a dumb concept but I'm curious as to how you'd roll it if you had to. Thanks for any and all insights!"	mutantsandmasterminds

Valorant review and why is csgo with powers	\[Don't hate me because this is just a review and I do like this game\] The Goal Of The Game Okay so this game is a 5v5 hero game where your main goal is to plant the spike at the enemy 3 bases or you can just kill the whole team both can be challenging for new players but not impossible but you will die quite a lot and like csgo you don't respawn which might be frustrating for some players. Gameplay: I have played about 20 hours of this game and got at least decent at it. The gameplay is fun but can be quick and slow with the rounds usually lasting me about 20-30 min each which still lasts longer then most guys. The game puts you in with both poor players and players that seem to have mastered the game and will easily punish you for any mistakes, this can be problematic for some but I kinda like it because if you started to get good you could feel it and it was a good feeling being able to have a win streak or being able to carry your team. Now lets get down team play, you are able to use the chat box but its not recommended because no will see it until the match is over because everyone else is focusing on the game. There are two other ways to chat with your team and that is to use the ping system or the best way chatting but in this game I have seen people use neither very much so far which is surprising because most other games like these have loads of people speaking. The Agents: The agents are Breach, Brimstone, Cypher, Jett, Omen, Phoenix, Raze, Sage, Sova, and Viper. So this game has a decent amount of agents that all feel different and I enjoy using pretty much all of them although I haven't mastered any of them yet but I do want to. I don't want to go into detail but I will leave a link at the end explaining what they do. Performance and Graphics: The games performance is good for my low end computer and it actually runs better then csgo, although some things look a bit worse mainly the guns which look poor but still decent enough to be passable although you won't want to look at them for long, this is a closed beta so I don't suspect every thing to look amazing. I personally think the agents look good and like how some of them look like Omen which looks cool. Everything Else: So here are just a couple of other things I want to point out and why its like csgo. So first they have skins which are stupidly expensive most would be fine if 5 maybe 8 dollars or less but instead even the most bland can be a total 25 DOLLARS, and some being $35 its stupid and needs to be priced lower especially since its closed beta. Now lets talk the famous anti-cheat, so it sucks not only do you have to restart your computer it goes to the level your operating system goes and its not okay for some random game to do and this needs to be changed also it hates drivers both my friend and me have a problem with this where it stops drivers from working which is weird. Next thing I like and hate are the twitch drops because you watch the streams that hopefully you have a streamer you like for 2 hours and then you might wait 2+ weeks to get it, I like it tho because you at least get to see the game first and it brings creators extra views and possibly new fans. And the last thing like csgo is the player base is pretty toxic with every match having someone being made fun of for not being good at this game even tho its quick play. So I give this game a 8/10 it being fun but not perfect but I do like this game more then csgo and if you like csgo I think there is a high chance of you liking this game.

Also ideally Big Law (would be open to clerking or something for a year but realize neither school has great clerkship stats).

System Security Flaw & Future Season Datamine	Good evening, My name is Dennis, and for the past two weeks I have been experimenting with an exploit inside Destiny 2's code to **gain access into a private resource archive inside Bungie's database**. As this is a security flaw, I will not dive into details; I have already contacted a Bungie representative so they may patch this flaw to avoid future datamined information. To protect my privacy, I am using a throwaway account. For some information, Destiny 2 directly connects to Bungie's authentication server which also provides headers to access local updates - these are the smaller patches that you may encounter in-game, however do require download outside of its execution (for example, through the Steam client). The software container that manages this authentication has a **serious flaw that allows anyone with a set of datamine skills to directly access private servers**. Humorously enough, this means you can access authentication servers without authentication. This allows you to view unreleased documentation and resources, including for upcoming releases. I believe this is the same exploit dataminer, Ginsor, used to leak Forsaken assets as they had explained that their source **was not an individual**. Despite contacting Bungie to warn them of the flaws exploitation, I have decided to leak a snippet of what I saw in the database - the next seasonal content, titled [**Season of Hope**](https://i.imgur.com/ZBe7Za4.jpg). This season returns players to the Dreaming City as the **curse is emitting fluctuations and the Vanguard believe that something sinister is going on**. I am unsure of how this links with the current season, however believe that the ending to this season may share some insight. The database contains what appears to be a print of a simplified work-breakdown structure (WBS), which from what I could make out leads me to believe that this season has had more employees working on it then all other seasons this year. Furthermore, this season does not rely on the grind for play, but instead revolves around exploration of the Dreaming City, and a new section of it, titled the **Conduit of Visions**. Inside this new area you will find many secrets, with new paths opening every week; In terms of atmosphere, this appears to be similar to the Corridors of Time from Season of Dawn. A low-quality document, which I was able to loosely translate from French, leads me to believe that **this season will include the infamous fifteen wish** as a device that will further the existing plot. The screenshot I found, linked above, appears to be taken from a work-in-progress trailer. Obviously, this is not all the season will offer - this is what I have found. In addition, I can conclude that the big expansion later this year will involve the darkness ships (no surprise there), however the ongoing plot that was hinted throughout next year will be based on the events of Season of Hope, and appears to **involve characters such the hinted Savathun**. The database also lists a new character named Aran-19, whose name resembling a hunter is the only information I have on them. Unfortunately, the majority of the documentation is subject to non-disclosure agreements, and leaking them would get me in serious legal trouble. The screenshot above is all I feel comfortable sharing. Furthermore, I understand if this information may cause doubt in the community of its legitimacy. Nothing I can do will influence your mindset, so I suggest waiting to see. Thank you for providing a platform to share this information.	raidsecrets

My adderall is helping me but I feel burnt out and with such busy....	I started this new job recently and the hours have gone up which is good the thing is that the schedules are hectic, they rotate too much, my sleep schedule is off and for the last week I have been sleeping 4 hours max or less. Anyway I have bipolar disorder also, so sleep disturbances really affect me as it is, however I have managed because I have to. The thing is I'm burnt out, the jobs I'm getting are also physically demanding so that's another dimension of it. I'm happy for the pay especially with the situation as it is and how I can use this hard time to make more money and save since spending is limited at the moment due to Covid. The issue is it's getting so bad I'm not functioning my best and my mind and body are taking a toll. I hardly eat, I am constantly going home doing chores then get done and only have 4 hours to sleep to start over. I'm taking my adderall daily but that adds to the physical side effects, because I'm so drained instead of skipping doses as I used to now I find myself needing them daily. I'm tired of it and need a break but between that and coffee for the time being I have no idea what I can do in such a situation. I haven't been working out, eating, sleeping, doing anything not to mention I'm getting paid less than I ever have for harder work, yet cannot do anything about it. Yet I'm grateful that while hard some self sacrifice will be worth it. Does anyone feel like this? Like wanting to take a longer break but not being able to because taking that break while so busy your priorities will collapse?	adderall

Special Ammo Economy needs a tune up, Special weapons don't need nerfs.	I have been seeing a lot of posts asking for nerfs to various special weapons like Bastion, MindBenders, Revoker, Erentils, Joutuun(for some reason) and ofcourse MountainTop. But IMO, special weapons aren't that broken now(Revoker is an exception), sure snipers could use a tune up in AimAssist and Flinch and mountainTop Sticky could be tuned too. But none of these things would stand out this much if Special Ammo wasn't so abundant in this game, hell in most Survival and 6v6 you can pretty much run nothing but you Special the entire round because of how much ammo you get and I have done similar things in Trials too, Special Ammo Economy needs to be toned down, I have a few ideas.. Tweaks to the existing system. *. Instead of 2 ammo, starting ammo should be turned to 1. *. Allied Guardian Deaths shouldn't drop Special Ammo, this way special starvation would be thing If the enemy don't run Specials. *. Max Scavenger pickup should be limited to 2 rounds, not more than that. *. Special Ammo shouldn't carry over to rounds....i don't understand this decision ? Why would you help snowballing in competitive modes ? *. Reviving allies should give them special Ammo.	DestinyTheGame

Extremely slow speeds (95 down/65 up) when suppose to be getting gig even with all new equipment	So starting last week I was getting extremely slow speeds. I troubleshooted my equipment (unifi) and everything was fine. I go to the router and noticed that I would still get less than 100 down when directly connected to the router. I called ATT and they ran tests and said I was getting 950 to the router so it must be my equipment. I informed them that I was getting the same 100 down with all my equipment disconnected so they said they would send a new router. The next day I lost all internet all together so they sent a tech out yesterday. &#x200B; The tech replaced the router, ONT, new ethernet connectors on the wire running from router to ONT and reprovisioned my account. When he was done I was back to my 850-950 range. &#x200B; Woke up this morning and back to 100 down. I again, tested on the router and same speeds. I power cycled everything, changed out ethernet to my equipment and tested a brand new ethernet wire on my laptop. I used a cable tester on the cable from the router to the ONT and no issues. When I run tests on ATT website it shows no issues. When I do a speedtest on the router, it gives me 950 range. However when I do a speedtest from a laptop connected to the router I am at less than 100. My setup: Motorola BGW210-700: 2g and 5g radios off, IP Passthrough to my unifi equipment. &#x200B; Any thoughts to look into? Going to try and call them again today but, while they are doing the best they can, speaking to the Lev 1 tech support gets me nowhere (The first person I spoke to was trying to explain that my slow internet was because my 2g and 5g wifi radios were off).

Cheer me up please :)	Sorry for any spelling mistakes I just need to rant. 2020 let me down hard. Of course this goes for everyone. The only thing that kept me going during quarantine was school and now I'm done. I didn't even make the final exams cause they were cancelled. And now I graduated? There was no official moment or something we just had to figure it out ourselves. So obviously I told my parents and they werent very happy. They told me, eventhough I have no fail marks, I should try to redo a few tests to improve my marks. Isnt this good enough?? I feel like I didn't deserve this. I could never passed this year if it was a regular one. I'll probably will be stuck inside until college starts instead of travelling around Europe and visiting festivals. And next week, It's my birthday. I Always imagined my 18th birthday party as the best party of my life. Finally able to do everything and party all night with my friends. Well, that's not gonna happen either. It will just be me and my parents drinking a (1) beer together in our house. So please guys, how do I deal with college stress, being stuck inside with nothing to do and birthdays during quarantiane and disappointed parents?	teenagers
I'm curious to know what the lineup for Primavera Sound Los Angeles would have looked like.	It's the middle of May, and I doubt they will announce a lineup, but if they did, they'd likely have done so around this time, right? The mayor of Los Angeles has been vocal about not having any concerts or festivals for the remainder of the year as well, and anyone thinking rationally will have already come to the conclusion this festival isn't happening. My questions are: * I wonder what the lineup would have looked like? * Will they bother announcing the lineup before cancelling it? * How long will it be until they officially make the announcement that it is cancelled?	primaverasound

Slipped yet again	What do you know? I tried to keep from drinking on my own, and it didn't work. Nothing went according to plan yesterday, and I really pissed off my partner. I thought I would try some controlled drinking, just to be sure, and blacked out. Based on my experience, I will know not to drink for a month or so before I end up with the bottle. I would love to hear some encouraging words from anyone who failed many times before achieving long term sobriety, also, any recommendations are welcome.

I (M) Like To Finger My Ass	Over the weekend, the wife was gone visiting her family. I stayed home and told her I had some work to do. Once she left I turned on some porn and slowly started to stroke my cock. I've recently gotten more into edging so I took it slow. Then I put some lube on my finger and started playing with my ass. I again took it slow, only making circles around my hole. I played with my balls and taint and started to relax. Once I was relaxed enough, I stuck my finger in my ass. I continued to stroke my cock while I fucked my ass with my finger. It felt amazing. Not long after I knew I was going to cum so I shoved my whole finger in as I came. It was an amazing orgasm. Now I just need to convince the wife to do it to me and probably buy a prostate massager.	SluttyConfessions
The Next Covid Crisis Could Be a Wave of Suicides	The isolation, grief and economic hardship related to Covid-19 are creating a mental health crisis in the U.S. that researchers warn could make the already-rising suicide rate worse. A study [released Friday](https://wellbeingtrust.org/) tried to quantify the toll. The paper, which was not peer-reviewed, found that over the next decade as many as 75,000 additional people could die from ‚Äúdeaths of despair‚Äù as a result of the coronavirus crisis, a term that refers to suicides and substance-abuse-related deaths. The research was done by the Well Being Trust and researchers affiliated with the American Academy of Family Physicians. ‚ÄúI hope in 10 years people look back and say, ‚ÄòWow, they way overestimated it,‚Äô‚Äù said John Westfall, director of the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care, who co-wrote the report. Even as the American economy rebounded after the last recession, suicides and overdoses cut into Americans‚Äô life expectancy. Mental health experts worry that the economic uncertainty and social isolation of the pandemic will make things worse at a time when the health care system is already overwhelmed.

High level advice for what platform to use next	"After finishing my move to hubitat i wanted to share some advice. wanted to give a high level oversimplification of some of the options out there. i see people jumping from wink on this sub and hubitat forums and twitter and elsewhere and complaining about what wink is and how to find something that works that way still. First identify how you use wink today, and how you want to use ""automation"" if today you use wink as a universal remote control, being that you turn on and off things with voice, or the wink app. and dont use robots for anything you may want to look at simple solutions. the first simple solution is go wifi only. ditch zwave and zigbee, go with devices that work with echo or google home, and don't require a hub. And use voice and the alexa or google home app for control. you can also use those apps to build out basic automatons. This gives you the Easiest path to a universal remote. But does have lots of drawbacks. you are cloud dependent, you are depended on a bunch of small apps and integrations. but this works. The second option is to build on what is up above. you can buy a Amazon show and use some zigbee devices, you can buy into a platform like smart things and use both zwave and zigbee. amazon show option is still super easy. the smart things option you start to move away from the ""universal remote automation"" and have a device that takes a little more tech knowledge. this now gives you the ability to start customizing what you are doing, and moving from a glorified remote control, to a automation system. you can select device drivers, you still have an app you can use, you can still tie into alexa and google home. but you can also build more complicated routines. you also can use a lot more products. But you are still tied to the cloud. Leaving smart things the next step up is hubitat, you can now call this full automation. its ability to build out rules and automate your house is currently best in the game. you still have the ability to do voice assistants, but that is an after thought. everything is controlled locally at your house, you have to do everything manually. if you want a app you can have one but you have to build it, you build the dash boards that go on it, with what devices etc. the local control and flexibility, and compatibility is superior to anything else. but if you want a ""universal remote"" and not for all your lights to do something only on tuesdays between 6 and 7 and only if the front door is unlocked and its an average of 78* in your house. then avoid hubitat."	winkhub

ContraPoints‚Äô theory of cringe - what motivates us to snark?	Natalie Wynn aka ContraPoints posted a really excellent video yesterday called [‚ÄúCringe.‚Äù](https://youtu.be/vRBsaJPkt2Q) She draws a distinction between embarrassment cringe and contemptuous cringe - essentially, cringing with someone vs cringing AT them. Watching the video I couldn‚Äôt help but think of the CC snark community, and by the end I was feeling rather morally implicated myself, and was definitely left questioning what I am doing on this sub and why I follow caroline. If you have an hour and a half to spare (and let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs quarantine baby, most of us have nothing but time), I highly recommend checking the video out. There has already been a bit of discussion on the general thread, but I really think there is so much to talk about here. I‚Äôll copy/paste a bit of what I said in the general: I also felt like a lot of what she talked about could be related to caroline and the snark community, especially her idea of ‚Äúmorbid cringe‚Äù where hate following becomes an obsession. I know watching an hour and a half video of kind of a big ask for some but I would really like to hear what people here have to say about their motivations for snarking after watching CP‚Äôs cringe vid. CP makes the case that a lot of people who hate follow a cringe figure do so because that figure reminds them of something they dislike about themselves, which she calls in group cringe. Personally I think there‚Äôs a bit of truth to that last point because I do suspect most of the people in this community are also white women. (Btw has there ever been a demographics type poll on here? There should be.) But I don‚Äôt think that can neatly explain why snarkers snark. People outside the subreddit sometimes come in and say we‚Äôre basically all just jealous of her, and although I think there‚Äôs more to it than that I also think there‚Äôs a shred of truth to that statement as well. The most common sentiment I see on here is basically ‚ÄúI work so much harder than CC but I don‚Äôt have what she has, and that‚Äôs not fair.‚Äù I feel like that comes closer to what strikes a nerve with most people on here. Even though it‚Äôs a CC snark subreddit, it‚Äôs almost about more than CC - she‚Äôs almost like an avatar for the general phenomena of unearned privilege, toxic white womanhood, failing upward, etc. So the in group cringe idea is not quite right here because I don‚Äôt think most people here are reminded of themselves by CC, but I DO think that for most of us she does hit on some sort of insecurity or frustration about our own life circumstances. But let me know what y‚Äôall think. ________ As someone pointed out in the general thread, I think for most of us our initial knee jerk response is to distance ourselves from the cringe trolls Natalie references in her video, or even from the other people on this subreddit - ‚Äúwell I haven‚Äôt done x y z so I‚Äôm not as bad as them.‚Äù But the fact of the matter is we all come together here to essentially make fun of a deeply mentally ill woman, and that‚Äôs never going to be a 100% morally righteous thing. However, unlike the trolls in CP‚Äôs video, and despite what people unfamiliar with the sub would probably think, I actually believe the people here can be trusted to have an intelligent, self aware discussion about why we are actually here and what we get out of snarking on CC. So I encourage you all to share your thoughts here. üòä	SmolBeanSnark

Replacement Battery for 2016 Mazda 3 (US spec, currently living in Europe)	Pretty much what it says in the subject line- I own a US spec Mazda 3 i Touring, does not have i Eloop, so far as I'm aware, and I'm currently living in France. I managed to leave the map light on the last time I drove the car, and between COVID-19 and the fact that we really only use the car for road trips and big grocery outings, it sat in the garage for a week, until I went to drive it today and found it dead. I tried jumping the battery with zero success, so I'm guessing that at this point, it's dead and needs to be replaced. I'm now looking around on Amazon and some car parts sites, trying to figure out which type of battery I need, but I'm having some trouble figuring out which batteries will be compatible with the car. If I just take the measurements of the current battery, will pretty much anything that fits in the tray work with the car, or are there other factors I should keep in mind? Am I going to run into issues using a European battery in a US car? The car is dead in our neighborhood parking garage, so ideally, I'd like to buy a new battery and do the replacement myself, rather than pay for towing, labor, having to discuss mechanical issues in French at a garage, et cetera, but I don't want to ruin the car, either. Thanks in advance for any help or advice!	mazda3
Running Man Member Injuries	I believe it is now known to most of us that RM members have suffered significant injuries while filming RM and thus, and justifiably so, they don't do the same physical activities they've done before.

Final Fantasy-esque book recommendations?	Hey, I posted this over in r/fantasy too but thought I would do so here as well to see if I can pick up any additional recommendations. **Specifically, what I'm looking for is a book with, like many FF games, an ensemble cast of distinct characters with strong personalities; a feeling of friendship, teamwork and fun; and a character-driven epic quest.** My favourite FFs are VI and IX so **my preferred flavour is high fantasy / steampunk, but I'm not AS interested in the flavour as those elements above.** In other words airships are optional, and only an added bonus. I'm more interested in the elements listed above. So far the books that I have read that hit this most are * The Chronicles of Prydain * The Aeronaut's Windlass (clearly inspired by FFVI and Skies of Arcadia, among other things) * A fanfiction novelisation of FFVI... * and, weirdly, Brian Bendis' New Avengers comic run: an amazing example of ensemble cast characterisation, IMO. Things already on my TBR list from research so far are: * Sufficiently Advanced Magic and stuff by Andrew Rowe * Ember in the Ashes * Kings of the Wyld (Reading this now. Absolutely excellent!) * Seven Blades in Black * Dragonlance * Rogues of the Republic * Stuff by Chris Wooding Anyone got any more?	FinalFantasy
Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2 - Most Essential Everyday Jacket Review (YouTube)	Hi all, Posted this review in the Arc'teryx sub with positive responses, and thought I share in the BIFL sub as it definitely qualifies. When people think of Arc'teryx, they usually associate the brand with Climbing, Skiing, Hiking and maybe even Trail Running or Biking. And those that are very familiar Arc'teryx know that their products are some of the most expensive outdoor apparel but built with high standards of quality and perhaps the best warranty in the business, that makes the product you've invested in truly BI4L. However, what most people do not know that Arc'teryx also sells high quality military spec'd products to Law Enforcement and Armed Forces (LEAF). And one of the most popular jackets from Arc'teryx, the Atom LT, has a LEAF version, the Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Gen 2, which can be used as an everyday BI4L spring/fall and mild winter jacket. Below is a 2 Part comprehensive YouTube Review of the Arc'teryx LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2, outlining why it should be considered the best most essential everyday spring/fall jacket. **Part 1** \- Outlines MUST and SHOULD Criteria and Candidates for Comparison [https://youtu.be/MLVf0gC7rAs](https://youtu.be/MLVf0gC7rAs) **Part 2** \- Visual and Hands On Review \- Comparison of Product Feature Differences and Advantages over the civilian Atom LT Hoody \- Hood, Shell, Liner comparisons vs other Arc'teryx jackets \- Fit and Layering Options \- Pros and Cons Summary [https://youtu.be/H8GtwJ2uizs](https://youtu.be/H8GtwJ2uizs) Please forgive the length of each video, as I wanted to be thorough in the comparisons and provide as much detail covering all the key technical aspects and benefits for the everyday user of the LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2, as there are not too many reviews on this jacket. Feel free to comment either here or in the YouTube comments section; and whether there are other jackets that should have been considered based on the criteria or have any questions on the LEAF Atom LT Hoody Gen 2 jacket itself. Cheers!	BuyItForLife

What are some debunked theories that you're glad were wrong?	To me, the theory that the Yonko had no bounties always made absolutely no sense at all. The only idea behind it was that the Yonko were too strong for any bounty hunters to defeat them, but that just doesn't logically follow with how the World Government operates. First of all, that's basically an admission that these people are too powerful for the World Government to defeat, and that they're more or less above the law. This completely doesn't vibe with the sense of absolute control over the world that the WG likes to front. Secondly, these people weren't *born* Yonko, they *became* Yonko. Meaning they had long careers of piracy before reaching the status, and would have accumulated a bounty. Would the world government just rescind someone's bounty because they feel like nobody can handle them? Or would they put a big price on their heads in the hopes that someone incredibly strong, or maybe a group of incredibly strong people, would go out and bring them in? The whole theory was just completely illogical, and it was a good day when the chapter came out that revealed Blackbeard's bounty. How about you guys? Any theories that you are glad didn't come true?

Hey, Comrades. I'm an Iranian Socialist and I would love to answer anyone who has a question about Iran, Islam, and the Middle-East.	So, I've encountered many left-leaning people who were really misinformed about Iran mainly because there's simply too much misinformation and bias about my country and well-educated Iranians who can communicate with the westerners aren't really helpful either. So, I thought I should do this to clarify some questions you beautiful people might have. I'm a 23-year old, pansexual man. I'm an atheist and a democratic socialist.	socialism
Integration with iTunes and/or Rythmbox	I‚Äôm currently in the process of switching from Linux, though at the moment I use a semi-broken MacBook running in a handicapped state of sorts. That‚Äôs all besides the point though. I was wondering if theres a way to use Jellyfin to listen to music through Rythmbox on Linux or iTunes on macOS. If possible, I‚Äôd prefer to have it work via a sync system where music from Jellyfin is cached locally, so I can listen offline. However, I open to any solutions or resources.	jellyfin

Women are so backwards.	"Hey, I am a 19 year old dude. I was a super late bloomer. Was Ugly all my life, now that I have 'Glowed up', my life has completely changed.

I used to be super ugly in highschool, so that was a surprise. \-Going out shopping, I can see the differences in the way women treat me. \-I went to get a Krispy Kreme doughnut, and the woman ""Chose the biggest ones out just for me"", and gave me two extra doughnuts. \-I get window seats in nice restaurants, and get discount coupons. \-I get extra sausages and mash potatoes for breakfast from the woman behind the cafe desk in the mornings. \-I get free drinks at the pub on Friday nights. \-All the girls working at my local starbucks know me somehow? And they give me like 4 free coffee stamps whenever I get a coffee. &#x200B; There is so much more that I can say. I am so disgusted that I am getting this treatment just because of the way that I look now. &#x200B; I know I shouldn't be pissed but seriously, this world is fucked up.

What age were you when you started to pursue a CRNA degree?	Hello! Just curious, at what age did everyone receive their CRNA degree? I am currently enrolled in nursing school and at the very beginning chapter of my journey into nursing. I just turned 35, that being said, by the time I graduate and hopefully gain some critical care experience, I probably would be in my early to mid 40‚Äôs, by the time I would be qualified to start applying to CRNA school (as this is the direction I am looking to pursue). Is this a common age range, or would I be on the older end of the spectrum? Just curious to hear what other people‚Äôs experiences have been. Thanks!	CRNA

Conspiracy of Kings re-read, Chapters 6-8	These chapters are short, so I decided to do three this week. Take a deep breath, we're about to approach the crossroads of fate! # CHAPTER SIX >Maybe I don‚Äôt know which Gen is real. But I know there was nothing feigned about his emotions after he had been beaten. > >Where, I wondered, was *my* wounded pride? Where was my outrage? My self-respect? Nowhere, it seemed. My back hurt. I lay there on my pallet, hoping it would improve soon and wondering, in a distant, unreproachful way, if I was any kind of man at all, and decided that I probably wasn‚Äôt. Sophos tells the story that his tutor told him of Morpos‚Äôs choice -- where a young man stumbles upon a temple in the woods, bares his throat to the wolf that guards it, and then takes the wolf away with him as the gift from the goddess of the temple. Then he intervenes to stop the beating of another slave, Dirnes, by a soldier he runs into by accident. The soldier visits the slave barracks and complains about Sophos. So Ochtos, the overseer, beats Sophos to punish him. Dirnes is upset (‚Äúslaves don‚Äôt do favors for other slaves‚Äù) but they reconcile over an iced cake. Spring comes, and one day he looks up and sees his father on the road. # CHAPTER SEVEN >What would I choose if I could have anything? Well, I wouldn‚Äôt be useless. I would be the statesman my father wanted and the prince my country needed. But that wasn‚Äôt what I was offered. I was still the same poor excuse for a prince that I had always been. Quite likely I would fail to be of any use at all--to my father or anyone. When the rebelling barons were put down, I would see my uncle marry and produce an heir far superior to me, and I would be despised as useless and unwelcome even in my own home. That was what I was choosing. > >I wonder if people always choose what will make them unhappy. Sophos considers the choice before him -- even briefly dreaming of his tutor asking him what he wants -- and then before dinner that night leaves the slave barracks. He punches a house boy and then takes his shirt in order to sneak into the megaron and beg Berrone for help. He spins her a story of woe and she helps him to misdirect the steward and get a new shirt so he can serve his father‚Äôs men at the dinner that night. Berrone‚Äôs brother comes in and reveals that the men are going to wear knives to dinner that night. # CHAPTER EIGHT >I lifted the lightweight stable boy on my own, even as I asked Ochto what in the name of all that was sacred he thought he was doing. > >‚ÄúHelping you,‚Äù said Dirnes. > >‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù > >They put the soldier down, and Ochto straightened to look me in the eye. ‚ÄúBecause I know nothing about kings and princes, but I know men.‚Äù > >‚ÄúAre you *mad*?‚Äù I asked. Sophos serves wine around the dinner table and warns his father of Hanaktos‚Äôs impending attack. Then he goes around to warn the other men to be ready when he drops the amphora. He runs quickly down to the stables to get the horses ready so they can flee, but gets interrupted by the soldier who once caused him to be beaten. Ochto and Dirnes come to the rescue. Sophos returns to the dinner, but the houseboy he punched is there now -- he‚Äôs waiting for Sophos with armed men to drag him away and keep him from dropping the amphora.They fight, the amphora drops, and then a giant brawl breaks out as they all make their escape from Hanaktos and his men. # COMMENTARY So Sophos is just about to get to a critical juncture in his story -- when he has to make a choice between staying a slave or not -- and he interrupts himself to tell the story of Morpos‚Äôs choice instead. This is a story told to him by Moira and he thinks about it a lot, so you know it‚Äôs also got to be important to the overall story and to his character. So you‚Äôve had some time to ponder since I last introduced the question: Who or what is the wolf? Sophos indicates later on that he thinks the wolf is Attolis. He surrenders his sovereignty to Attolis like Morpos offers the wolf his throat. Then, just as the wolf protected Morpos from the bandits, Attolis provides the men and resources necessary to win back his country from the rebels. And this is certainly what happens in the story, but I also think there‚Äôs another layer of thematic meaning. I think about this a lot and I go back and forth, but largely I settle on one of two ideas: The wolf is *true masculinity.* It is Sophos‚Äôs own desire for power and aggression -- the long-suppressed masculine side of his nature, if you will. He has to accept it and submit to it to survive to even get to the temple to make the choice. Then he has to choose what to take with him from the temple. He could take the sword (which represents the cultural expression of masculinity -- which will result in a life full of blood and conflict) or the gold (the intellectual path he has chosen thus far, which will ultimately leave him with nothing) but he chooses the wolf. He chooses to forge his own path, fraught with risks, but also with potential. My other theory, which contradicts the other, is that the wolf is *the risk of* *failure*. Sophos endlessly berates himself for his own failures and lives in fear of more failures. The life of a slave is the one time he is released from failure because nobody expects anything of him. But once he surrenders to it, accepts it, is willing to risk it, he can start moving on. He takes it with him and it may turn on him -- he COULD actually fail and even expects to fail -- but it‚Äôs better than his other options. I think you could also make arguments for many other concepts. Basically, the temple represents the crossroads of fate -- you get there without planning on it, without being aware of what is coming -- but the choice you make will be key to the rest of your life. Don‚Äôt be careless about making that choice! So, back to the other things that happen in these chapters: It‚Äôs very fitting that Sophos gets promoted to wall-building. It is both an intellectual and physical activity, so it‚Äôs a sign he‚Äôs coming into balance. It‚Äôs also, perhaps, a metaphor for being a king -- how an accumulation of small decisions build into something large and enduring. Oh, and for Sophos‚Äôs self-descriptions, there‚Äôs not much new in these chapters: he adds ‚Äúan unruly slave‚Äù, ‚Äúa field hand‚Äù, ‚Äúa failure as a man, a prince, and a son‚Äù, ‚Äúthe same poor excuse for a prince that I had always been‚Äù and ‚Äúa poor lost soul‚Äù (when enlisting Berrone‚Äôs help). So he‚Äôs back to being really hard on himself, especially as he makes the choice to leave the easier life as a slave. You can see my pull quotes for these chapters are all pretty woeful. He's so hard on himself! To go more into the first quote, from Chapter 6, he really beats himself up over not throwing a tantrum when he‚Äôs beaten by Ochto. It kind of makes me want to hit my head against the wall -- how does he not see that the stoicism he shows is actually *incredibly* manly? To take a beating he doesn‚Äôt deserve in order to save a friend from that same beating, to not cry about it, to be able to say, okay, my back hurts but my pride and my ego are fine -- that‚Äôs a very adult way to behave. An explosive temper is not what makes a man. (Though many of the men in his life DO have dangerous and explosive tempers, and that has contributed, in my opinion, to many of Sophos‚Äôs problems.) These chapters are short, but there‚Äôs a lot in them. What stuck out to you?	queensthief

VIP 14 or Books of Covenant to rush T5?	I'm a mid-tier spender (growth fund, monthy gem supply, recharge events, and a few daily chests).I just got VIP12 and I have the gems to go just to vip 13 (around 150k gems).I'm only spinning wheels 10 times , as I still don't know for sure my troop orientation and my target commanders, and that's why I wanted to focus on getting as many universal heads as I can.So my objective was always vip 14.But as a ch25, I just realised I will soon be out of buildings to upgrade for a long time if I don't upgrade my castle which is still level 18 ( I am missing around 163k gems worth of books) . the rate I acquire books is very low (I recently started doing forts as much as i can and get around 50 books per day, so I will need more than 320 days to gather all books for free).Plus I want the extra 7% research speed the level 25 academy will give me, as I still have a heap of research to do before T5, and more than a year of universal speedups (not enough for T5 still, but I am acquiring many speedups from alliance gifts every day, because I'm in a spenders' alliance). So I'm in a dilemma: 1. will I use a large amount of gems on books when my building comes to a halt, in order to win valuable research time and get sooner to T5? but on the same time, lose months of vip 14 (and thus a corresponding amount of gold heads), or 2. use it only on vip and just ramp up on forts. as a result, in the long run I would have a few hundreds gold heads more, but I would lose a lot of research time, and my building would be at a halt for months, and T5 would come many months or even more than a year later. My aim is to kick some asses in war, and for this I need both T5 AND expertised top tier legendaries. I know everyone thinks differently, so I'm not asking you what to do.I'm asking what would you do in my position.	RiseofKingdoms

Threatening Jury Votes Strategy	"This is a strategy I've wondered about while rewatching RI and other seasons and I don't know of it's even allowed. After the merge in RI, Ometepe is up 7-5 and vote out one of their own. Now 6-5, Zapatera works like crazy to try and get one of them to open up their eyes and see that they are brainwashed robots. Alas, they don't and the get Pagonged. My idea for a strategy is this: After the first Zapatera member gets picked off and the numbers are 6-4, they see the writing on the wall and are pretty much sitting ducks. They know Rob is completely in control and brainwashed his fellow 5 Ometepe members. What if they go up to Rob and say, ""We know you're in control, if you don't take put a few Ometepe people before you tale all of us out, the 4 of us will vote against you at FTC."" Let's just say it's not a bluff and they will follow through with it. That would force Rob to do something, because if someone is definitely getting 4 votes at FTC, then all they need is 1 more and hes screwed. I've only seem s1-22 and s38-40. Has this strategy ever been used or thought of? Is it allowed? What are your thoughts?"	survivor

So after 7+ Months of no contact and 9+ months after she broke up with me I finally texted my ex 2 days ago	"And after exchanging texts over a couple days I can honestly say I have no interest in her anymore. For full context, I reached out because I reached a point where I was healed enough so that anything she could say wouldn't hurt me. Dealing with the breakup was one of the most emotionally taxing things I've had to do so this was a big deal for me. Anyway, she was excited to hear from me initially which was good but after we talked a little bit it became clear she kind of sucks now. All she does is play animal farm, go on picnics, and work. Of course is totally fine but very much not my thing. Also she felt the need to talk down to me despite still working a minimum wage internship and a second job while I managed to advance my career pretty far since we broke up which bothered the hell out of me. I guess it was very clear she was still in a college mindset. And all of this just fed into my prior frustration with her that she calls herself an ""empath"" because she likes to present herself as super caring and what not but its all performative and self serving. Eventually the conversation just fizzled out but the conversation is not my point. My point is that we get our closure from the weirdest places. The chances are your ex is no longer the person you loved or even you're not the person they loved. I think I'll always love her but its clear we're incompatible. Now I'm not saying go and text your ex, I waited a VERY long time before reaching out. But just know that if you reached out the interaction would have gone very similar to mine. With that said, thanks for reading and feel free to DM me if you need anyone to talk to who's been through what your going through :)"	BreakUps

Next day, same thing happens, put in a glass box when he tried to play with his friend. He asked his friend why he keeps doing that, and his friend said my kid ""griefs too much"". My kid logged off again and was upset he couldn't play with this friend. He came to my wife and I, and asked what does ""griefing"" mean. I said i have no idea (in the context of the game). I tried googling it, but figured I'd take my situation to the Reddit community itself. What does ""griefing"" even mean in Minecraft terms? How can my kid stop doing this griefing? What's up with the glass box? Is that a Minecraft thing too? Sorry for all the questions that I should know the answers to. I play online too, but don't play with tons of people. I usually play solo and have no idea what this lingo is. Thanks!"	Minecraft
I don't know what to do.	"So.... With the corona virus going on in my home country and we're currently in lockdown staying at home with my family members is actually making me have depressive episodes more often. I kept thinking of all the bads that associates to this place I try to call ""home"" is really taking a toll on me. I feel like for an Asian family my household is really really abnormal here are some of the craziest shit my family did to me. My aunt forced me to smoke a puff of her cigarette when I was younger(about 6). My uncle ""disciplined"" me into learning things that's not even in school like writing Buddhism scripts that's not even in Chinese(my native language) My brother tried to force himself on me when i was 10 and I still remember it vividly 10 years later. We share a room with my grandmother and it pains me to be in her knowing it almost took place in this room. My mother is not senile yet she doesn't even remember my name and always calls me by my younger sister name. My younger sister pins all her faults on me which the adults just side with her despite me being the most excellent academically out of my siblings. I was accused of stealing money which I never did because of my ""cosplaying hobby"" I tried to open up to relatives that's close to me about all these depressive thoughts but they kept giving the excuse of ""you so young where got depression"" I'm having home based learning and since my father sets up our home pcs literally in a straight line in the living room I can't focus on the one thing that made me feel alive -my academics. I don't know if it's normal to cry and breakdown everyday having weird heart palpitations, nosebleeding puddles of blood enough to cover my bathroom occasionally but I just don't know what to do..... Why do I feel so sad so miserable. I've tried going to counsellor or rather the school called them for me and they always give the same words of ""do you want me to call your parents "" as if they know anything at all. I'm just so tired from dawn to dusk everyday.... I don't even have close friends dear to me... I have a boyfriend but honestly I feel so indifferent sometimes because of how shallow he thinks my issues are when I try to seek comfort in him. Which always somehow resulted in him crying and me comforting him. The cycle continues...what should I do to get over all of these thoughts..."	depression_help
Adding Tow Option to Existing Y Order	I have an existing Model Y order that I would like to add the Tow option on. When I tired to do it online they said the base price of the car would go up in addition to the price of the Tow. Has anyone had any luck getting that added without the price going up? Also, has anyone been given a timeline on orders with the Tow option? Lastly, has there been any confirmation that it can be added after delivery? Thanks everyone.	TeslaLounge

A tribute to a Syrian Christian who defended his people from attacks from all around. Let us pray for Christians in the Middle East	"In 2012 Syrian Defense Minister and Colonel General Dawoud Rajiha was killed by the western-backed ""rebels"" intent on destroying Syria's pluralistic nature. Dawoud Rajiha, was a member of Syria's Christian minority, and was the head of the entire Syrian military. Syria was one of the few places in the Middle East where Christians could feel safe, but the West did not care about that. The West and the Zionists could not stand an Arab nation being sovereign and putting its own interests first. The West and the Zionists also wanted to push the narrative that all Arab Muslims oppress the Christians of the Middle East, and that Middle Eastern Christians do not want to liberate Palestine. But, this is not true, and the West and the Zionists do not want the West to know about Dawoud Rajiha and how Syria really is. They do not want the West to know that Rajiha commanded a unit of the Syrian Army that defeated the Israeli Army at the Battle of Sultan Yacoub in 1982. Many of the Syrian protestors in 2011 hated Christians, and were chanting, ""Christians to Beruit, Alawites to the grave."" Rajiha was sanctioned by the US and the EU for defending his community from people who wanted them dead or out of the country, Sadly, the West empowered these ""moderate"" rebels, and they killed Rajiha, and as a result of the West empowering these ""moderate"" rebels and creating an environment for ISIS and al-Qaeda to flourish, there has been a genocide and displacement of Christians in Syria. The West and the Zionists want a ""pro-West"" Wahabi/Salafist government taking over Syria, even if it means there are not religious minorities in Syria. Let us pray for Syria's religious minorities, and let us pray for a just peace in the Middle East. Here is article about Rajiha- [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/general-dawoud-rajha-one-of-the-architects-of-the-syrian-crackdown-7966116.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/general-dawoud-rajha-one-of-the-architects-of-the-syrian-crackdown-7966116.html)"	Catholicism

You should always the respect the pronouns of other people	Its simple respect, just respect how others want to be treated as such. You don't have to agree with them even, but you should just always respect everyone. Asking for someone's pronouns should also be more common. People that disrespect pronouns because they don't agree with a gender non conforming person's ideologies is just an asshole. Just treat people nicely. &#x200B; edit: noticed i put a the before respect, but oof im to lazy to remake the entire post because of that.	unpopularopinion
How do you be yourself everywhere you go?	Everyday is a challenge for me because I can only be myself in the company of myself.

I have social anxiety so that plays a big role in it. But I‚Äôm getting drained and tired of feeling like everyday is a survival game. It‚Äôs literally causing my depression to become worse.	Advice
[Tool] If YOU don‚Äôt set your top priorities, SOMEONE ELSE will set them for you. Here‚Äôs HOW to take control.	LPT: If you don‚Äôt select your *own* priorities, then *someone else will*. Be it a boss, a friend, a child, your partner, a pet, a parent, a celebrity, or a religious leader ‚Äî you may love them, but should they be setting your priorities? No, that‚Äôs your decision to make. Start by **making a list of your top 10 PRIORITIES**. Making the list is the MOST IMPORTANT aspect of taking control. Once you‚Äôve made the list, use it as your tool to guide your activities. **Post the list** somewhere where it will be available for regular review. Then, **list your current ACTIVITIES** in which you participate: Do your *activities* match your *priorities*? **Cut out activities** that don‚Äôt match your priorities. Learn to say no. Then, **decide on new activities** that match your priorities, write them down, and figure out a way to fit them into your life. You can use the **ten-minute method**: if you find yourself with 10 extra minutes, refer to your priorities list and use those 10 minutes to participate in an activity that furthers one or more priority. **You CAN take control of your life!**	GetMotivated

20[f4M] Poland - I had an Internship at a german Company...	... far from home, so I could do some things I would've never done at home. Unfortunately it was cut short by Corona, and I'll probably not be able to go back once it's finished. That's why I'm here, to talk about my time in Germany, what I enjoyed, and what I didn't enjoy so much. As such, you can talk to me either in polish or german, I'm fluent in both, as well as english. And to make sure that I know that I'm in the right subreddit: [this was one of the outfits I actually wore to work](https://i.imgur.com/5BqBxFg.jpg). Ask me whatever you'd like!	dirtyr4r
I almost became emotionally attached to a Transsexual escort	"I was perusing the internet for TS girls like any other weekend and stumbled upon a girl I've never seen before. She was asian, very feminine looking in her pictures (almost too good to be true kind of thing). I sent her a text and told her I wanted to schedule something. She replied very quickly and asked for my race and pic, which I provided. She said I was cute and agreed to schedule with me. I was a bit skeptical if she would actually look like her pics. I went to her place later that night, buzzed up to her apartment, she slowly opened the door and there she was. Looked better in person than her pics, she was wearing lacy lingerie just like in her pics, very feminine body and cute face. She was also very nice, asked me how I was, offered me water, etc. After some small chit chat, she walked me over to the bed and we began making out. She took things very slowly which I really liked, lots of foreplay before she fucked me. As she slid it in for the first time, I grabbed the bottle of poppers I brought and asked if she wanted any (more on this later). She declined and told me it makes her head hurt. I took two big huffs and she began to slowly fuck me. As I lost control over my body, I just stared at her beautiful face as she fucked me harder and harder. After a few minutes when the poppers began to wear off, I asked her if she could cum in my mouth, which she said yes to. She fucked me some more and then said she was about to cum, she pulled out, took the condom off and jammed her medium sized cock down my throat and moaned. I felt the warm cum hit my throat, I didn't let it go down and instead left it in my mouth so I could taste it (kinda just tasted like lube and condoms). Sucked her off for a little bit and swallowed. She then 69'd me and jerked me off while I ate her ass out. Afterwards, I asked her if she was visiting cause I never saw her ad before. She said she was visiting from Thailand and would be here for another couple weeks and then going home. I told her I wanted to see her again before she left and that I'll keep in touch. I didn't know if I was imagining it or what, but I felt some sort of connection with her, I had a feeling she was into me. Ended up meeting her for a 2nd time the following week, pretty much the same experience as the above. The night before she left for Thailand, I texted her again. I asked if she wanted to see me, this time at my place, strictly for fun. I knew this was a long shot because she was visiting strictly to make money. To my surprise, she said she would love to. Later that night, she came over, we shared a bottle of wine and had a very intimate night. Made out longer than usual, we were both buzzed, foreplay under the covers, getting sweaty, etc. Before she started to fuck me, I grabbed my poppers like I usually did, and this time she told me she wanted some. At this point, I knew she had feelings for me because she told me she does not take poppers with clients, so now we are really having NSA fun. We both took a hit, and she fucked me. It was amazing. After we both finished, she told me regretted coming over because she was afraid to catch feelings. I told her it's ok, that we will remain friends and hopefully see each other later. She looked into my eyes with a sad look on her face, seemed like she was waiting for me to propose to her or something. She then cleaned up and we said goodbye and she left. I texted her the next morning telling her to have a safe flight and that I'll miss her, which she reciprocated. Fast forward a year or so later, I see her pics again online and find out shes visiting again. I immediately text her and asked if she remembered me. She did, but her responses were not as ""Friendly"" as before, seemed strictly business. I asked if she wanted to come over, which she said she did but would not be NSA. I agreed anyways, but I went to her place instead. We caught up a bit and then got down to business. It was like our other non-nsa sessions, a bit more kinky as I was not shy this time to ask her for certain fetishes I have (I sucked on her toes, asked her to spit in my mouth, etc). Afterwards, she began texting me very friendly again, asking me how my night was, what I'm doing, etc. We met a couple more times, non-NSA only, and she told me she was going back to Thailand again. This second go-around I felt less and less emotionally attached to her, I think we were both trying to emotionally distance ourselves so we didn't feel sad like the first time. Which I am fine with and is probably the best decision. I texted her one last time before her flight and she responded. I haven't seen her ads in my area since then (6 months ago ish), but if I do, I will definitely reach out to her again."	tsgonewildstories

I Calculated How Much Steve Wrote For Each Album	A while back I did the who wrote what series, and using that info, plus adding up all the seconds of all the parts he helped write I gathered these results: Nursery Cryme: 6:12 (15.7%) Foxtrot: 7:16 (14.2%) SEBTP: 11:00 (20.4%) The Lamb: 12:00 (12.7%) there‚Äôs a big margin of error for this one ATOTT: 7:25 (14.5%) WAW: 9:42 (19.1%) Kinda strange he didn‚Äôt think he got enough on WAW, especially since he has the lead credit on three songs, plus the middle of 11th Earl of Mar. Although when you consider that One For The Vine already exceeds the length of everything Steve wrote, it‚Äôs kinda understandable.	Genesis

Are evictions a thing yet?	I remembered reading that the evictions moratorium expired at the end of April and I did some digging through old news articles which confirmed that the evictions moratorium ended April 26th. Does anyone know if that got extended? Are evictions only being held up by the fact that courts are closed right now? I think the CARES act bans evictions on certain properties through June (estimated to effect about 25% of renters who have federally backed rental agreements or whose landlords used certain federal programs).	rva

Proposal of Additional Metrics	This post is meant to reach the data visualization teams that support Hex. I think it would be helpful to have a time series chart of open stakes. For example, I would like to know how many open stakes exist at 4:00PM ET each day. If we can take that time series and multiply it by the Hex price at 4:00PM each day, then we could see the USD value of all open stakes on a time series basis. Finally, it would also be helpful to see a time series graph with the number of unique addresses with open stakes as of 4:00PM ET, each day. These time series graph that I have proposed mimic some of the key metrics that are used in the insurance industry, such as policies in force and premium in force. Thanks.	HEXcrypto

Got promoted to customer today	I was going to leave early since I wasn‚Äôt feeling good (nauseous, dizzy, sweating) and was working in the meat department and I didn‚Äôt want to be around food and pose a risk to anyone. HR took the opportunity to tell me they were going to end my temporary work with them. I was just kinda in shock as I handed over my badge and vest. No warning or anything. Just ended it right there, which I can understand I guess. But their reasoning was that ‚Äúwe just don‚Äôt need that many people working right now‚Äù yet constantly understaffed and the Walmart‚Äôs in my area are supposedly going on a hiring spree. I was always given the short end of the stick since I was the newbie, and my supervisor was always so passive aggressive to me and HR never communicated with me over important matters. I always felt disrespected and under-appreciated. I went to my car and cried. Now I know that I could only do so much. I tried my very best and always worked hard and got my shit done. Not sorry that I care about my health and my coworker‚Äôs health. While I was sad at first and blamed it on myself, I‚Äôm actually kinda glad that I don‚Äôt work here anymore.

I was naked but covered my upper body with a blanket letting my lower half remain exposed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre smooth now‚Äù he reacted. I simply smiled at him and said ‚Äúwell, I figured if this is gonna be happening a lot, I may as well.‚Äù He asked,‚Äùhow often do you want it?‚Äù I said, ‚Äúanytime I ask for it. Do you agree?‚Äù He said ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù He dipped his finger inside me, tasted me. He leaned toward my face to try for a kiss, I stopped him and pushed his head down between my legs. He played with my freshly shaven, puffy outer lips. The new sensations were amazing (I had never shaved before). He kissed and teased and licked and sucked on me for a good 10 minutes before I was finished, with a few orgasms and very wet sheets. Still in my haze, I said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. He reached up and copped a feel of my breasts then returned to his room. Of course, I still laid there wondering why he hasn‚Äôt tried to fuck me yet. Maybe next time?	SluttyConfessions

Commercial Landlord Refusing to Heat Office	Hi, I'm in England I'm writing this on my parent's behalf. They own and run a domiciliary care company and as a result are very much still working through the lockdown. The place they rent as their office is a really big building with about 65 units. Since lockdown has started the landlord has ceased all cleaning, rubbish collection and heating the building. The biggest problem is the heating as the office is getting really cold we think it's below the 16 degrees minimum that I've read is the legal minimum for a workplace. When the landlord has been asked to turn the heating back on they say it would be too expensive to heat the entire building for just one unit, but we are still paying full rent and, as far as we know, all other tenants are too. Their tenant agreement states that the landlord will provide 'background heat' which they are not doing. They suggested we plug in electric heaters but this has made little difference as the unit is too big. Where do we stand? Is there any way we can get them to heat the building? I've not been able to find any regulations for commercial landlords online. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	LegalAdviceUK
36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar.

Analyzing the clone inhibitor chips	"In TCW S7E11, [the scan](https://imgur.com/50dMgxw) of Rex's brain shows that the clones' inhibitor chips are implanted in the right frontal lobe. This is a very logical place for a device that can suppress individuality and cause violent outbursts. * The right hemisphere of the human brain is responsible for creative thinking, decision making, impulse and motor control. This fits the inhibitor chips' role in suppressing the clones' free will, making them less impulsive, and forcing them to execute Order 66. * Within the right hemisphere, the [right frontal lobe](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/frontal-lobe) controls problem solving, judgment, and personality. It makes sense for the inhibitor chip to be placed here, as it needs to force a clone to abandon individuality, conform to Order 66, and view all Jedi allies as enemies. * Damage to the right frontal lobe can cause antisocial behavior, loss of personality, and dementia. When Tup's inhibitor malfunctions, he ""snaps,"" kills General Tiplar, and lashes out at General Tiplee. Though we know these are the effects of Sidious' brainwashing, his chip's malfunction also likely caused brain damage associated with antisocial behavior. * We also see Order 66 wipe most of the clones' individual personalities. Loyal friends of the Jedi turn on them in seconds; even Rex succumbs, despite trying to fight his indoctrination. If there's a region of the brain to tweak to make this possible, it's the right frontal lobe. * Another note about Rex: when Sidious triggers Order 66, Rex loses control of his left hand muscles and drops his helmet without realizing. If the inhibitor had anything to do with it, then this is medically accurate, since the [right frontal lobe controls muscles in the left side of the body](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318139). Of course, he was also overwhelmed by conflicting loyalties to both Sidious and Ahsoka at the time. * A study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry ([Benson, Cummings, Darby, and Miller, 1997](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=blumer+and+benson+1975&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D850Q_wJYFacJ)) found that patients with frontal-temporal damage were predisposed to committing assault, manslaughter, and other harmful or unlawful behaviors, the exact kind the chips are supposed to inhibit. * Also, at least one patient in that study was arrested for indecent exposure.

Urban Planning YouTube channel	Hi! I am a first year urban planning student in the UK and really want to make a youtube channel that focuses on planning issues both in the UK and globally. Would anyone watch this? And if so, do you have any ideas that could be good for videos? My knowledge isn't amazing atm because I'm still only young but it could be a great way for me to learn new things and pass them on to others! Thoughts?	urbanplanning

New Legendary Hunter Idea	"My friend mentioned to me how the Bald Knobbers where a gang active in Missouri post civil war. Their look and mask is very distinctive and would fit in to Hunt: Showdown very well. Some quotes from the Wikipedia post: The **Bald Knobbers** were a group of vigilantes in the Ozark region of southwest Missouri from 1883 to 1889. They began as a group dedicated to protecting life and property, aiding law enforcement officials in the apprehension of criminals, opposing corruption in local government, and punishing those who violated the social and religious mores of their community. In some places, the vigilantes gained much political influence, occupied key offices, and became effectively the ruling faction in local politics. They made many enemies, however, with whom they had several violent, sometimes fatal, confrontations. In 1886, after gaining national notoriety from their exploits, and embarrassing state leaders, Missouri Governor John S. Marmaduke sent Adjutant General J.C. Jamison to Forsyth to investigate the situation. Upon arrival, although the representative was pleased to see the atmosphere of order that prevailed, he recommended to Kinney that an official dissolution of the Bald Knobbers would be in the best interest of the county. That next day a formal dissolution ceremony was held in the town square where the Bald Knobbers were publicly disbanded, having served their original purpose. It would make sense for the gang members that ""Lost"" their purpose in Missouri to decide to move to Louisiana and start hunting depraved evil monsters in an effort to restore order. They already have the violent tendencies of the other gangs of hunters in the game. With the perverse idea of restoring order to a lawless area. https://preview.redd.it/1jo3hfx275y41.jpg?width=575&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a35c4aaae9c0e98456ad213c5168ae81c940ab7"	HuntShowdown

idea for new druid subclass	so I had idea for a new druid subclass: circle of the swarm. it's a bug themed subclass where you pick a type of swarm from the list and gain specific perks. honeybee: create and enchant honey to give buffs and heal your party. mosquito: poison and annoy opponents while buffing yourself with their blood spider: build webs to hinder opponent movement and get to climb up walls ant: being able to swarm opponents with different ant types that have different effects dung beetle: create balls of dung that gives disadvantage on opponents this subclass is still being created and I'm looking for help on creating it. edit: I'm thinking of letting the druid turn into a swarm as a wild shape	DnD

Pure Madra path benefits	I was thinking about different paths and it got me thinking that so far we haven't see that many benefits of a pure madra path or any particular reason Eithan would choose one. Benefits: * Easy on the channels allowing a lot of madra to be put into techniques * Has a soothing effect on Lindons channels after blackflame * Powerful for nullifying striker techniques Drawbacks: * No ruler technique/weak to ruler techniques * Doesn't have the best enforcer techniques (although Eithan says this Lindons seems pretty good) * Doesn't have much in the way of attacks (Either shatter their core with a striker technique or disrupt them a bit, no inbetween) * No defensive capabilities apart from striker attacks From Uncrowned it seems that the Aurelius clan specialises in storm and lightning based paths matched with their extraordinary sight; Eithan who gives the impression of being a long lost scion from the Aurelius main line seems to be on a weaker path. Obviously most of Lindon's focus has been on blackflame but he would be a shadow of the sacred artist he is if he only had a pure path. While Eithan is a very powerful underlord that seems to be down to his iron body, large core and excellent command over bloodline powers rather than his path at all, arguably he would be a lot more successful with a different path. So it got me thinking that pure madra might be more of a 'late game build' while BlackFlames are a deadly threat at copper maybe Pure madra paths don't start seeing their benefits until Archlord+. The counterpoint being that none of the higher advancements seem too fussed about his path or future advancement. Could be because I'm blatantly wrong or maybe there hasn't been a pure madra sage/herald so people aren't aware.	Iteration110Cradle

Each day that passes I care a little less and one day soon I won‚Äôt even think of you at all. You‚Äôre always so arrogant about your ability to make me fall back in love with you whenever you want.

Rogue Anthropologist	Hey r/3d6!

It'd be great if Blizzard came out and said Allied Races would also be getting new customization options in a patch. Frankly, some of them feel half-finished and need some love and additional options for skin, hair, etc.	For example: * Void Elves desperately need a few less-corrupted options for their skin tones and hairstyles. I'm guessing they could easily borrow some of the new Blood Elf faces coming in 9.0 as well. They'd look awesome with some makeup options s well, like eye shadow around the eyes. * Lightforged Draenei basically look like white ghosts. Their few skin tones and hair colours are so pale and there's very little variety. There might be some symbolism going on there with how the Light washes over everything in the cosmos and makes it all uniform. But they could really use a few options, even if it just comes down to some hair styles and maybe the new rumoured Draenei tails. * Nightborne are still subpar to their NPC counterparts when it should be the other way around if anything. A few Allied Races are really good, like Dark Iron Dwarves. But a lot of them need serious work.	wow
Test This Claim: Outside of the Extremes, Most of Us Write OCs	To contextualise this: my stance is that I do not read fanfic for OCs. I do read OC-centric fics and enjoy them, but this is typically when they explore some theme or aspect of canon I find engaging, or are used to illuminate different aspects of canon characters. Nevertheless, I advance this following set of claims not as something I am deeply convinced about, but as something I have thought somewhat about, and would appreciate hearing more about from others: >\[CLAIM\] Barring extreme cases, most of us, to some degree or other, write OCs. > >\[COROLLARY #1\] A number of us are simply more concerned about marketing our fics as being canon-centric, in one way or another, and not advertising the fact OCs are there. > >\[COROLLARY #2\] There is, perhaps, a fandom or generational divide in terms of advertising OCs in one's fic, which can be chalked down to general attitudes towards OCs. What are OCs? I want to rule out borderline cases, e.g. Random Smuggler in Mos Eisley who gets named exactly twice as a one-line entry in the credits and in the encyclopedia. I do think expanding on these characters is fairly close to creating your OCs, but let's be as strict as possible: an OC is any character that did not exist in any form in canon, whether major or minor. Barring people who truly use nothing more than the canon set of characters, most of us have written at least one fic: minimally, with our equivalent of Random Smuggler in Mos Eisley Who Gets Named In The Credits and Fills The Background, and maximally, as a full-fledged major OC participating in the plot. I'm more confident of the former, weaker claim, of course. But sometimes, we need the OC as a framing device, presenting us the outsider perspective, for instance, or to progress the plot, filling a role that a canon character cannot. If \[CLAIM\] is true, then I think \[COROLLARY #1\] is as well: simply because not all of the fics that meet the conditions of \[CLAIM\] tag themselves as including OCs. Most Academy fics in the Bleach fandom are this way; as are a number of young Anakin fics in Star Wars. \[COROLLARY #2\] I advance as one potential hypothesis to explain \[COROLLARY #1\]: or rather, to explain the difference between fics that do tag for OCs, and those which don't. Other variables which might make a difference - the relative freedom of character tagging on AO3 as compared to FFN, as well as authors conscious of how they want to advertise their fics, and potentially, even authors who don't actually consciously perceive themselves as writing a fic with OCs, and therefore do not tag that way. I find the last possibility the most interesting because it suggests that even this strict definition of OC is unhelpful. We mean something else - or at least, some of fandom means something else by the term 'OC fic.' I'm then interested in whether they mean the same things as the rest of fandom, with the difference in use and attitude coming from value judgements, or whether the disagreement is in part because no one means the same thing at all. Thoughts? (I blame lockdown fwiw.)	FanFiction

Also I'm 31 and female, would I struggle to get a job in such a male dominated career? My dad is an engineer, and also knows a lot about cars and I enjoy learning from him and going to vintage car shows and factories.	MechanicAdvice

Mike Lindell, My Pillow = scumbag	I knew the guy was crazy since he's friends with Trump but I just saw the most ridiculous add. He starts talking about his memoir and how he uses math to prove God is real. He goes on to talk about how coincidences just have to be the work of God and that he thinks his book will give people hope during the pandemic. It's so scummy to use the pandemic to sell merch but I shouldn't be surprised. The weirdest part was he didn't even provide any info on how to buy the book its like he just came on to say hey I wrote a book, God is great, goodbye.	atheism

[HELP] Mixing Two Different Dog Foods	"Hello! My partner and I just got an adorable Pekingese/Pomeranian dog. We have only had him for about 4 days as of today and for the past couple of days have been struggling to get him to eat small kibble. At first he ate the dry kibble mixed with the wet food. We thought, ""oh good he is eating the dry food too!"" The next day we went out and bought an additional bag of that food to have on hand. Low and behold the rest of the day and the next he did not want to eat any of the dry kibble and when we mixed the dry and wet he only ate the wet portion. We were concerned so we went and bought a small bag of another dog food which he seems to enjoy so far. This brings us to today where he ate the dry kibble just fine, but not even two hours later he threw it all up. Of course this concerns us so I have a few questions: do we feed him again after he threw up? If it's the fact that we switched dog foods so quickly is it okay to mix the old wet food with the new dry food? After we make the change to this new kibble is it okay to still give him the wet dog food on occasion? For reference: old dry dog food was Science Diet, wet dog food is Science Diet, new dry dog food is Raw Instinct."	dogs

New Rule- No snarking on abuse victims!	"Hi hi! Sorry I've been a bit out of office for a minute- I've been ill and taking some time away from my computer. I've added a new rule as its come to my attention that there's been some troublesome posts that have made some users uncomfortable- and that's not what we're about here. I'm a bit bummed this needs to be spelled out, but here is the new rule: **No Snarking On Abuse Victims** > The essence of a ""trad fem"" is a woman who posts sexist, racist, and nationalist garbage of her own volition. > Posts of ""trad fems"" in obvious abusive situations, or those in which they may not be acting or speaking out of their own volition will be removed. This can be a tricky distinction, so please use your best judgement. Reported posts will be reviewed and removed if necessary. This rule is a work in progress, so let me know if you want me to add or remove anything. I think this rule should be pretty self explanatory, but I'm always open to suggestions :) Also if you think it's chill to snark on women being abused, you can leave. Go to a different snark community please."	Tradfemsnark

How do I stop being clingy during quarantine	So hopefully I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing this but it has recently dawned upon me how needy and clingy I have become during quarantine. I realised this when my sister pointed out how I was checking my phone like every 5-10 minutes (I was checking for replies back to texts) and it sucks cause I‚Äôm not always like this but now I‚Äôm forced inside and can‚Äôt go out and socialise its kind of driving me nuts how I have no one to talk to I‚Äôve tried learning new skills and done a lot of yard work to keep my mind occupied but it still does not distract me from checking my phone or trying to talk to people . Between having to revise for exams and being locked up in here my neediness starts to show when I‚Äôm texting people back almost instantly when they take hours to get to me (which again isn‚Äôt something I normally do) and it‚Äôs putting people off from talking to me Is there anything else I can do to stop being so needy and stop looking for validation from others when they text me , help	socialskills

Was the Ace of Spades made by Tex Mechanica?	The Tex Mechanica foundry has made a few hand cannons, one of which is the [Silvered Maverick Mk. 41](https://destinypedia.com/Silvered_Maverick_Mk._41), a rare D1 hand cannon. I also suspect the legendary [Red Hand IX](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Hand_IX) (D1), the rare [Azimuth DSU](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Azimuth_DSu), and the uncommon [Mos Ultima II](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Mos_Ultima_II) (D2) to also have been made by them. If you've seen these hand cannons, you can't deny that they share -almost- the same frame as the Ace. This led me to believe that Cayde-6 had it custom-made, as it is mentioned in the Ace of Spades [Grimoire card](https://ishtar-collective.net/cards/ace-of-spades?highlight=ace+of+spades). P.S: for further context, here's this [lore entry.](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/ancient-apocalypse-greaves?highlight=tex+mechanica)	DestinyLore
John says he liked other Paul compositions (November 1973)	"All too often I see trashy articles claiming that the only McCartney number Lennon had any respect for was Here, There and Everywhere. In an interview with Chris Charlesworth (originally published in Melody Maker on 3rd November 1973) to promote Mind Games, Lennon's states; ""I have a favourite of Paul's... Of Paul's I like 'Here, There and Everywhere'... Of course I still like 'Eleanor Rigby', and another was 'For No One.'"" Bet this isn't even the only example. All I want is the truth."	beatles

Im at the highest weight Ive ever been	I hate quarantine	teenagers
She is proud of weight loss	I think she knows what she‚Äôs going for. if she promotes anorexia, then this is her long-standing dream of how to look. She does not want to see changes in her body when she is gaining weight. So she has her own ideal of thinness (thinspiration). The fact that she returned to her appearance as in a Kairi video means that she has not yet achieved her ideal. She wants to be much thinner than she is now. Maybe her family dissuaded her from this, but she ignores them. So when Jaclyn forced her into treatment, her mother reacted so sharply. Because she loves her daughter and does whatever she asks, may she be sick	EUGENIACOONEY
My UFO sighting	I along with 3 friends 1 of whom an active duty Sgt in the Marines at the time, saw a UFO approximately 10 miles north west of Kerns Texas in 1995 around midnight on Dec 26...these friends & I go hunting EVERY year at this SAME spot multiple times every year but this trip during Christmas holidays is special & we all 4 make time to get together an go ...we all grew up together and usually spent several weeks during summer break at my friends family's ranch which is just about a mile east from the land....its a 200 plus acre piece of property in the Trinity river bottoms ...the property is used for cattle grazing & bailing hay with about 50 acres of pasture an another 150 acres of hard woods & brier thickets which is GREAT hunting...it typically has around 40-45 cattle on it at any given time and is owned by 1 of the guys family...as I mentioned we have been there MANY times before and after this 'event' and NEVER seen ANYTHING like what we saw that night....there is 1 stock pond which is right on the edge of the pasture & where the woods & thicket begins....we all met up & got a late start leaving Dallas due to family holiday obligations but we arrived around 11-11:30pm and began setting up camp on the levee of the pond which is where we always camp because its the highest spot on the property and its proximity to the area we hunt \[the woods & thicket leading to the Trinity river. I was trying to start a camp fire and had the headlights of the truck on, pointed at the area where I was building the fire...the fire was hard to get lit because there was a layer of frost on everything but I managed to finally get it lit and was about to turn off the headlights when I started to notice that the light from fire & the headlights was becoming washed out by another light coming from behind me \[it gradually became bright as daytime\] ....I stood up an turned around to see WTF & my 3 friends were standing together staring at this HUGE ball of light \[VERY bright reddish/orange \] rising above the tops of the trees approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile away ....I stepped away from the fire & up to where my friends were standing \[we were looking south\] ...I asked my buddy who is a Marine \[already knowing the answer\] if that was a flare ....he said ''NO FUCKIN WAY''.....it was to bright & WAY to large and wasn't flickering or burning or MOVING like a flare.....it was a LARGE solid round ball of light ....It rose straight up so far \[around 100 feet from the tree tops\] & stopped for maybe 15-20 seconds then began moving east slowly ....after moving approx. 200-300 yards it stopped briefly and changed altitude by dropping at about a 45 degree angle, paused again briefly before an shot off like a bullet at incredible speed...we were NOT drunk \[YET\] nor were ANY of us on any kind of drugs Since then I have researched an found out that there have been MULTIPLE documented reports / sightings of \[unexplained\] lights in the sky around Kerns Tx over the years before and since even sightings of what was described as a fleet of lights ! A few moths later \[after our encounter\] I was there with my friend & his family on the same property helping with mowing and bailing hay \[like EVERY year\] and we found 2 dead cattle both were in pretty bad state of decay \[in Texas heat it doesnt tale long for something like that to go pretty fast\] but you could tell they died around the same time & there was no obvious reason for the deaths,no other cattle were unhealthy or injured ! There was NO sound or heat that I could tell...it was a REALLY cold night so I think if it were putting off any heat that we would have felt it but there was nothing ...the property is FAR from ANY big city light pollution & when there is no moon it is REALLY dark...you can see the stars & even the milky way ....that night in particular was 1 of those kinda nights ...it was clear ...no clouds at all ...it was dark AF...I remember this part distinctly because when we got there my buddies & I had to search around to get wood for the camp fire and we didnt have flashlights so we were just using the headlights from the truck !

It is just as hard for women to get a man's attention as is it for men to get a woman's attention.	"I don't know why men have this idea in their heads, seemingly across the board, that it's easy for women to get attention from men. Not every woman is conventionally attractive, especially by today's standards, and not every woman is extremely extroverted and talkative. It irks me when I see men making this statement because I have always been undesirable in the environment I grew up in, through no choice of my own, and it's really not as easy as ""put yourself out there!"" and ""you're a girl, someone will approach you eventually"" for some of us. Also, men love to say that women can be extremely rude when rejecting a man, which is true and I'm not trying to diminish those experiences. But I have had guys laugh in my face and make cruel jokes behind my back about how I looked and who I was just because I expressed the slightest bit of interest in them. Most men are literally only kind to women that they are attracted to, even on a friendship level! The women I know don't do that. We just don't. Bottom line, everyone - especially people who aren't ""attractive"" or ""talkative"" by today's standards has trouble getting a date, and maybe men shouldn't dish it out if they can't take it."	unpopularopinion

19M - I just lost my best friend (and my only friend). I'm now extremely lonely and depressed. Looking to find new people and make new friends!	"19M here! As the title says, I just lost a friend this morning and I'm completely heart broken. We both met online around 6 months ago, shared numbers and became really good friends! I don't have any other friends, he was my only friend till today and he was my best friend! Today he messaged me saying that he's staying away from social media to focus on his career and he's not gonna be able to talk to me for an entire year until he finishes his studies. I respected his choice, told him that I'll support him always and wished him luck and success and said goodbye. Although I'm really happy for him, I still feel really bad and heartbroken that I lost a friend. My friend meter went from 1Ô∏è‚É£ to 0Ô∏è‚É£. Now I'm lonely and have absolutely nobody to talk to, so I made this new account on reddit in hope of finding new friends! Now I'm not trying to find a replacement (he is irreplaceable), I'm also not here looking for sympathy, I'm just trying to talk to new people and make new friends, and I know you're a great person, so LET'S BE FRIENDS!! About myself : I'm really scared to make new friends, the main reason is that they'll leave me. I've had friends who have engaged me in conversation for an entire day and vanished the next day. I mean, being friends for one day... Is it even a thing? I really don't know, please educate me if it is. Now, the thing is, when I become friends with somebody, I start to really like them (not in a creepy way) and I form a special kind of ""friendship bond"" with them, and if they break that bond all of a sudden and leave me, it's gonna really hurt, so I'm trying to look for a friend who won't ghost me after a day or a week. Now I would really like to be honest with you all, so I'll tell you this beforehand just if that's something you'd want to know about me before being my friend. I'm suffering from depression, so I'm not really an expert in having great conversations. I'm sure I'll be really awkward at first, but I promise to try my best and make my best attempts in having a decent conversation. I might not make you laugh, I might be a little awkward, but I'll be the most loyal person in your life! (Second most loyal if you have a pet in your life already). Once we're friends, I'm always going to be there for you no matter what and I'm never going to leave you! I mean, unless you push me and run away of course (oh yeah, I forgot to mention, I sometimes make bad jokes). So I've said everything about me, now I'm looking to find new people and make new friends! Now I've heard from many people in this subreddit that I would get more friends if I was a girl, but I'm not, so I might get less responses, but I'm still going to try! No matter who you are, from which country you are, male or female, please DM me without thinking twice! Who knows, we might become really great friends! I love you and I want to be friends with you! If you read this till the end (or even if you didn't) -- HAVE A NICE DAY !! YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL PERSON !!"	Needafriend

I (30f) visited a sleazy sex club on my lunch break last summer and had an incredible time	Last summer, I was a cooped up *housewife (committed relationship but I still work) and I was desperate for good cock. I decided to look up glory holes (sorry lol) but it felt dangerous. I saw a couple in reviews for sex shops and visited them but the vibe wasn‚Äôt right. I saw someone mention having a good time at a sex club on the west side of town. I researched it for weeks and everything seemed legit, but they were only open at night. I wanted to do everything in my power to stay safe and going at night wasn‚Äôt happening. I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck one day when I saw their daily special on the upcoming Friday was a Nooner session from 12pm - 5pm! I bought slutty panties and pasties to really get my stripper out. I made up my mind to go and told my boss I had a doctors appointment that Friday that might run long. As I drove over, my heart was pounding. I felt curious about what it would look like and about the bad reviews online, but I knew that only angry people leave reviews typically. I called ahead and asked if it was busy, and she said there were a few couples and single men still there and that it was winding down from earlier. When I saw the building and the small sign on the door, I was nervous and excited. I pulled up and parked with my heart beating through my chest, looking at the ten or so cars. While gathering courage, a guy pulled up next to me and hit his car door on my car lightly when he got out - we smiled and it was kind, and I didn‚Äôt feel judged or creeped out for being there like I thought I would. I rolled down my window to tell him it‚Äôs okay; he was a younger and slender guy with very pretty eyes and a smile. He asked me if I was going inside, and I hesitated. I had been planning on just driving away, but the friendliness and respect of this patron made me feel much more relaxed. I smiled and told him I‚Äôd be in soon after I relaxed. I wondered if that was true. I decided to just do it. I was nervous and confused at first, but the reception area was kind. They waved me in and I was flocked immediately by several men that I chose someone new from; an older guy with incredible salt and pepper hair. Introductions were made and I met Rene officially, a handsome older man who was well dressed worn a thick European accent. we made small talk about me being a first timer. He asked about my job and perked up when I said I was an engineer. He told me about the feeling he got building planes as an aviation engineer and that a plane he designed was taking off today. He asked if I‚Äôd like company - of course, I told him. We sat at the table and chairs for awhile and he told me about traveling to Boise for business, and I told him about San Francisco. We shared traveling woes and laughed. I asked him about the club and whether he came there often, and we discussed the different rooms and what they‚Äôre generally used for. I asked about the rules and etiquette, and he said anyone could take anything off and show as much as they want, gesturing to the naked man playing pool behind us. I told him it was difficult to hear him and get to know him and asked if there was a couch in another room where we could sit closer. He suggested a private room upstairs and told me that they‚Äôre cleaned vigorously and have fresh sheets down every time. I had seen on the reviews that the rooms were cute, so I told him sure - I‚Äôd love that. We were followed upstairs to the rooms by the attendant and a single man, and we walked by rooms that were being cleaned. He told me the room at the end was great; I followed. The door opened to an incredible room with a red light with mirrored walls and ceiling. The single male that followed us asked if we wanted company, and Rene answered no for us and we laughed, shutting the door slightly. He asked where I‚Äôd like to sit, the chairs or the bed, and I opted for the bed. He was a grey fox and smelled like expensive body wash and beard oil when I sat next to him. He rubbed my back and I put my things on the table while the attendant brought a condom, shutting the door after her. After chatting a bit more, I took my vest off and he smiled and said that I should take my shirt off, too. I smiled and sat back down, and he leaned in to kiss me. He tasted extremely fresh and smelled wonderful, so I had high hopes for his hygiene. I smiled and told him I‚Äôd been waiting to show off my pasties to someone and took off my shirt; with no bra, my huge tits bounced out and revealed my new lightning bolt pasties. He loved them and immediately started playing with my tits; I could see my nipples poking out hard under the pasties. After making out and kissing a bit, he removed his shirt and said he was overdressed. He still had his incredibly nice jeans, belt, and chuck Taylor‚Äôs on - so cute! We made out again and I said I was going to take my shorts off to show him something else, standing up and shimmying out of my vintage high waist shorts. I was wearing black lace panties with blue tie-up sides that were crotchless, but he couldn‚Äôt see that part yet. His eyes ate me up and he laid me back on the bed to admire me in the red light before stripping to his cute European boxer briefs. He fondled me and played with me through my panties when he discovered they were crotchless. He slid his boxers off and tossed them down while pushing me up on the bed gently and spreading my legs, still with my undies on. He spread my legs wide and ate me out gently while I watched my tits and my cute pasties in the mirror ceiling. He was incredibly skillful and had me near orgasm several times, which I kept pulling away from to save it. I told him he felt incredible and he pushed both of my legs up, exposing my pussy more and continued to eat. I asked what I could do to thank him and he gently pushed back on my legs to spread me wider and expose my freshly shaven asshole. He licked a couple of times under my pussy to gauge interest and I moaned to him that he felt amazing. His tongue dove down around my asshole and licked me slowly and deeply, gently tongueing my asshole and loosening me up. He worked his tongue inside my hole and grabbed my thick legs to pull my ass around his tongue, sliding it in to extend as far as it would go while keeping a thumb on my clit. After an incredible amount of time, I started bucking my hips and he returned to my pussy, suckling on my clit and pushing a finger in, then a second one. He fingered me deeply and slow at first, then upped the intensity to a deep vigorous finger fuck that had me squirming. I pulled away and laughed and told him he was amazing at that and that I wanted to repay him. He crawled on the bed next to me and showed me his cock, a good 7 inch thick cock that was neatly groomed and smelled like his body wash and fresh laundry. He pulled off my pasties and nibbled and sucked on my nipples gently, murmuring ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck‚Äù as he complimented my big tits and how perky and young they felt. I licked his tip and tasted him, slowly working him with my mouth until I got down to the base when he moaned loud and sent chills through me. I pushed my tongue down and licked hard for a while, working his shaft with my hand and smiling with his cock in my mouth while he watched my exposed ass and pussy through my panties in the mirror. He pulled out and told me to lick, which I did, smiling and giving him long, loving licks up and down his big cock. He groaned and told me how hot I was and kept muttering ‚Äúfuck‚Äù to himself. He gently held my head still and fucked my mouth slowly, then said he wanted to see and laid down on the bed. He spread his legs and I crawled between them smiling, locking his eyes while I started to suck on his tip. I worked him into my throat and let him rub his cock around deep past my gag reflex as he moaned. I slid him out and licked him again with eye contact and his body stared to shake gently. As I pulled my head up, he looked up at me desperately and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget my balls‚Äù and I smiled and dove back in, licking and sucking his balls while giggling at him. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I almost forgot‚Äù I said while he groaned deeply and put his head back. ‚ÄúThis is good stress relief right?‚Äù I asked him teasingly. He agreed, and I sat up on my knees. ‚ÄúI have 30 minutes before I have to get back to work, but I‚Äôm here and yours for the entire time‚Äù I whispered in his ear, making out with him and rubbing his cock. He pouted and whined and said okay, and asked me then to get on my knees and in the doggy position. He spread my ass cheeks wide and ate my pussy while smacking my big ass and grabbing onto my legs to pull me deeper onto his face and tongue. He slid his fingers into me again and moved his tongue to my exposed ass, tongue fucking me while rubbing my g-spot. I moaned and told him he was incredible as he moved his thumb to my asshole. He pushed his thumb against my hole and then inside of it, gripping me with two fingers in my pussy and his thumb deep in my ass. I couldn‚Äôt believe this is how he wanted to spend his 30 minutes, but I was in bliss. He used his other hand to rub my clit and smiled down at my body as I watched him through my hair, face down on the bed. I let him eat his fill and watched his cock get even bigger and thicker in the mirror as he took the hand on my clit and moved it to work his cock. He pulled up and got into position behind me, smacking my ass hard and asking me if I was ready for the condom. I sat up on my knees and said yes please and smiled at him. He shook his head and smiled in disbelief when I told him he was hot, and asked how old I was. When I told him, his eyebrows shot up and he said he was almost 30 years older than me and that i was younger than his daughter. I laughed and wiggled my ass at him, and he slid my panties off. He grabbed the condom and got it ready to roll on, then motioned with his cock to please suck a little more. I grinned and crawled over to him, sucking him slow and steady while he moaned every time he felt my tongue. I pulled back and he put the condom on. I asked where he wanted me and in what position, and he told me he already found his favorite and asked me to offer up to him in doggy style. I spread my legs and he got behind me, rubbing his cock on me and asking me to spread my legs more (I‚Äôm tall), plunging into me and moaning ‚Äúyes, perfect, right there‚Äù as he started fucking me. He slapped my ass hard and I pulled my hair up and held it as I was facedown, watching us in the mirror as he fucked all his stress from work into me and stretched out my pussy. I grabbed the sheets and pushed back into him, letting him grip my hips and fuck me deep while he moaned and told me how hot and perfect I was. I moaned as he grabbed my leg and pushed a finger inside my ass while fucking me, expanding it to two fingers when my moans quickened. He pulled his fingers out and gripped my hips, fucking me faster and faster until he was pounding my pussy open and gaped. I watched him in the mirror as he started arching his back, feeling his fingers dig into my hips and his grip tighten. I giggled and looked at him in the mirror and shook my ass while he fucked me and said ‚Äúgimme‚Äù to him smiling, and he lost it - he screamed and groaned so hard I knew every other room heard it, pounding into me with his face up toward the red light and his eyes closed. He took a total of 10 pumps to finish cumming, pushing into me deep and laughing and smiling with the release. I told him he felt amazing and he was so hot to watch as he bobbed the cum filled condom into me with his cock, softer but still big enough and thick enough to stay in me. He stayed there massaging my pussy with his worn out cock in me for another minute or so, rubbing my ass and back gently and squeezing my shoulders, murmuring to me how beautiful I was and how good I felt. I could tell he didn‚Äôt want to pull out; I spread my legs and rubbed his cock from the inside with a good kegel massage while he rode his bliss and came down softly. He pulled out and grabbed us two fresh towels, smiling and telling me I was crazy to keep saying how hot he was, and that he was hot thirty years ago. I laughed and told him that I had just gotten good proof that he still had it, and he laughed hard - no, still works, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm aiming for! He was incredibly shy and sweet. I got dressed and he asked me about what college was like and said he hoped I had a good time with him - I hugged him and told him it was incredible. He showed me videos of his plane taking off and the dashboards and systems that he had designed on his phone, and we chatted about Russia because it‚Äôs the only place that doesn‚Äôt have an aerial map released for the terrain software - it was fascinating. We grabbed our stuff and he got out a generous tip for the bartender as she also cleans the rooms. We headed downstairs past the other patrons smiling, and I enjoyed the looks and eyes on my big tits bouncing in my shirt without a bra, nipples hard and poking through the fabric without my pasties. We walked outside and I hugged him and he said he really hopes it was enjoyable and that he‚Äôd love to see me again - I hugged him back closely and told him definitely if I‚Äôm there again. I headed back to my car for a much needed break and a truck pulled up next to me as I was about to back up. It was a cute guy with a construction vest on that was checking me out. I rolled down my window and greeted him, feeling bold from the great time I‚Äôd just had. He smiled and asked, a lot of guys for you? And I said just one. we chatted about how it wasn‚Äôt busy anymore and he begged and joked for me to come inside, but I told him I only had 5 minutes before I leave to work. He told me he only goes to jerk off or get hand jobs and smiled at me, asking if I want him to give me something so I could spend my 5 minutes with him. I teased and said he‚Äôs fast, and he said yes very. I said no, because I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was against the rules, and offered to flash him from my car instead. I pulled out my tits and played with them for him as he unzipped his jeans and showed me his huge cock that was visibly pulsing without him working it. I smiled and played with my tits and put on a show for him through the window as he jerked his cock hard for me, letting me watch but being careful to hide from the people walking around by their cars. I jiggled and bounced them around and said I have to go, and he shook my hand and said his name was Alejandro and begged to know when I‚Äôd be back. I smiled and said it looks like Friday is my day :) I drove away wet and satisfied with how well-received and respected I was, and how incredibly attractive I felt. It felt great and was an amazing confidence boost. I have always wanted to be fucked in a mirrored room and love red light - I had a 10/10 time! Happy to answer any questions, one of the happiest days of my life	SluttyConfessions
Pronunciation difference between „Åë„ÅÑ„Åç and „Åë„Åà„Åç?	First of all, I know that ‚Äúkeeki‚Äù should be spelled in Katakana. But, my Japanese skills are only 3 days old, so I am still only on the Hiragana script. I was learning the character ‚Äúke‚Äù („Åë) and stumbled upon two words- business and cake. Is there are difference in pronunciation between the two? Because I can‚Äôt hear it. Or is the only difference that ‚Äúcake‚Äù is spelled in Katakana due to being an imported word?	japanese
Unmatching girls who reply with one sentence responses or ghost me has never felt so good!	So I recently picked up dating again after a 3 year hiatus to focus on myself and my career (went through a rough patch in life) as soon as I came back COVID hit so I got a little unlucky but after 3 years off I really developed a strong mind and ability to not be phased by rejection. Also I've really changed my whole outlook on how I approach women, I have had several matches on Hinge who would reply with one sentence after I tried to get a meaningful conversation going and put alot of effort into each reply (sometimes 1-3 small paragraphs), and I have felt no remorse just straight up unmatching them I feel so free! I used to be all worrisome like this girl doesn't like me or why isn't she responding. Lesson learned it's not worth your time waiting for someone who just doesn't care, keep on going there is for sure someone out there who will put effort into the conversation and will be very genuine, dont let it get you down!	dating

Passed A+ Core 1 (5 minutes ago) Online!	Just passed the Core 1 (1001) and couldn't be happier! :D Scored a total of 775. I have no prior IT experience, but quite tech savvy. Used Prof. Messers videos and Mike Myers books, and would say that Mike Myers saved my ass due to detailed info on configuration. Prof. Messer covers a lot, but not everything that was asked, so I would suggest using more than one type of source material. Tip to everyone taking it at home: 1. Don't drink too much water/coffee prior / Go to the toilet before (I was contemplating pissing myself the last 30 min and I even went right before starting) 2. Don't cover your mouth or read questions out loud (the proctor will tell you so) 3. Flag and skip (I cannot stress this enough, I most likely got two questions correct due to there being correlating information)	CompTIA

Quarantine has been PRODUCTIVE! 4 WORKS ON WATTPAD	For over 20 years I've written works without compiling them into one place.During quarantine I've put my written works together and have now 4 works (2 complete) going on Wattpad with new works being updated DAILY as I still have tons to go through. My writing goal has always been working within my own created Universe. My writing revolves around dark fantasy and neo-noir elements that I have molded into a world that highlights the struggles between the Fallen and Divine. I am also lucky to have the very talented Vanessa Trueba [https://www.instagram.com/nessa\_ninona/](https://www.instagram.com/nessa_ninona/) lending her talents for my Revelations series with chapters from Book III finally being uploaded after a 7 year hiatus.

AOOs through an ally	Simple and quick question: Can I attack enemies that provoke aoo if there's an ally between them and me, if I have enough reach to hit them? I ask this because in the manual, they say that you can't hit them if they have cover: Cover and Attacks of Opportunity You can‚Äôt execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you. However, creatures give SOFT cover to other creatures: Soft Cover Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Stealth check So I need to have [Phalanx Formation](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/phalanx-formation-combat/) to attack them with an aoo?

The Pain of being a Hammer Main (Poem+partial serious discussion topic)	Oh hammer, you sweet pain Why have I ever made you my main &#x200B; Every strike and every swing Massive damage you will bring &#x200B; I rumble and tumble And aim for the face Then watch every monster crumble Under you sweet embrace &#x200B; But how I suffer so For every other weapon I try It just feels too slow &#x200B; No other weapon does damage like you do Tried the sword and board But the damage didn't follow through &#x200B; Bow, Bowgun, Dual blades Every one of them suffers the same fate For I have yet found A weapon so efficient to equate \--------------------------------------------------------------- &#x200B; Alright, now for something serious. I'm wondering if other people have this problem, mainly hammer (and probably GS) mains. Every other weapon feels slow compared to the hammer and I find it really difficult to get used to new weapons. And Im not meaning slow as in using it, but in dealing damage. I can take down a monster in 20 min in terms of damage where it just takes longer with any other weapon. Lot more dodging etc going on. And this is not too serious, I understand if I practice enough I can do the same damage with all weapons, but the hammer just makes the switch difficult. &#x200B; So the question, do other people have this problem?

New Legendary Hunter Idea	"My friend mentioned to me how the Bald Knobbers where a gang active in Missouri post civil war. Their look and mask is very distinctive and would fit in to Hunt: Showdown very well. Some quotes from the Wikipedia post: The **Bald Knobbers** were a group of vigilantes in the Ozark region of southwest Missouri from 1883 to 1889. They began as a group dedicated to protecting life and property, aiding law enforcement officials in the apprehension of criminals, opposing corruption in local government, and punishing those who violated the social and religious mores of their community. In some places, the vigilantes gained much political influence, occupied key offices, and became effectively the ruling faction in local politics. They made many enemies, however, with whom they had several violent, sometimes fatal, confrontations. In 1886, after gaining national notoriety from their exploits, and embarrassing state leaders, Missouri Governor John S. Marmaduke sent Adjutant General J.C. Jamison to Forsyth to investigate the situation. Upon arrival, although the representative was pleased to see the atmosphere of order that prevailed, he recommended to Kinney that an official dissolution of the Bald Knobbers would be in the best interest of the county. That next day a formal dissolution ceremony was held in the town square where the Bald Knobbers were publicly disbanded, having served their original purpose. It would make sense for the gang members that ""Lost"" their purpose in Missouri to decide to move to Louisiana and start hunting depraved evil monsters in an effort to restore order. They already have the violent tendencies of the other gangs of hunters in the game. With the perverse idea of restoring order to a lawless area. https://preview.redd.it/1jo3hfx275y41.jpg?width=575&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a35c4aaae9c0e98456ad213c5168ae81c940ab7"	HuntShowdown

Emergent Gameplay concept: Hunt PC pirates	"In other free-form MMOs with open PVP I have often been a pirate or a ganker. But, honestly I had a shower thought. The nature of the FSD interface allows you to perceive other player interactions from a distance without being noticed. The hunt and ""good karma"" from saving people from pirates, i.e. gank the pirate would be a good serotonin boost, and interesting ""end game"" content. Play Space Cop. But I've never been ganked in Elite. I hear about it have done it, but never been victim. How common is it? And where could I go to help save some new pilot from certain doom? But I also see flaws here, Elite is BIG. Most miners play in solo. And I haven't ever even been harassed so how common is pirating, really? I've read about it quite a lot though, so it must exist, ya?"	EliteDangerous
Day 1 solo has been a success! (So far)	My husband went back to work today. 6.5 weeks with us all home, isolating together, and getting to know little man. The last few days have been a nightmare, not sure if it was a growth spurt or a leap or whatever but my calm little guy has been nothing but fussy. That coupled with the stress of hubs going back to work as the province reopens from the Pandemic, as We live in the second hardest hit province in Canada, so not exactly super excited as he works in people's homes for a living. I really wanted him to not go. I was dreading today, how was I going to do it alone? How are we going to stay healthy with him going back to work? But so far so good. Had a quiet morning of giggles and smiles, even managed to get the dog walked, followed by little man putting himself down for a nap. Hubs called to fill me in on the health and safety measures his boss has provided and sounds like he's gone over board which is fine by me. It's not ideal but I definitely feel less anxious than I did. We got this! Being a new parent in a pandemic isn't ideal but we'll get through this! Somehow I am going to keep this kid happy for 8 hours a day, 5-6 days a week and we're all going to stay healthy üòä. Just needed somewhere to share that I'm proud of my family and my new found Mom abilities. And absolute Worst case Ontario my MIL has been isolating like a champ and would happily walk the 20 minutes in the snow to finally meet her Grandbaby to help me out.	NewParents
High rise condo changes effects of milk frother	For 2 years I lived on the 63rd floor of a building and my Nespresso milk frother worked so poorly, with any type of milk. I have now moved to the 20th floor of a building on the same Canadian city and cannot believe how differently the milk frother works! Are there any scientific minds out there that could provide some explanation as to what is going on? Annoyingly, I actually replaced my frother a year ago because I thought it was broken. I eventually thought it was just a bad product!	nespresso

Check out the site for more LoR guides! **First wins of the day** * First 3 wins of the day give 400, 200, 100 EXP **PvP ‚Äî unlimited wins, max 10 losses** * Each win gives 200 EXP, no limit * Losses 1-4 give 100 EXP * Losses 5-10 give 50 EXP * Losses 11+ give 0 EXP **Friend Challenges ‚Äî first 5 wins or losses** * First 5 wins give 200 EXP * First 5 losses give 100 EXP * More than 5+ wins or losses give 0 EXP **AI ‚Äî unlimited wins, first 10 losses** * Wins 1-4 give 100 EXP * Wins 5-10 give 75 EXP * Wins 11+ give 50 EXP * Losses 1-4 give 50 EXP * Losses 5-10 give 25 EXP * Losses 11+ give 0 EXP With this knowledge, here's a checklist of what you might want to accomplish daily to max out on the bonus daily EXP: 1. Try to reroll for 1,500 EXP quests, or quests that favor your decks 2. Trade 5 wins and 5 losses with a Friend while trying to help each other clear daily quests 3. Surrender 10 AI matches 4. Win at least 3 PVP matches 5. Lose or Surrender 10 PVP matches 6. Win 10 AI matches 7. Do Expeditions if available At this point, you can go on and continue playing more PVP matches and each win will give you 200 EXP with no cap. Oh and daily quests take effect on AI or friend matches too even if you surrender. Hope this helps! And would love to hear your thoughts and tips/tricks.	LegendsOfRuneterra

My Theory About What Lies Within Sandy Cheeks Cock	source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SandyCheeksCockVore/comments/gftb13/my\_theory\_about\_what\_lies\_within\_sandy\_cheeks\_cock/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandyCheeksCockVore/comments/gftb13/my_theory_about_what_lies_within_sandy_cheeks_cock/) This question really got me thinking critically about SandyCheeksCockVore. After hours of research I must say I have hit a dead end. It is truly a mystery what lies within the cock of Sandy Cheeks. Think of it as a sort of like a black hole, no one knows what's on the other side. Is the Sandy Cheeks in our universe just a mere doorway into another whole dimension of Sandy Cheeks Cock Vore? We may never know. All we know is that Sandy Cheeks is a higher being (likely from another plateau of existence) of unprecedented strength. All of those who attempted to enter the vacuum have never returned. The SCP foundation has attempted to subjugate her to little avail. All we can do is worship Sandy Cheeks, and her massive cock. Hopefully we'll get answers one day...	copypasta
Summaries in studying are useless	I see so many, in fact everyone making little ‚Äúsummary notes‚Äù of whatever they are studying in uni as a way of studying the material. My question is, why? Unless you‚Äôre a crammer who doesn‚Äôt care about learning but only purpose of learning is to pass grades, then yea fair enough but I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre at uni because you care about what you learn ? Otherwise why would u be paying to go to uni in the first place right ? So if you care so much about learning, instead of memorising then why don‚Äôt you just learn the entire content and understand it? That way, you don‚Äôt have to memorise anything ; it‚Äôs just recalling from what‚Äôs part of your knowledge now	unpopularopinion

ELI5: How does cosmic inflation increase distances and not just the size of objects?	I don't understand why cosmic inflation results in increasing distances between celestial bodies. If it's a phenomenon that affects all space, because *space itself* is being blown up, shouldn't it also mean that for example the distance between the atoms that make up our bodies, and our telescopes, and the entire earth, would increase too? And if everything gets inflated equally, why would we even notice a difference? Like, if I zoom in on a picture, the *relative* distances between objects doesn't change because everything is magnified equally. But cosmic inflation is explained as *just* the distances increasing while the objects themselves remain unaffected, apparently? Like, where is the limit drawn? Does the distance between earth and moon increase? Earth and sun? Our solar system to others?	explainlikeimfive
Weird thing about New Normal	I think a lot of us already know that you can find a bunch of different characters or things in the background of New Normal that have been in his previous videos, for example at the end of the music video you can find a man sitting on a chair, this is almost the exact same person/thing sitting on a chair in the song whisper also by jack stauber. My question is, why did he do this. There must be a reason behind it because i doubt he would do this for no reason. From what i know he has never done this before. Let me know what you guys think.	jackstauber

18 [F4M] be my (boy) friend? incoming freshie LF long-term college friend	So I came across this sub and was curious so I wanted to give it a try. Wala ako sa pinas rn but I will be once everything‚Äôs settled for college, which I‚Äôm anxious abt cos everything will be new to me, so it‚Äôs comforting to at least have someone na kaclose ko once I enter college life in an unfamiliar environment. Also, I‚Äôm pretty introverted kaya mejj nahihirapan ako makipagkaibigan, esp with guys. Plus, I‚Äôve been feeling kinda down lately, could use some good company :) Looking for someone new to talk to, wholesome lang cos I‚Äôm here for a legit relationship na long-term (hopefully). By relationship, I mean friends lang, but if we hit it off, maybe smth more? We‚Äôll see how things go. Me: - maputi with glasses, between 5‚Äô0‚Äù to 5‚Äô1‚Äù - cute ?? HAHA see for urself nalang - i‚Äôll be residing in QC pag nasa pinas na ako - mahiyain at first pero once i open up more, im the complete opposite + if kavibes kita, convos will flow easily - writing is my passion, mahilig magbasa, into filmmaking - watches all kinds of shit: films, netflix shows, youtube, docus, kdramas, just started getting into anime - love learning about history, mythology, arts, philosophy, etc. - music taste is generally rnb mixed with a bit of rap/hip-hop, i also listen to a few local artists - nagrereply agad, as much as i can ofc :) You - 18-20, maybe even 21? (incoming freshie or uni student lng) - single, open-minded, cute lowkey lol (but pls don‚Äôt get me wrong, ur personality/vibe matters the most to me) - nasa metro manila area - good sense of humor; fine with dark humor and dirty humor, u the type who enjoys memes and vines? even better - good conversationalist - can be my college buddy - can tolerate the time difference (5 hrs behind ph time) - not dds or marcos apologist pls - bonus pts nalang kung same music taste naten SHET sorry ang haba lmao, just wanna make sure I gave a proper intro abt me and what I‚Äôm looking for. Pero kahit nde same interests naten, I‚Äôm still willing to talk, that‚Äôs up to u ofc.

What exact points should I mention in what exact order when coming out as trans to my parents (face to face)?	"I plan on coming out to my parents as soon as I graduate school, write my exams and we all move to the capital of our country (we just want to live a better quality life). As soon as we rent or buy a new apartment or house in the new city, I want to come out as FtM to my parents. I want to tell them that I won't mind that much if they won't be able to see me as a son or get used to my new name and pronouns and other things, but I need my new future friends in Germany to know that I'm a trans man and that I want to change as much info about my gender in my documents as I'm able to so I can finally peacefully live the rest of my life as the gender I am, among other things. I just want to know how exactly I should say or script this whole thing. What other things do I need to mention like ""I trust you enough to tell you this"", ""I hope you'll respect my decision (to physically and socially transition, not to be a different gender obviously lol) among other things, in what way and what order should I say and mention these things? I'm sorry if what I'm saying doesn't make much sense. I want to give them a blunt and understandable speech about me being trans, how I feel about it and what I want to do about it, but I'm notorious for stumbling over my words, stuttering, using parasite words, and ESPECIALLY for constantly getting off track, repeating myself and having multiple very long brain farts. Basically, I'm not that good of a verbal talker, and it doesn't help that quarantine is further hindering my chances of verbally communicating with others (like in school). I want to add something else in this post but as I'm typing everything my brain is almost completely shut down and I'm not able to think clearly and I'm just kinda spewing sh_t right now so please forgive me lol."	asktransgender

Elfen Lied is honestly a great psychological horror, even if it's full of gore.	The first episode has got to be the most gory and brutal first episode of any anime I have seen. But after that, it gets better. The characters progress through the series as unaware of the brutality of the girl they are keeping safe, as well as showing the dark side of humans and split personality. The OST is also beautiful and fitting, and the ending is good. Also, there's an absolutely horrifying scene in this anime which literally had me scarred, if you like horror.	Animesuggest

US Poker Trip - Need tips on cities and rooms!	Hello Poker Friends, I am an avid and regular poker player - live and online. I live in Kansas City and the poker scene here is great! I know a few groups of players who host home games and the casinos have great action too. Harrah's and Hollywood are where it is at for the juicy games. Ameristar isn't too bad but overall not as hot as the other two. &#x200B; I try and play poker on every trip or vacation I go on. Sometimes just one session unless I base the whole trip around poker like I do when I went to Las Vegas twice. &#x200B; Cities I have played in: Many rooms on the Las Vegas strip, all the major ones Daytona Beach Poker Kennel Club Seattle Fortune Poker Omaha Horsehoe Downstream OK &#x200B; So overall it has only been a handful of cities but I want to expand that. I went to Vegas twice last year and was so excited to go again in April until it was shutdown. Too bad. But now I am more pumped than ever to go and I cannot wait. I have a lot of fyler points and can do at least 3 more trips. I want to go to Las Vegas once more of course but I really want to try to do a trip where I visit a city for just two nights and visit 2-3 poker rooms during my time in the city. Can you guys suggest good poker rooms in your cities to play in? Maybe we can have a meet up! Here are the cities I am thinking. &#x200B; Chicago Houston Tampa Bay / Orlando Somewhere on the East Coast Los Angeles Maybe Seattle again &#x200B; What do you guys have in mind?	poker

Why Odyssey is good and Valhalla may be bad	Yeah, the title is bait but it's a fair discussion, so please read it till the end. First of all, Odyssey is good, not perferct. I understand some of criticism, and agree with the most of them. But what I don't agree is with the overwhelming size of the map been a bad thing. The map and the design of places and cities of classical greece during the peloponnesian war is unprecedented and beatiful. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't recall seing other recreation so well made of that time. Sure it has historical inacurracies, but it's one of the best, if not the best, way to feeling how life was at that time. Said that, AC games changed, and to me since AC III the modern time lore lost it's meaning... Ubi is trying bring Layla as Desmond, but I don't see a good work on that. To the old AC fans like me, RPG is the way they find to keep the game fresh every 2 years, and the old aspects and gameplay are gonne. &#x200B; So, what expected about Valhalla? Besides the importance of the historical period, compared to Odyssey, Valhalla will suffer of that impact, living in a golden mythologic greece, to the cloudy northerm England. I'm preety sure the visual of the game will be outstanding, but explore Old Egypt or Greece feels more appealing. Other point to consider, myths. Yes, we all know about a lot of myths from vikings and celtic culture, most of RPG drink of this foutain, but as we approach the modern times the explanation to why we encouter myths in the free world become less plausible. Can be a glitch (Origins) or a simulation inside a simulation (Odyssey). Finally, to be clear I'm not trashing a yet to release game. I'm just been realistc on an analysis to what is about to come. To be honest I'm hoping the settlement aspect they are talking about compasate for the lacking of other things. My concern is that settlement aspect is something similar to The Division 2, to simple for an AC game.	assassinscreed
Can drones perform offline?	Rigger wants to tell his drone to go offline from the Matrix, perform a given task and then go back online. The goal is to prevent a spider from hacking the drone, while it is in a restricted area. I would rule no, because the rules offer the option of running drones silent, but I couldn't justify why a drone should not be able to run disconnected from the Matrix, when it uses its own programs and the Rigger loses the ability to connect with said drone for the entire time. So, can they do it? If not, what's some fluff/flavor I can use to explain this with?	Shadowrun
Why I'm riding in the road	"Dear asshole who yelled at me, here are many reasons I might be riding in the road. * there is broken glass or other debris in the bike lane, the bike lanes commonly have junk in them you would not want to ride over (or which might be dangerous) * someone has parked in the bike lane or stationed something in the bike lane, trust me when I say that the bike lane is always the first part of the road to be blocked by something or someone (trash cans, rideshare, orange cones, improperly parked vehicles, ...) * there are cars parked reaaaaaal close to the bike lane and I'm worried someone might open their door and send me head over heels. Usually I just keep my eyes peeled but if a car has tinted windows, or it's a truck, or my spidey sense tingles, I may move out of the bike lane * there's a big curb or ditch or hedge or something on the side of the road, I can't ride right next to something where if I swerve 6"" to the right I'll fall in a hole or hit a curb. Not usually a problem with actual bike lanes, but if there's no bike lane, this can be a real issue Trust me when I say, I want nothing less than to back up angry drivers behind me, so if I'm riding in the roadway I'm going to give you as much space as I can, or else get out of the roadway ASAP. Thanks, please don't yell at me any more."	SeattleWA

Intensity = Truth	"**Intensity = Truth** Something I do that deviates from the Neville's teachings is in the category of undesirable thoughts. I know in the topic of manifesting, undesirable thoughts are considered a no no. I understand completely why you would not want to think an undesirable thought. However, we must be honest with ourselves. There are thoughts in our minds that repeat themselves and at times we feel intense about them. Even when we try to think a different thought, the feelings of the undesirable thought linger on and makes it difficult to feel the desirable thought fully. I know in Neville's teachings, the way around this would be through understanding. Understand that you are withholding yourself in a State. You have the freedom to move into different States with no consequences. Give yourself this freedom and you will feel elated. This works for me. However... There are thoughts that are so stubborn and they feel so intense that sometimes understanding is not enough. For thoughts that seems to have lasting effects throughout the day, and causes you to feel down, worried, fearful, I do something, that at first may seem counterproductive. This is what I do: When I notice a thought that I deem ""undesirable,"" and this thought is giving me intense negative feelings such as fear, making my gut sink, worry and I simply cannot shake it off (This is only for stubborn thoughts, not ones that you can easy turn away from), I do this: >1. I identify the exact thought that is making me feel fear. > >2. I think of this thought deeply and why it is giving me fear. > >3. I keep repeating this thought on a loop and on each repeat I react to it less and less. > >4. Eventually you will come to a point where you are no longer reacting to the thought. Now after I do this. I go to the desirable thought I want to think. And this is what I do: >1. Think about the understand that you are simply withholding a State from yourself. Then think of the desirable thought. > >2. I feel the thought being fulfilled. > >3. I repeat this thought (visualize or speak) with feeling over and over. With each repetition, I feel it more intensely. > >4. I do this, like a rhythm, until all I feel and think are blissful thoughts and feelings. So, what exactly is being done here? With reacting less and less to the undesirable thought, you are taking away its power. The ONLY power it has, is in your reaction to it. With not reacting to it, it will no longer bother you. Then you cannot stop there. Stopping there will leave you feel neutral, which is not bad, but use this time to feel after your desire being fulfilled. With each repetition of feeling intensely about a desirable thought, you are fusing or identifying with that thought. From doing this with those stubborn thoughts, you will find that they will no longer bother you. You will also notice your mind will think, naturally, about the desirable thoughts because you feel intensely about them. Remember, your mind thinks truth is intensity. To the mind: Intensity = Truth As I said, this is my own method with stubborn thoughts. We all have a few, but I found this method to work. Hope it works for you as well."	EdwardArtSupplyHands

How do you be yourself everywhere you go?	Everyday is a challenge for me because I can only be myself in the company of myself.

My method is evolving!	"Thanks to the free time created by lockdown and some inspiration from you lovely people, I have been making some changes to my Dyna routine. I've been using the same 2018 M for years now, occasionally using it with my DIY jam jar water bubbler. That was it, no variation, nothing. It was almost becoming the same repetition that joint smoking had become. Soooo time for some changes! Firstly, I've made myself a 4"" wooden body to use around the house. The M body will still come camping and outdoors with me due to its durability, but this new wooden body has me feeling like a suave ass king now! The taste is great, no idea what type of wood - stick wood is my best guess, and the variety is really adding to the whole experience. I also made a 2.5"" wooden stubby for my pal - he's happy too. I had an offcut from all of this, so also made a 1"" water pipe adapter. Onto the jam jar bubbler! Guys, how has it taken me this long to ditch the water??? The taste is amazing!!! I was using it just with ice for a week, but now I've ditched that too and just leave the whole package in the freezer ready for when I need it. BOOM, no messing with ice or trying to toke up before the ice melts! Finally, all this gave me inspiration to clean everything. Like really clean everything. Yes I made a sweeet sweet reclaim coffee after dissolving pipes in milk, but then came the tools!! Scoring pads, ISO, Wire wool. Everything! Anyway, it tastes like new and I'm chuffed to pieces with my new ways. It's nearly 4.20 so its time for me to go load up. Thanks for the inspiration R/Dynavap!"	Dynavap

Halfords said their rear dashcam doubles up as a reversing camera. It does not. What can I do?	I am fucking livid. I went to Halfords and asked them to install a stereo, and asked for them to install a rear dashcam that can be used as a reversing camera too. They said the [HDC 400](https://www.halfords.com/technology/dash-cams/halfords-hdc400-dash-cam-535333.html) + [HDC-R](https://www.halfords.com/technology/dash-cams/halfords-hdc-r-rear-dash-cam-535341.html) was a great option. All in all I paid like ¬£600, went to reverse and the camera didn't come on the screen. Went back to Halfords a few days later and they told me it's not a reversing camera. I am fucking livid because I've already paid for it all. Is there anything I can do? They just said it's my problem and I can buy another reversing camera and pay for installation again.	AskUK

If this is a patch panel then I don't really need an AP right (plan is for GF to use wired connection upstairs assuming the patch panel is actually a patch panel)? Also planning to upgrade to gigabit internet. WFH due to COVID has warranted the upgrades and girlfriend needs a better connection upstairs since WiFi is inconsistent because of apartment layout/structure.	HomeNetworking

IT job market post-COVID?	Not sure if this is the right subred or category to post, but what is the IT job market like in the Texas area post-COVID? On one hand a lot of IT jobs can be work from remotely /home unlike flight attendants, pilots, hair salon, restaurant etc but on the other hand a lot of IT jobs can be more easily automated away compared to service sector gigs and since IT jobs tend to on average pay more then the employer has more incentive to cut/automate away even more. So all in all in relative terms, how is IT as in terms of job market doing in the age of COVID compared to other gigs?	sysadmin
Do people realise there's basically no evidence to suggest interest in GoT has reduced significantly?	"I could bore you all with a long list of television ratings, Google trends, and various IMDB visitor data suggesting that people still are completely fascinated by Game of Thrones. There's only one show that even comes close with interest a year later, and that's Breaking Bad. The narrative I see on the internet that ""no one cares about GoT anymore"" just doesn't add up when you actually start researching if that's true. People might not talk about it as much because they feel it's hard to do so without arguments, but there's an abundance of interest in various aspects of the show."	naath

Tips on Recovering from a Binge Sesh & Associated Shame/ Disappointment?	I‚Äôve been great about sticking to calorie limits (1750) for the first time in my life. Made it to about 5 weeks, and posted on r/progresspics (my main motivation), but deleted my post with the progress I was so proud of after receiving too many sexual DMs. Since then, I‚Äôve felt very low energy (‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù), have been oversleeping and had 3 days where I massively oversnacked (with an extra 2000+ calories). Does anyone have tips for renewing hope and motivation? I was so excited to watch the numbers on my scale go down, and now it all feels so out of reach/ pointless when I can wreck it all as easily as running to the store and eating too big a bag of chips. And it sucks to not be able to share my progress. Being sexualized for normal pics of my body just makes me want to hide my body and never show off my progress again.	loseit

Ever since his death, Kobe has been overrated.	Firstly, I think Kobe is one of the greatest players in basketball history and I don't think he is bad. Now that that is clarified, ever since Kobe's death I have seen more people than ever putting Kobe above Lebron James on GOAT lists for basketball. The popular opinion before his death was 1st Jordan, 2nd Lebron, and 3rd Kobe but now all of a sudden Kobe is almost always 2nd. I have no problem with people thinking Kobe is better than Lebron but I don't think it's fair nor would Kobe want to be considered better than another player, purely because he is dead and the other player is alive.	unpopularopinion

If you blew a long term quit and you‚Äôre struggling this is especially for you	Hey all, first post here. I‚Äôd like to share my story. I started smoking heavily at age 15. I also drank and was heavily dependent on a cocktail of substances that landed me in various rehabs and institutions over the years. At 22 I decided I wanted to get sober. I was going though all sorts of withdrawals (under medical care) and I reasoned if I had to endure this pain I might as well quit smoking at the same time also. 4 years and countless AA meetings later I‚Äôm completely sober and smoke free. My life is better than I could have ever imagined. I graduated college, I found myself a job, I‚Äôve got a pretty decent truck, and I even convinced a nice young lady to be my girlfriend. She smoked. I convinced myself I missed smoking. I told myself the cravings hadn‚Äôt gotten any better. So I shared a cigarette with her and my god was it disgusting. A few hours later I did it again. Next day I bought a pack and I was hooked like I never quit. A year and half later we broke up and I was probably averaging 30 cigs a day. I felt awful, I knew I smelled awful and I felt like I was never going to be able to quit again. I‚Äôd stop for a day, maybe even a week and just keep telling myself like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no point, I blew my 4 year quit... I‚Äôll never be able to go that long again.‚Äù Well I‚Äôm here to say I‚Äôve quit again. I‚Äôm approaching 3 years nicotine free again. I say nicotine free because trust me I‚Äôve chewed gum, I‚Äôve vaped, always to smoke again. I‚Äôve only ever found success facing the pain of withdrawal and coming out on the other side. That‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs experience and truth but it is mine. So today I‚Äôve been clean and sober from drugs for over 10 years and almost 3 years from cigarettes. I‚Äôve got my problems with mental health etc but nothing is worth smoking over. Stay strong DM me if you need support!!!	stopsmoking
Internal app with angularjs (v1) SPA front end, Laravel API backend and want to add AD login	i think i have read just about every page on MSAL and Azure AD but still struggling to figure out how to connect all the pieces for my particular application. There is a mix of internal users ([name@mycompany.com](mailto:name@mycompany.com)) and external users (customers, suppliers etc.). Currently all login with username and password stored in my application but I want to allow internal users to use their AD login. I want to add a Login with MS button and after successful authentication, syncs some of the user's data to their profile in my app database e.g. name, phone etc. I also want to flag them as being an AD user so I can then disable the editing of these things within my app. I will be working on a mobile app in the near future as well and require the same authentication. So, firstly I was wondering what my auth flow will be and think it is one of the following options: 1) Setup an Azure AD app with implicit flow and use MSAL.js to handle the login and then pass the token to my api which can then connect to Azure/Graph and sync the data and flag the user. I have actually got the first part of this working but can't figure out what i need to pass to my api as the token doesn't work. I am also aware that implicit seems to be not preferred due to security issues 2) When user clicks login button, redirect them to my api which then does a auth redirect flow. I still have the issue of redirecting back to my frontend with some sort of cookie. This method doesn't really work with the mobile app so I think 1) is the only way to do it.	AZURE

I've also struggled with depression and the thought of continuing to not enjoy sex as much as I could is sending me back down. I know this community will be supportive and helpful. Thanks for reading.	NoFap

[BF4] campaign assignments	bf4 campaign assignments not awarded yesterday i played through the entire bf4 campaign so I could unlock the p90 for multiplayer. After i beat the campaign i went into multiplayer to use it and it wasn‚Äôt unlocked. I looked at my single player assignments and it said i had 0/8 or whatever it is. I know i completed almost all of them because i would unlock them at the end of the mission. Is there any way to fix this besides replaying the campaign? PS4	Battlefield

RE3 DLC?	My first play through I was really disappointed that they omitted the clock tower, but my second play through, I noticed the time between Carlos getting to Jill seemed really long since it said like half a day and that that is the only part of the game where it isn‚Äôt specific about the exact time. And he got to Jill from the inside of the clock tower. I haven‚Äôt read anything about DLC, but does anyone think Carlos going through the clock tower might be some type of DLC speed run type mission? It just seemed really odd to me that it took a half a day for him to get from the police station to the clock tower and that he showed up from inside of it. Maybe he could go through the park as well?	residentevil

Wife has boyfriend, contacted lawyer.	My wife has taken advantage of me for the last time, today I contacted a lawyer. She is a taker, never a giver and I have nothing more to give. My giving well is empty after she always drew from it but never replenished the reservoir. A giant weight has been lifted, I'm 40 with a 17 year old son who will be a senior this year. I'm hold fast for the next six months, I want to see if the housing market tanks so I can keep the home, and finish raising my son in it. Only 60K in equity, I need the market to correct 25% so my mortgage will be underwater when I file. I have a good rate, screw selling the home and it's in my name. We have 5 acers of land in the hills, worth about 60K, but the well doesn't work, so I think I can get it down to 45K in worth, which equals out debt. I want to keep the house, keep my land, keep the debt, and she can go draw from her bum of a boyfriend's well. Have fun you toxic POS, the war has begun!	Divorce

Anybody here ever microdosing psychedelics?	I‚Äôve been microdosing .05-.1 of mushrooms and it‚Äôs really helped me be honest with myself and create new ways to effectively compile my thoughts by journaling. I‚Äôve never had those thoughts in one place besides my head so I‚Äôve never been able to look at them holistically until now. It‚Äôs helping me push aside (not completely stave off) a lot of doubt I had in my prior transition (I detransd) and am on my second transition that began with a fuck ton of doubt. But when your life is shit already there‚Äôs not much left to lose. So I took the plunge and a day after my first day back on HRT I‚Äôve been microdosing the mushrooms and Again it‚Äôs helped me a lot... anybody have a similar experience?	asktransgender

I have an idea for an add on (Maths specifically). But I‚Äôm not sure if it is possible.	So first off, if this already exists, let me know. I‚Äôll present this as the current problem we have, and a proposed solution. Problem: Let‚Äôs say for example we are trying to learn the mean(Statistics). The mean is the sum of all the numbers / total number of numbers. And let‚Äôs also take into consideration, that the best way to learn Maths(or a good technique anyway) is to practise problems/equations over and over again(like we do in school). So if we were to learn the mean with Anki, we could have a Question like: Calculate the mean of 4, 5, 6, 2, 9, 3, 4, 6, 8 The problem here is that this same question will be repeated and always have the same answer. The dilemma is we will be so familiar with the numbers we see that we will automatically know the answer without even have to do the calculation. THIS IS NOT LEARNING. This is association(muscle memory of sorts). Solution: So how would we combat this? Well in school we do. We practise mean by doing mean equations with a different set of numbers each time. Forcing us to do the calculation in order to get the answer. That‚Äôs the trick, there‚Äôs no longer a memorisation of an answer to a set of numbers because the numbers are always ransoms. Implementing this idea in Anki would be great(in my opinion). So how would this work? We could enter the equation for the mean into Anki and have it associated with the card(this mean equation will not be visible to viewer when reviewing) The Anki question will generate random numbers for the Question part, and enter these numbers into the equation to get the answer for the answer part. We now have random numbers so we are forced to do the mean calculation every time Thoughts?	Anki

[m4A/a] Terrible, Dreadful Feminization	A lot of gender transformation content, be it stories, captions, or comics, end with a clean-cut ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù. The guy turns female, and while at first he might hate it, he learns to love *her* new body. Things generally end alright for her, and in many cases, she‚Äôs in a better spot than when she started. This is not one of those scenarios. Something that‚Äôs always fascinated me about transformation in general is the feeling of dread and terror in can evoke. This is primarily the case in the body horror genre, but I believe it can take place in the gender transformation niche as well. Let‚Äôs be real here, if you did start to lose shrink inch by inch, wouldn‚Äôt you be worried? When your chest began to grow flabby, and latter expand outwards into blossoming breasts, wouldn‚Äôt you be at least a tad concerned? And when your memories themselves started to slip away, and you found your formerly masculine self began dreaming about lip gloss and dresses, wouldn‚Äôt terror shoot up your spine? In short, I‚Äôm interested about exploring how horrifying it‚Äôd be to go from a perfectly masculine guy into a giggly girly girl. Ideally, the transformation should be slow and drawn out; all the more time to appreciate the impending doom. If you‚Äôre interested in this sort of transformation, hit me up. I‚Äôd love to either just chat about our mutual interests, or work out an RP. **No Reddit Chat please** Kinks (not all kinks listed needed to be discussed or incorporated): Gender transformation, slow-burn transformations, girly-girls, bimbofication, girly outfits, mental alterations, identity death, bad ends.

China Asked The WHO To Help Cover Up Coronavirus, German Intelligence Concludes	[China Asked The WHO To Help Cover Up Coronavirus, German Intelligence Concludes](https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/09/china-who-coronavirus-coverup-germany/) >Chinese Leader Xi Jinping personally asked the World Health Organization to delay the release of critical information regarding its coronavirus outbreak, German intelligence has concluded. >Xi met with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on January 21 to request that he withhold information about human-to-human transition and delay the declaration of a global pandemic, according to [German magazine Der Spiegel. - | *Does Beijing have to pay for the pandemic damage?*| ](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/corona-ausbruch-vertuscht-muss-china-fuer-die-pandemie-schaeden-zahlen-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000170816271) The news comes amid rising sentiment that China should be held financially responsible for the pandemic. >**‚ÄúThe BND‚Äôs* verdict is harsh: At least four, if not six, weeks have been lost in Beijing‚Äôs information policy in the fight against the virus,‚Äù Der Spiegel reported.** (emphasis mine) *BND is the native German acronym for its Federal Intelligence Service. ---------------- [Lawfare:](https://www.lawfareblog.com/covid-19-lawsuits-against-china) >At least six lawsuits have been filed against China in U.S. federal courts seeking damages for deaths, injuries and economic losses caused by covid-19. Members of Congress have drafted legislation to strip China of its immunity from suit in U.S. courts. Even if enacted, these congressional efforts are unlikely to pave the way for successful lawsuits ‚Äî and they could prompt China to take reciprocal measures against the United States. China should be held accountable in other ways, including through diplomatic pressure and a thorough U.S. investigation of Beijing‚Äôs role in concealing and failing to stop the spread of covid-19. ------------ Global Times: >[COVID-19 lawsuits against China are illegal by international law](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1187897.shtml) >These international claims against China are mainly being carried out in two ways. First, by filing lawsuits against China in domestic US courts; and second, by appealing to international legal institutions for possible recompense. >Suing China in US courts can be argued as vexatious litigation. As a sovereign state, China is immune from the jurisdiction of any foreign court. This is China's right under international law, not some privilege granted by foreign countries. Therefore, suing China in a US court challenges the doctrine of sovereign immunity and disrupts the international order. ------------------- * Should immunity from prosecution of China be reversed? * Do you think China should be held responsible for the Covid19 outbreak? * Doing a search on this issue you will find many articles all stating it would be illegal and il-advised to sue China over this issue. Do you believe these articles (written almost daily in various medias ) are all organic in nature, or do you believe there is a coordinated effort to let China off the hook for the spread of Covid19. -*remember, china prohibited flights out of wuhan into other areas of china, while allowing international flights out of wuhan to continue - this is a proven fact.*	CoronaVirusInfo

I've never had ANYONE leave a match before ranked was released	Please RIOT do something. 50% of the ranked games I've played had 1 or 2 players leaving of AFK'ing after 3 rounds.

I've never experienced any such thing from any other video game I ever played (except LoL - for some reason :) - but even there it's not THIS bad) This is unacceptable, especially considering that I've NEVER EVER experienced such thing BEFORE ranked was released. **It's clearly a sign that certain players can't handle the pressure.** Maybe have a behavior score that pairs leavers with other leavers?

This gem from r/banvideogames	Not all gamers are bad. In fact, there are good ones. For example, I'm a good gamer.

I don't go and call people disrespectful things. Yeah, I may see inappropriate things in games sometimes, but I don't let that influence me. I know that things I do in games should stay in games. If anything, gaming to me is nothing more than entertainment and a way of passing time. Just because a few gamers have done bad stuff in the past, it doesn't mean that all gamers are like that, and I certainly won't let videogames have that effect on me. But I'm still going to keep playing, because I enjoy it, as I have done for about 10 years. Downvote, brigade, do whatever. I don't care. But at the end of the day, I'm trying to prove a point here.	copypasta

Pick A Card, Any Card	This is a (not entirely sure honestly) **Specialist/Conjuration** technique. # Pick A Card, Any Card The user **Conjures** a nen space where he and the opponent are surrounded by **54** playing cards facing downwards. The space is conjured by saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to pick a card.‚Äù The user and his opponent cannot harm each other or the nen space while the game is active. The user and the opponent must each pick up one card, the cards have the effects that follow: * **Hearts/Diamonds** grant positive effects or boosts to whoever picks them up. These effects are scaled in power depending on the card picked up. (**Two** being the lowest, **Ace** being the highest). * **Spades/Clubs** place negative effects on whoever picks them up. These effects are scale in power depending on the card picked up. (**Two** being the lowest, **Ace** being the highest.) * **Jokers** are instant death to whoever picks them up. # Conditions/Limitations * Once the room is **conjured** the user must explain the game he and his opponent will be playing to allow the cards to appear. * The **cards** spawn at random every time this ability is used and are indiscernible from one another. * The **user** is just as susceptible to the negative effects of the cards as his opponent. * Once each player has picked a card the game ends and they are transported back to the real world. * The **positive/negative** effects of the cards are random depending on who picks them up. * If the ability is used in the same opponent, the cards drawn are **NOT** added back into the pool of cards until all the cards have been drawn. (Ex. You draw a 5 of spades, the next time the game is played the 5 of spades is not in the room.) Das it. This is an ability for a villain (obviously). Basically it's someone you would see in an anime such as Kakegurui, they get off to gambling and the rush of putting their life and other person's on the line. Hope you enjoyed	HatsuVault

[Help] Should we get another Minature Poodle, or one of these following breeds? (Coton, Lhasa Apso, Havanese or Bichon Frise)	"**Introduction** 1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? * We have a 12-year-old miniature poodle mix. The SO has had him since the poodle was a puppy. I've been with him for the past three years. I really enjoy training him. 2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? * We're looking into a breeder. 3) Describe your ideal dog. * I prefer a dog that's easily trainable. I love teaching the miniature poodle little tricks. I also prefer a dog with a long life span, that feels ""sturdy."" We are looking for a gentle dog, that will be good with other dogs and children in the future. We want a dog that can tolerate both cold weather (the 20s-30s) and really hot humid weather easily. My SO wants a dog that he can go on long walks with. We want a calmer dog. My SO has horrible allergies, so we want a dog that doesn't shed at all. 4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? * Minature Poodle - We have one. He's so easy to train. He's intelligent, sweet, and loving. He's a peacemaker, he wants everyone to get along and it's hard to be mad when he prances over to make things better. He doesn't shed. We trust him to stay with us on a walk. We enjoy watching him explore his world and figure out new things, his intelligence is very apparent. **However**, we're looking at other breeds cause he can be VERY sensitive and startle easily. He can also be very stubborn, he knows how to come, but he probably won't unless he feels like it. He's also independent....he'll cuddle but ONLY on his terms and when he feels like it. He's not very playful or goofy, he's a serious and proud dog. He also requires a lot of stimulation since he's so smart. He figures out new puzzles and kongs so quickly. This is great when we want to go on a 2-hour walk, but not so great at 1 pm in the middle of a work meeting or after a long day when we just want to chill. Also, he has a strong prey drive which can make walks difficult when all of a sudden he lunges at a bird out of nowhere, it is kind of nice though cause he catches bugs for us sometimes. * Havanese - Seem similar to a poodle, but more playful and goofy. I've heard they're harder to train and it can take MONTHS to potty train. This wouldn't be great since we live in an apartment and work full-time, but we are fans of the lower energy level. A straight coat is also appealing since the curly coat is hard to brush out every day, but we've heard they shed more than a Minature Poodle. * Coton - This is the breed we're looking at the most. They seem exactly like poodles, except with lower energy and less sensitive and more playful. Which seems perfect. We're not sure about how much they shed though. There also doesn't seem to be as much information about their temperament in general since they're a newer breed. * Lhasa Paso - They are really cute, and seem really sturdy for smaller dogs. However, we've heard that they can be quite territorial and dominant. Our poodle can be territorial at times, but for the most part he likes strangers. He won't wander off with them, but he's fine with them being around. I've heard they're not great with small kids either. However, they're intelligent and really trainable without having a high energy level. That's why we're looking at this breed. * Bichon Frise - Just like the Coton, they seem similar to Poodles in temperament but just more relaxed about everything and have less energy. Unlike the Coton, they seem not as trainable. 5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? * We love training our current dog to do ""cute"" tricks (wave, high five, etc). We also like playing games with him (guess which hand, find it, hide and seek). We also enjoy doing agility training with him, although it's more of a once in a while thing because we live in an apartment so we have to go out to a training center. 6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? * We don't want to complete, but it is fun to train this stuff just for fun. I enjoy it as a bonding experience with my dog. However, it does kind of feel like our current poodle NEEDS this type of training to tire him out. I'd rather do the training when I feel like it. **Care Commitments** 7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? * Our current poodle gets 1 hour - 3 hours of walks a day. The 1 hour is only when we're too busy to do otherwise and we can tell it's too little for him. He gets really restless and starts nosing us for attention and can't settle down. That's the hard part. We also do 30 minutes of training a day, he does better with more but he's able to pick up new stuff with 30 minutes because he can train so easily. So we'd like another dog that we can train with that kind of time commitment as well. We also really want to have our dog lay by us while we do stuff (work, watch tv, hobbies). With our current dog, it's more like once we have a moment it's time to go outside or train him, and ONCE he's properly tired out, we can chill. That's really exhausting and unenjoyable on days we're super busy, which lately seems like more days than not. 8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? * 1 hour - 3 hours depending on the days, and it'll be walks. We don't like using dog walks since we live in a city and there's no segregation between the smaller and large dog sections. 9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? * We will take our dog to the groomer once a week. We do daily brushing for the poodle, we could use a bit of a lower maintenance coat. Maybe a weekly brush instead of a daily brush. **Personal Preferences** 10) What size dog are you looking for? * We want a smaller dog, but not a teeny tiny dog. Our poodle is around 15 lbs and about a foot tall. We want a dog around that size. 11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? * No shedding or slobber. We can handle minimal barking. Our dog barks occasionally when he hears a lot of noise outside, and we wouldn't want more than that. 12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? * This would be really nice to do as it's hard to find fenced-in areas for us. My parents have a large unfenced lawn. We trust our current dog to stay by us enough for us to let go of the leash, but we never take the leash completely off. In case he sees a bird and starts darting towards it. **Dog Personality and Behavior** 13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? * Snuggly dog, but one that's okay with being away for us when we need to work. We want a dog that'll cuddle with us when we want to cuddle and is okay chilling when we can't. Right now it's the opposite, we're more on our dog's schedule than the other way around lol. 14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please? * Eager to please.... but on our terms. Again, when we're working we want a dog to settle down. 15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? * We prefer that our dog is excited to meet strangers and visitors when they're coming in. We like what our current poodle does, if he thinks we're not aware of someone (like if he sees someone in my parents' yard), he'll bark to alert us to them. But if they're coming into the house and it's clear that we know, he doesn't care. He also doesn't care if walkers come into the house to take him out and he doesn't know them. 16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? * No, we have an existing senior dog. It's important that this dog tolerates other dogs. 17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid? * Biting, territorial, guarding, excessive barking, and shedding. **Lifestyle** 18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? * 8-10 hours a day once corona is over, with a walker coming in during mid-day to take them out. 19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? * My SO will be involved in taking care of the dog, he doesn't enjoy doing training but he likes going on long walks around the city and cuddling with the dog while playing video games/watching TV. 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? * We have an existing Minature Poodle Mix. Mixed with Maltese, but his personality/appearance is solely Minature Poodle. 21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? * Yes, we plan on having kids in the next 5 years. The exact timeline is not yet determined. 22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? * We currently rent. There are no restrictions though. 23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? * Washington DC, and yes 24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? * In the summer, it's an average of 80-90, but often gets into the 100s. It's also extremely humid, so it feels a lot hotter than it is. In the winter it stays around 40 degrees but can dip into the 20s for a few weeks. It also rains a lot. **Additional Information and Questions** * No additional information. 26) Feel free to ask any questions below. * As we've said, we have a miniature poodle but are looking at a few other breeds (Coton, Lhasa Apso, Havanese & Bichon). I was hoping to get some feedback so we can make the best decision for our family. Thank you in advance for those who take the time to read all of this! I really appreciate it."	dogs

Sugar free Jello... pros and cons	"5'6"" 28m 260lbs here. I've always had a sweet tooth and have found myself turning towards sugar free jello here lately. I know that artificial sweeteners aren't good for you, but I'm wanting to lose quite a bit of weight and obtain a healthier lifestyle. I'm just now starting to try to get more active and start walking several times a week. In terms of sweets/cheats, I'm not going to be able to give them up. I'll be honest. My issue is portion control and I feel like for the most part jello is a guilt free item. But what exactly are the pros and cons of sugar free jello? Will this have a negative impact on my goals or is it a better alternative to mindlessly eating snacks? I'm new here, but already feel better seeing how supportive some of these communities are. Any tips or suggestions are very much appreciated."	loseit

Question about More Time Ready (MTR) program	We are set to have a shift drop tomorrow - 5/12. No one seems to know (not even managers) what week the shifts are dropping for. Most of us are gold and already have shifts for next week. If the MTR shifts drop for the following week (week of 5/19) we won't be able to pick them up because we're already scheduled. Should we drop what we have and wait on the MTR shifts? If we do that, and the shifts drop, like they do for Gold, two weeks out (week of 5/26) we won't meet the 30 hour minimum required for MTR.

"Is it realistic that characters, when told ""Get away from there NOW!"" by a close person, do not take that seriously?"	"I have seen this multiple times in TV shows/animations/movies, etc. When the protagonist, upon receiving information that a family member/close friend etc will encounter a great danger (i.e., the building will explode, or a serial murderer is coming there right now), calls the person shouting ""There's no time! Get away from there, NOW!"", and the person is just asking ""What do you mean? Why should I leave?"" etc wasting time. In some cases, even when the protagonist told the reason ""Someone is coming to kill you!"", the person asks ""who is that person?"" etc, wasting time. And then they die or get killed. Is this a realistic reaction for the most people? I am asking because I would run away as fast I can without wasting the time asking for more questions."	NoStupidQuestions

Pickup tower woes, what could I have done differently?	"Warning, I am a customer, not an associate, so have your kid-gloves ready please. So I bought a blender on Walmart.com using ship-to-shore, I've bought other things using ship-to-store before and it was always relatively smooth and expedient, albeit this was my first time ordering to this particular store. it comes to the store a week later and I get there at 7 am to avoid the covid crazies and do some grocery shopping before the pickup tower is open. At 8:45 am I check out my groceries and head to the tower to pick up my order. No one else is there so I assume it shouldn't take very long. I attempt to check in using the screen on the pickup tower itself and it tells me ""error communicating with the tower!"". Okay fine I'll just check in on my phone, so I do. My name pops up on the screen and says ""checked in"" and the computer tells me to wait for an associate to bring me my order. 10 minutes go by and nobody seems to notice me as my cold groceries get warmer, fortunately I didn't buy any ice cream. I ask the person at the customer service desk if I'm supposed to go find someone to help me get my order and he tells me he'll put in a call over the PA for me. He does and I return to the tower. 10 more minutes go by and still nothing. At this point I've been passed by no less than 10 different associates of various departments: yellow vests, dark blue vests, cart wranglers, people wearing walkies, and one woman not in uniform but wearing a large Walmart ID badge and carrying a walkie who I assumed must be someone important. For context I'm not an easily overlooked person, I'm a 6'4"" man wearing a tie-dye shirt and palm tree print shorts. I didn't want to be *""that guy""* so I wait another 5 minutes before calling the number on the sign nearby that says it's a direct line to the pickup staff, someone answers the phone and tells me they'll get my order for me. 5 more minutes go by and I see the guy they have guarding the front gate (due to covid) come in and when he sees me he says over his walkie ""OGP you have a customer waiting at the pickup tower"" and lets me know they're getting my order. After 5 more minutes of sweating cheese, thawing meat, and googling what OGP meant (I now know it means Online Grocery Pickup) I finally spot someone approaching me with a box who hands it to me and says ""here you go, have a nice day"". I quickly thank him and leave. Now, I've worked several retail jobs before so I know that shit happens: the computers are buggy, people don't show up for their shift, everywhere is chronically understaffed, etc. So I'm not really upset at the employees (I'm not going complain to corporate either, I know that doesn't do any good and just harms the people on the bottom.) in this situation, what I want to know is how can I avoid this situation in the future without being a real Karen? Obviously getting my pickup order before shopping for groceries is at the top of my list but that means I'm forced to shop around *more* people at a time like this, and also it doesn't alleviate the unacceptable ~40 minutes of waiting...

I think I broke my nose on my daughter's head.	I was doing a workout and foolishly closed my eyes for a brief moment while bending over. I didnt know she walked in front of me and smashed my nose with her head. I heard a nasty crunch and now my head is POUNDING. She's fine. It just knocked her over and she's confused as to why I'm in pain. She keeps bringing me toys to make me feel better and giving me hugs.	FML
"Xbox One ""Map Failed to Load"" Question"	I was curious, I had the issue at the second meeting of the gods, and eventually plowed through it and the ship map loaded. So my question is, I deleted all my saves and created a new one, should I keep playing or should it uninstall, delete and start a brand new file? If I do That will I still have all my Berath Blessings? I have No issue starting over if I can get a quick bump to get me a head start with the Blessings. &#x200B; Anyone try this before or know what to do when you get the Message?	projecteternity
It's so annoying when people type like 'omgggg did you see thatttt I knnnoooowwww'.	(This is a lame one.) Maybe most adults can't relate with this, and I'm pretty sure this is a preteen-teen thing, but pretty much everyone I know texts like, 'Omggg, thankkkk youuuu Ilyyyyyyy' and it's SO annoying. Better use caps or a bunch of exclamation marks. But please, please for the love of God, don't use dragged letters. It's so pissinggggg offffff (see?). I'm not even talking about an exclamation per se. I'm talking about regular conversations. Maybe something like, 'Did you hear what Sara said about Julie?' and the response goes something like, 'dudeeeee yaaaaa I can't evennnnnnn'. Maybe I'm just weird in that sense, but I end up reading it as 'dudeyyyyyyy'. Hopefully this is a habit people grow out of, because it's frustrating.	unpopularopinion
DM possesses my character for no reason , I get really salty	Am I just salty or is my DM not managing the story correctly ? Okay ,because this story‚Äôs characters are similar in their class and race I will refer to them with appropriate numbers. So , the story starts with our party traveling by ship in order to cross a big ocean dividing the two lands . We were about level 5 , me being a wizard and my friends playing as two monks and two fighters (Yeah , I know , what a diverse group) . Anyway , as we were traveling a strange melody, which was caused by Sirens ( a redesigned version of the Harpy , used by our DM to make a similar encounter while keeping the underwater theme) lured the ship‚Äôs crew along with two of our party members . Me and one fighter 1 were almost lured but managed to lock the door of the storage space before we could proceed any further . Fighter 2 nearly jumped as monk 1 (who succeeded on the saving throw) grabbed him and tied him up with a rope. Monk 2 jumped down and was nearly brought to the bottom of the ocean by the ‚Äúharpies‚Äù. After monk 1 tried to help us regain our conscience by slapping the hell out of us , he managed to persuade the fighter to dive and try to rescue monk 2 , in which he succeeded . As he was being pulled up by the string we tied him to so we could be sure he wouldn‚Äôt die , a bunch of weird sea creatures started to appear in 2 waves . Wave 1 consisted of 8 enemies while wave 2 consisted of 11 . They slowly started climbing our ship and walking on the deck , Spears in hand .As I was pretty low on hp , I decided it was time to devise my master plan . A while back we had defeated a necromancer whose scepter was a powerful magical item . We decided to use his skull and create an all-powerful scepter which according to the DM made all spells deal only necrotic damage and dealt an additional d4 for all necromancy spells . Not that bad of an item at this level , but knowing my DM I suspected that there would be something wrong with it . I rolled multiple investigation checks , one being a nat20 that along with my +8 modifier should be pretty trustable . He said the same thing he told us about it the previous time and continued on narrating . So , when the time came for me to use it , I thought that I could turn the fireball‚Äôs damage to necrotic and use it against the crowd of enemies while not hurting our ship (materials are immune to necrotic damage). Instead , an army of black smoke undead was released which killed everything except our party on sight while the scepter burnt my left hand and after that my right one as I proceeded to hold it still in order to maintain control of the black smoke undead army . After that the army surrounded the rest of the party and pretty much scared the hell out of them . At that moment a black cloak appeared and covered me , in an attempt to posses me . The cloak pulled me upward and as I slowly became a dark figure I approached the party and fused with the smoke to create an illusion of a dragon head . My party immediately recognized it as we had engaged with him in a fight and eventually killed him , struggling to remain alive in the process. Anyway , the dragon talked about a curse and slowly disappeared, creating an object similar to a sphere that was extremely dark but seemed like a very reflective surface . That was when the DM told me I disappeared in the darkness , along with everything else that had threatened the party. Fighter 1 , being a dwarf , kicked it as far as he could knocking it back and creating a vision for the rest of the party which basically pictured me walking and getting on my knees along with other people who seemed a lot like necromancers(I had also picked the school of Necromancy while our main antagonist was one , yeah I know , bad life decisions.). They were all bowing down to a man in a throne , and the vision ended with me looking at them with a faceless expression , indicating that I have been probably possessed . Now ,May I add the fact that after using the staff to perform the spell , My dm never asked for a single save . He basically took control of my character by telling me a lie about a magic item which we ourselves had created and then sent me to a place I can do nothing about and told me to roll up a new sheet . All that story and connection and bonding between the part for the DM to ruin it by sending me to the Shadow Realm or something . The party was pretty upset as I was the only one to be able to control the ship and every other person had attack spells apart from me , who had a mixture of everything . The session ended with monk 2 (who I could have easily stabilized with toll the dead or helped with my healing supplies and +8 in medicine) grasping to breath and being between life and death while the other characters got in an argument about the sphere . TL;DR : DM lied about an item so I would use it and get banished and possessed for a long time for whatever reason and now my party is in desperate need of help , as I have no way of introducing my new character in the ship. Edit : Sorry for any structural or grammatical errors , English isn‚Äôt my natural language so yeah. P.S:Any comment discussing a fault of mine or the DMs would be very much appreciated, as Want my party to stay together and as far as I‚Äôve been part of this adventure I‚Äôve had a pretty good time	rpghorrorstories

LPT: If you want to multiply numbers without actually multiplying, learn the square numbers.	Here‚Äôs the algorithm. Take two numbers. Take the sum of the numbers and the difference of the numbers. Then divide both by two. Then take the difference of the squares. This only works for when both numbers are odd or even. If one is even and the other odd, the divide out the 2 and multiply it in at the end. For example. 7 * 13 would require a pen and paper right? Wrong. 13 + 7= 20 => 20/2 = 10 13 - 7 = 6 => 6/2 = 3 Then 10^2 =100, 3^2 =9 The answer is 100 - 9 = 91	LifeProTips

Everyone is having less sex, not just men.	[https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-lose-virginity-later-than-previous-generations-2018-5?r=US&IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-lose-virginity-later-than-previous-generations-2018-5?r=US&IR=T) According to the 'Next Steps' longitudinal study in the UK and data from them National Centre for Health Statistics in the US, the age at which young people lose their virginity is rising, for both men and women. Additionally, the average number of sexual partners had by each person is decreasing, and is much lower than that of our parents. A common facet of TRP is the idea of female hypergamy - that a small number of men are sexually monopolising a greater body of women. This at first seems like a reasonable perspective for men to have, with them generally struggling more on the most popular medium to find sexual/romantic partners at the current time - online dating. They outnumber women on dating profiles, and generally receive less likes, matches and attention. From their perspective, women are all easily finding hookups while they cannot. If this is true, then why is it that women are also statistically having less sex? Whats happening here? What about the 'cock carousel'? The answer is fairly simple: the idea of female hypergamy is flawed, because the subgroup of women participating in it is small in the same way that the subgroup of men who are capable of participating in it is small. Women are simply choosing not to hook up, even if it would be comparatively easier for them to be successful in doing so. Overall, this balances out and both genders are having less sexual activity. Why are many women choosing not to participate in hookup culture? We can only guess. Anecdotally (which isn't worth much) as a 19 year old college student, most of my peers are other females and most of us spend a large portion of our time working on schoolwork (in a relatively intense STEM program) or participating in sports, clubs or student societies. Most of us are uninterested in hooking up, want relationships, but do not realistically have the time for them. The result is that we are all effectively celibate, despite TRP stating the opposite. Fundamentally, I think most women would prefer a relationship to a ONS. When a relationship is not realistically attainable for a woman (due to being busy with other things, or just not that interested in dating at that time), women remove themselves from the sexual marketplace altogether, leading to a kind of dating pool 'inflation'. I think TRP is flawed at the point at which it misunderstands where modern issues in sexual relationships stem from; which is that women are simply more content being celibate and single than men are.

[HUGE spoilers for season 1] a summary of season 1's main events. [like seriously, this spoils everything, go watch the show if you haven't already]	"so [u/KaylieKonrad](https://www.reddit.com/user/KaylieKonrad/) posted wanting a recap of season 1 as it's been a while. I was originally going to comment on there, but it turned out to be so long I thought some other people could make some use of it, seeing that season 2 just got released a couple days ago. i'm assuming you know the basic storyline, three teens wake up in a room unsure of who or where they are, they solve puzzles and get out of bad situations all whilst trying to get home, theorising on where they are and get help from an omniscient and omnipotent god. so let's get deeper than just a very brief summary: the three main characters, Adam, Mira and Kai wake up in a bunker and solve a puzzle to get out, their main goal from the beginning is to get home and not die along the way, while theorising on where they are and why they're in this strange world. along the way, they meet this strange guy who can help them get out of situations and shed light on where they are, in a cryptic kinda way. they each discover that they have superpowers, Adam has super strength, Kai can control fire and knows a lot about mechanics and electronics, and Mira can breathe underwater, swim extremely well and speak to animals. after they make bonds, discover their powers, become comfortable in the world and make sense of things, they start to adjust and focus their energy on getting home. after falling through a portal the strange guy put there, they meet a talking tree who is missing a branch. the tree tells them that if they can get the branch back from some devil monks, she can take them home. the branch, as it turns out, is an insanely powerful weapon called the Ishibo. they manage to retrieve it from the monks after their leader falls to his death, but another group of three teens (ill call them group 2) who also have superpowers show up and steal it, making a quick getaway. After finding which direction group 2 went in, they find themselves in a western town, where they meet group 2, and this time have a civil discussion with them. group 2 is made up of Vanessa, Skeet and Reeve, who have powers of flight, speed and telekinesis respectively. Vanessa charms Kai into teaming up with group 2, but Adam and Mira aren't so trusting. Skeet and Reeve tell the trio that they lost the Ishibo, and the plan for the groups is to team up and retrieve the Ishibo, find the tree and go home together. However, Adam and Mira fall into a network of tunnels after getting ambushed by zombies, leaving Kai with group 2 and nowhere else to go. we follow Adam and Mira in the underground tunnels, and they meet a blind old man called Dave who guides them through the catacombs, he basically tells them to go find an ice castle and retrieve the Ishibo. when they get out of the tunnels, Adam sees Dave glitch in a way, he flickers, and Adam is rightfully spooked. He proposes a theory that they're in a videogame and that they need to ""win"" to go home. they get yeeted by the talking tree because they dont have the Ishibo and end up at the ice palace, where they see that group 2 and Kai are frozen in blocks of ice, with the Ishibo frozen with them. Kai escapes the ice using his firepower, and Adam tells Kai to melt the Ishibo out of the ice, but not group 2. Kai refuses as he has trust in group 2, and unfreezes them. group 2 betray them and attack Adam with the Ishibo, fatally wounding him. Vanessa insults Kai greatly and he is visibly hurt by this. they escape the ice castle and end up on the shores of a human-spider infested island. Adam is unconscious gets kidnapped along with Kai and Mira. Kai also used the last of their help from the weird guy.just before they got kidnapped, the weird guy shows up after a glitching spaceship crashes out of the sky, and tells them that the game is hella glitchy and they need to get out as soon as possible. Kai and Mira are taken to see the king spider centaur type thing, and he says he doesn't trust humans after group 2 cut off two of his legs. Kai fixes his legs, the spider heals Adam, and the trio is back on track. They ambush group 2, retrieve the Ishibo and head to the talking tree. She opens up a gateway for them, and the game is super glitchy at this point. they go to the final level, fight a dragon, jump through the portal, press a button and win the game. i tried to summarise the things that were only crucial to the storyline, i'll have missed riddles and foreshadowing for this reason, but if there's anything important i've managed to skip, please let me know. tl:dr - i honestly cant summarise the show much more than this, sorry folks"	TheHollowNetflix
New to Apex in S4, got 10 wins with each legend (stats and hopefully new player guide)	I am not good, let‚Äôs start there. I‚Äôm 42 dad with 3 kids but I wanted to get into apex to play w some friends. Everyone talks mains but I never stick w 1 character so decided to do them all. Hopefully this helps other new players decide who is ‚Äúeasier?‚Äù To start with. Win rate from best to worst and a quick new player opinion. Wide mix of ranked/pubs, 50/50 solo or in a group. 1.Pathfinder- I got the hang of his grapple pretty quick (probably from other games I‚Äôve played) and once I did wow he is so fun and strong. Imo he‚Äôs the best and a must have on every team 2. Gibby- Perfect new player legend, brings so much to the table. 3. Crypto- I‚Äôll be upfront, I watched a bunch of videos prior to playing him. He was so fun to use but unless you wanna put in time to be good with him he‚Äôs really tough to play for new players (I definitely hurt my team when I first started) 4. Revenant (after buff)- Another really good new player legend imo. Use the totem going into every fight, pretty straight forward, if you get off a bunch of damage push if not quick heal and go again 5. Caustic - Started slow but really started hitting many wins once I got a hang of his kit. Very fun to use and great for a new player that might not have positioning down 6. Bang- Good legend for new players, speed boost to get out of trouble with smoke and ult to help you position. (Just please don‚Äôt shoot the smoke at the enemy, smoke yourself to get away and heal) 7. Watson- Being able time block out some areas and eat grenades definitely won me a few games. Wasn‚Äôt a quick learn though by any means 8. Mirage - I love the decoys man, won me so many 1v1 fights. Also really good when looting boxes or figuring out where the heck you got shot from. 9. Wraith- I know how great she is but I just didn‚Äôt pick up that style quickly, the difference between an ok and good Wraith is huge. 10. Bloodhound- Great to know where people are but the ult is just not for me, too jarring of a screen change. Also I felt like people learned to react to his tactical. 11. Lifeline (played her after nerf). I don‚Äôt like support anyways and that seems to be the only thing she brings to table. It was a struggle. 12. Octane - I put up good kill games with him but just struggled to win. Late game he just doesn‚Äôt bring much imo Hope that helps someone (with less time than I) pick a legend that gets them into the game!	apexlegends

Why I ended up with Milwaukee tools	The wife and I do stuff like this on weekends. DIY, but fairly hard-core. With limited time, we don't have time for stuff to break down or not work. (I don't know how many near wrecks this little visual circus caused. Something about a porch sitting on supports made people rubberneck to the extent that they'd damn near drive into parked cars while staring.) &#x200B; [The top of this porch was pretty decent.

It‚Äôs getting hard	It‚Äôs getting really hard to believe that God loves me. I was 100% healthy my whole life. Then in 2016 everything changed and it just keeps getting worse and worse. I‚Äôve had health anxiety my whole life but I had it under control for the most part. In 2016 my mom has a stroke. She recovered fine and didn‚Äôt have any lingering effects, thank God. At the same time I had an abnormal pap which turned out to be ok and I‚Äôve had normal ones ever since. Then in 2017 I had a lump in my breast which also turned out to be nothing serious... then 2018 hit and I took my mom to the ER because we thought she was having another stroke. She tuned out to be ok again. I had some weird inverted ear drum thing which made it hard to hear but it eventually went away. At the same time my sister moved far away and a lady at work died.. then I started getting pressure in my head and I felt dizzy from it all the time... in July 2019 I ended up going to the doctor for the head pressure thing and she said it was tension headaches... so I have been dealing with that ever since. Back in October 2019 I had gotten 2 dry red patches of skin on my legs... turns out I now have nummular eczema. It did go away after using steroid cream but I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs a chronic illness and I‚Äôll have to deal with flare ups for the rest of my life... I just don‚Äôt understand what I did so wrong to deserve all of this happening to me. It feels like God hates me and isn‚Äôt even there for me. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve become so depressed.	Christian

[m4A/a] Terrible, Dreadful Feminization	A lot of gender transformation content, be it stories, captions, or comics, end with a clean-cut ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù. The guy turns female, and while at first he might hate it, he learns to love *her* new body. Things generally end alright for her, and in many cases, she‚Äôs in a better spot than when she started. This is not one of those scenarios. Something that‚Äôs always fascinated me about transformation in general is the feeling of dread and terror in can evoke. This is primarily the case in the body horror genre, but I believe it can take place in the gender transformation niche as well. Let‚Äôs be real here, if you did start to lose shrink inch by inch, wouldn‚Äôt you be worried? When your chest began to grow flabby, and latter expand outwards into blossoming breasts, wouldn‚Äôt you be at least a tad concerned? And when your memories themselves started to slip away, and you found your formerly masculine self began dreaming about lip gloss and dresses, wouldn‚Äôt terror shoot up your spine? In short, I‚Äôm interested about exploring how horrifying it‚Äôd be to go from a perfectly masculine guy into a giggly girly girl. Ideally, the transformation should be slow and drawn out; all the more time to appreciate the impending doom. If you‚Äôre interested in this sort of transformation, hit me up.

[Support] Is there any way to make the fans run at full speed during gaming?	Played Doom 2016 on my Surface, it gave good 60fps on very low but the surface heats up in 5 minutes and slows down the processor and then the fan finally runs. This heat causes the surface to cap games at 20-10 fps making them unplayable. But what if we make the fans run at max during gaming? I tried to search, but haven't found any options to make the laptop do this. Playing games at 15 fps every 5 minutes is pretty annoying. Soo please, any help would be appreciated	SurfaceGaming
Special events shouldn't count towards your overall stats and badges	Currently on the battle armor event is really easy to get your 4k damage badge, just wait for the day with level 4 or Evo armor and you will do more that 4k damage in a single game. The same happened during the Halloween event, everyone was getting their 20 kills badge because it was really easy to kill 20 shadows in a game. Respawn eventually fixed it but plenty of people got the badge. This is also bad for the overall stats, the events really mess the stats up. It would be nice if the events do NOT count towards the stats and badges so people don't cheese to get them.	apexlegends

Betting post flop with draws	Been playing a lot of $3.50 SNGs on Pokerstars. Find myself in these situations a lot and typically they get folded out (SNGs have been surprisingly nitty recently). &#x200B; 9 man SNG table, early/mid game, stacks are pretty even \*\* HOLE CARDS \*\*\* Dealt to RyeDale \[7c Qc\] UTG: calls BB HJ: calls BB Hero (CO): calls BB \*\*\* FLOP \*\*\* \[8s 6c 9c\] UTG: checks HJ: checks Hero: bets 1/2 pot UTG: folds HJ: folds &#x200B; I feel like a 1/2 pot bet on the flop signals that I've got either a 7 or XcXc and looking for an out on the turn OR I've found a pair which is also realistic given the pre flop betting and the board. My main question is should I be checking on the flop with 15(?) outs through flush + straight draws in a SNG setting and no raises? If betting is the right call here, is my sizing ok?	poker
A word to signify '5 aspects'??	Hi All I am setting up a business and need some help with names for it.

Opinion - All of the Insidious movies are good	Not saying this is unpopular, just my opinion after watching The Last Key today. Some of the movies are better than others, and there are definitely things I think each one could have done better, but none of them fall completely flat or aren't worth seeing if you enjoy any of them. Have to say I was pretty impressed that we got 3 sequels that were just as worthwile. If you like any of them, or are a fan of this brand of 2010s horror, there's four movies worth adding to your list.	horror

He was an old boy and super sweet. He wasn‚Äôt doing so well this morning, so we made a vet appointment. He passed while I was cuddling with him. My roommate was showering and we didn‚Äôt want the cat to be alone, so I stayed. He was looking right at me when he left. I‚Äôm really sad. My roommate is worse. This sucks I feel bad because I told my roommate to get ready. If I hadn‚Äôt, he would‚Äôve been with his friend when it happened. I know that‚Äôs ridiculous to think, but the thought is there.

So the Raiju‚Äôs Harness exotic Hunter chest piece got some interesting lore . . . are these new characters or de we know any more about the people involved.	Link to the lore entry: https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/raijus-harness So Raiju is, in real life, a Japanese mythological creature, being described as a white and blue wolf embodying the storm. In the Raiju‚Äôs Harness lore tab, Tohr is, presumably, a powerful Arcstrider. His corpse lies on a ‚Äústorm shrouded hill‚Äù and above it is ‚ÄúRaiju‚Äôs Maelstrom‚Äù (I do not know what this is, other than it being described as something akin to a very, very powerful source of Arc energy/storm). Tyv Lucine, whom we know very little about other than the fact that she too is an Arcstrider, works her way across the ravaged landscape to reach Tohr‚Äôs corpse. By his side is a staff, and on his chest lies the exotic in question, described as only ‚ÄúThe Harness‚Äù in the lore entry. She dons the Harness and pledges to ‚Äúlive as lightning made flesh‚Äù. I found this a very interesting and entertaining lore piece and I was wondering if we had any background on any of the things mentioned in this entry? I haven‚Äôt found any lore background on Tohr, Tyv Lucine, or the Raiju‚Äôs Maelstrom. Can anybody provide further information on these?	DestinyLore

Water temp too high in DWC?	"Ever since I switched to QB my water temps can rise to 24**¬∞**C . I've been dropping frozen bottles in one plant and leaving the other, the plant that I'm not touching seems to be healthier by a fair amount. I'm thinking that the temps rising and falling so frequently is actually worse than the hotter temps. &#x200B; My question is, should I just leave the res temps and hope for no algae? &#x200B; I'm planning on getting a water chiller eventually instead of temporary fixes.

Just discovered TMA and I. Am. Hooked!	Good Lord! I don‚Äôt understand how I didn‚Äôt find this show earlier. It‚Äôs everything I want out of a bingeable show. Every story is incredibly well-written with just the kind of surreal, cosmic body horror that gets under my skin. The meta-story, while it‚Äôs only just ramping up, is incredibly engaging. I wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd feel about other voices besides Jonathan‚Äôs coming into the fold, but I like Martin so far. I‚Äôve been listening to this show literally from morning till night. I haven‚Äôt been this sucked into a show since I discovered Twin Peaks on Netflix last year.

Would you want private lobby warzone missions?	By this I mean, say you only have 1 buddy to play with and you don‚Äôt want to be put in a warzone with 2 other random people. You would go into a private warzone mission instead of a public one, and that would put you in a warzone with just you and you‚Äôre buddy, nobody else. This leads to my next question, would you want the rest of your squad to be AI‚Äôs or just not there at all? Options to fill the squad with AI or not would be awesome because options are always great to have, but if I had to choose I‚Äôd say no AI. I bring this up because I‚Äôd personally love to do co-op warzones, and it‚Äôd be a nice challenge to take on a warzone with only 2 avengers. Using an iconic duo to play with like cap and widow, or Thor and hulk just seems fun and would force a lot more teamwork and synergy between characters that compliment each other‚Äôs skills.

New smartphones should be released every three years instead of every year.	Seriously though! A lot of these smartphone companies tout to consumers that their product lifespan is three years. Why would you say that and release another phone about a year later. This many smartphones coming out every year can't be good for the environment, plus smartphone sales are declining. Look at Samsung that sold more units last year than this year. There are extenuating circumstances I'll admit. But it can't be good for the environment to have them keep coming every year.	unpopularopinion

TIFU by buying super tampons	For background, I Always buy the same brand of Kotex U light tampons. Never had any issues. All was always well. And for TMI details, my period was finishing off, so lighter than usual but not quite finished. So yesterday I go to pee and realize I‚Äôm out of tampons. So I rush over to the store and buy the same package that I always buy, or so I thought. I open up the package and all of the tampons are in green wrappers, rather than the usual pink, blue and purple. ‚ÄúOdd‚Äù I think, but don‚Äôt bother to read the package. So I stand up, go to insert the tampon, and it felt like it stabbed me. (I didn‚Äôt get it in) ‚ÄúOW!‚Äù I scream. My boyfriend runs over and asked what is wrong. I told him that my tampon hurt me, he said that was weird and to try it again. So I guide the tampon in gently, and everything is fine. Or so I thought. I sit down on the couch and I can FEEL the tampon inside of me. It HURTS and is very uncomfortable. (You typically DONT really notice the tampon inside you) So now I‚Äôm thinking, WTF. I go and look at the package of tampons. There plastered on the front is the word ‚ÄúSUPER‚Äù fuck. I super fucked up, I never use super, and ESPECIALLY not when my period is barely there. So I go into the bathroom to take it out because I‚Äôm so uncomfortable and.... I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs stuck and it hurts like an absolute bitch. I run out into the living room with my pants around my ankles and a look of horror on my face. My boyfriend asks what‚Äôs wrong and I tell him I have a bloody super tampon stuck in me that hurts to take out. (Pun intended) So there I am in the living room trying to gently remove this tampon. Each little pull of movement BURNS in my vagina. It hurts SO BAD. My boyfriend tries to help and keeps asking if I want him to ‚Äújust pull it out.‚Äù ‚ÄúNO‚Äù I scream. After entirely way too long, I finally remove it from myself. And now the inside of my vagina feels like it has carpet burn. Joy. TL;DR - bought super tampons and one got stuck inside of me and now my vagina hurts	tifu
Would a lot of ranked problems be solved by removing the ability to duo-queue?	I do appreciate the ability to be able to climb ranked with someone else, and I think at it's core the mechanic does have a lot of benefits, but I do not think that this is outweighed by all the potentials for abuse. As someone who primarily queues alone, there is an extreme feeling that you have no agency when you're queued up against a Taric/Yi funneling duo, a duo queue where one duo member is a fresh level 30 with 100% win rate and is obviously boosting the other, or where there are two sets of duo queues on the opposing team. What do you think?	leagueoflegends

Minimalist combat boot?	Hey everybody, I was wondering if anybody knows of a minimalist combat boot? Most usually have a pretty hefty arch or higher heel in my experience. The best Ive found are a pair of Rockys which are relatively flat but have heavily padded soles. These are for garrison use by the way. Looking for coyote brown or tan or even black! Thanks!

Additive vs. Subtractive EQ	Just wondering, in the case of either getting an IEM that has more bass and reducing it via EQ, or getting an IEM that has less bass an increasing it via EQ, are either of these the more favourable option sonically? Is there any downside of one vs. the other? Would be using an ES100 for the basic EQ'ing if it's relevant.	headphones
Smoking weed after acid trip gave me a panic attack	me and my girlfriend decided to take acid together during the night to continue in and go to the back the morning after, where we drank a bit of alcohol and got home after a long ass day of soaking rays, no sleep and no food, we decided to smoke before we ate, so the food would go down better. in retrospect, it wasn't wise to drop si many substances in such short time, but anyways, shortly after, I started to believe i was acting out of my control and started having anxiety that the acid might have given me a mental illness in conjuction with the weed, which for some reason, I also believed was mixed with some type of toxic chemical. With all the stressful thoughts flooding my head, I started to shake in fear for the first time in my life as I explained this ridiculous experience to my friends which then told me what I was going through, which I had no idea was said panic attack. The morning after, I still hold some type of fear within me that quite uncomfortable .	LSD

<$1500 USD Laptop for Engineering Student	Hey all, This fall I will be starting school and majoring in engineering so I need a new laptop that can handle fairly gpu/cpu intensive CAD programs. Build quality and reliability are very important to me, as is a relatively compact size. I found on newegg this MSI p65 for $1200 USD and it seems to check all the boxes though I don‚Äôt know much about MSI‚Äôs long term reliability. https://www.newegg.com/space-gray-with-silver-diamond-cut-msi-p65-creator-9sd-1656-gaming-entertainment/p/N82E16834155442 I am also open to suggestions for other laptops that would fit the bill, so I‚Äôve filled out the form below. **LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE** * **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** $1500 MAX, preferably around $1200-1300 * **Are you open to refurbs/used?** refurbished is ok, not used * **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Performance, Battery, Form Factor, Build quality * **How important is weight and thinness to you?** not very, though as small in size as possible * **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 13-15 inch, though I prefer 14 or less * **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** CAD Programs- Solidworks and similar * **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** Only light gaming, maybe COD war zone on medium settings * **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Reliable build quality for sure. I want it to last all through college. 500 gb SSD at the minimum. * **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Reliability is key for me, though I am probably going to get an extended warranty for peace of mind.

The Evolution of the First Vision from spiritual vision to physical event.	I was reading a wiki article about the origins of the resurrection story of Christ and how it made its way into the New Testament. There is a historical consensus among non-theist scholars that the resurrection story began as very real visionary claims by the main believers in Christ. We have enough historical evidence that suggests Peter was the first disciple of Christ to receive a visionary manifestation where he saw a vision of the resurrected Christ. Mary Magdalene and several of the other apostles also have sufficient evidence for their own visionary experiences as well. Most scholars agree their experiences were much more similar to Paul‚Äôs then what is currently recorded in the New Testament. So what happened? The consensus is that these witnesses evolved over time until the New Testament gospels were written down in the form we know them today between 70-110 A.D. The first instances of these recordings were actually in the writings of Paul which were written about 20 years before the gospel of Mark which served as the template for the other gospels. In just 40 or so years the visionary experiences of the apostles evolved into the physical manifestations we read about today. A similar occurrence happened with the first vision. In every account we have of the first vision one thing is unanimous: the first vision was a spiritual vision, not a physical manifestation. There are even specific phrases in the 1832, 1838, and 1842 accounts that describe Joseph Smith awakening or coming to his natural senses after the vision had been received. The belief in the first vision as a physical manifestation is one that is uniquely tradition, taught by modern church leaders to be as real and tangible as the resurrection of Christ in the New Testament. Tracing where this teaching began is difficult and sparse, especially with the evidence we have that it was not even widely taught as a foundational experience of our faith until atleast the early 20th century. The reason for this evolution of belief is as obvious as the evolution of Christ‚Äôs resurrection: it adds legitimacy and a determined realism to the event, in a way that is definitely not shared by a spiritual vision. It‚Äôs incredibly interesting to me that this same physical legitimacy evolved in both the early Christian church and early Mormonism. Without it, it definitely makes the whole story seem a lot less real.	exmormon
it‚Äôs been 8 weeks and i‚Äôve received exactly $0 from unemployment	i‚Äôve called hundreds of times, i‚Äôve faxed in my application, i‚Äôve gone online. people who i knew before who were bumming cigarettes and money for four lokos are now buying switches that they get bored with after a month and seeking out diamond jewelry on facebook. i‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre undeserving, but they‚Äôre being so irresponsible and flaunting it. i couldn‚Äôt pay my half of the rent in may and even though my fianc√© is still working, we probably won‚Äôt make June (maybe, if his stimulus check comes in time because i can‚Äôt get ahold of former employers re: my w2s). he‚Äôs making less than these people who used to do the bare minimum to scrape by. snap benefits have been a small help, but i‚Äôm just really disheartened. life isn‚Äôt fair but i‚Äôve worked really hard to be where i‚Äôm at. i know things can‚Äôt return to normal for a long time but i really hope they open just enough not to ruin everything, both for myself and others.

Mother's Day reminder why respect is conditional on belief	"Yesterday while face-timing my mom for Mother's Day, she made a not-so-subtle remark about why me and my wife haven't had children yet. (We've been married for 6 years, and are planning on having children someday, but we both were really young when we got married, so are honestly in no rush.) After she made her remark, that basically blamed me for dragging my feet about children, she immediately countered with ""just joking, I know that having children is personal and just between you two and the Lord."" I have a fairly blunt relationship with her, so I called her out, saying that she was only joking because my response wasn't what she wanted to see. To which she agreed and that I had caught her (lol). She then started talking about babies and children and how it never gets easier to have them, and she knew someone who waited 7 years, and it was even harder for them because life ""got in the way."" And then she started passive aggressively saying that she knows that she can't tell me what to do, because once I'm told what to do, I always do the opposite. This got me thinking. I am an educated person. Got good grades, have worked hard, got a bachelor's degree, and am now in the process of getting my doctorate in medicine. My wife, incredibly bright and intelligent. Graduated college in 3 years and then completed her Master's degree before many people her same age had even finished their bachelors. Yet to my mom, I will always be the dumb teenager, stubborn child, too-independent-for-my-own good toddler. I am not the smartest of her children, (as I have some really genius siblings) therefore I will *never* know as much as them. My wife and I, have not told any family about stepping away from the church, so they all think we believe. This conversation really affected me because I know that when we finally do tell family, (which honestly will probably be when we have children and have to tell them we will not be blessing them,) I will no longer be the ""smart doctor"" that my mom loves telling her friends about. I will instantly become the stubborn child who ""isn't as smart as his other siblings, who still believe, so he has clearly been lead astray."" I know this is probably my own inferiority complex, but it still hurts. My mom has made it clear throughout my life that there is nothing I can do that will make her stop loving (which is really amazing that she set that standard since I was a child.) But while she may not stop loving me, based on past experience she will stop respecting me, which hurts almost as much."	exmormon
[PA/NY] Adopted out biological child has severe special needs, adoptive parents pushing us to help.	"My now husband and I legally gave our first child up for adoption 10 years ago to some relatives. We now are married and have a child together. Our biological child has severe autism. He is nonverbal and cannot be toilet trained, among other things. The adoptive parents obviously know who we are because we are distant relatives. This was supposed to be a semi-open adoption, but we have only seen this child twice at family functions since his birth. Since December, they've started sending out messages and phone calls that make it clear that they believe this is somehow different than a normal adoption. They now want us to assume custody and care of our first child. The only written proof we have is a few texts saying that we need to ""take responsibility"" and that I ""need to contribute more than I might have thought"" because the child isn't normal. They've insinuated on calls that he may need to come live with us soon enough. We can't afford the care this child needs, and he was legally adopted by these people at birth. What is our obligation here? We've stopped responding at all out of fear of creating an agreement or expectation, and we don't have money to just donate anyway."	legaladvice

Can Symkevi cause anxiety/depression? (M20)	I started taking Symkevi a few weeks ago, I‚Äôm on 1 twice a week and I feel it‚Äôs made my anxiety, depression, and overall motivation worse. I‚Äôve had mental issues like these for years and got therapy which helped a bit but they feel amplified since I‚Äôve been on Symkevi but it could just be a coincidence, I don‚Äôt know. Also unrelated slightly but I used to have a pretty high libido and now I hardly ever feel like doing anything sexual, I even struggle to get erections and if I do I lose them pretty fast. I was going to make an appointment with the doctors but they are only phone appointments because of Coronavirus. I have a clinic appointment in a couple of weeks with my CF team but I feel to embarrassed to bring it up with them as I see them regularly, I‚Äôd rather see a doctor about it who I won‚Äôt know for the rest of my life.

My father constantly controlls my life and life choices	"I'm male 17 and my father constantly controlls my life choices like what high school should I go to,what job would i work and I really can't go on like this.It destroys every ounce of respect I have for him.2 years ago when I had to choose what High School I should go to he made me go to a school I didn't want or like (car electrician),I said 2 other schools I wanted to go to but he wouldn't even listen he litteraly dragged me to go to that school,and when my mother says that he made me go to that school he gets offended and defensive saying that we are lying.But this thing happened today.I always loved learning languages and I already know a few languages (my native,English,German,a fair bit of Russian) and about a week ago I started learning Japanese (because since I can remember I always loved Japan and I always wanted to travel there and hopefully live there one day) and he called me on the phone and asked what am I doing,so I said learning Japanese for the next 30 minutes he was lecturing me how much useless I am,how I will never accomplish anything in my life,how retarded I am because I am learning that amount of Languages and when he finished his lecturing he said ""I don't care it's your life you are gonna destroy not mine"" and hanged up.That destroyed me,that litteraly destroyed me.I don't know what to do,I was thinking of running away from home but I don't have anywhere else to go.I need some help."	helpme

Ansiedade, Ex e Alucina√ß√£o	Em resumo, namoramos por uns 10 anos, terminamos a cerca de um ano pq comecei a fumar maconha depois que vi que ajudava com minha ansiedade. Ela acreditava que eu iria vender as coisas do ap e me tornar um drogado. Ap√≥s o termino me mudei de ap e n√£o nos vimos mais, mantive contato com a fam√≠lia a qual nunca achei que me curtissem muito mas pelo visto eu estava enganado. Ela aparentemente superou e entrou em outro relacionamento, eu ainda to me acostumando a voltar a sair e conhecer galera (ansiedade me faz ficar retardado at√© me sentir confort√°vel com pessoas novas), a algumas semanas consegui pela primeira vez chegar em alguma mina aleat√≥ria sem surtar, (isso me deixou puta empolgado). Agora o que ta me fudendo a cabe√ßa √© que ontem, me vem uma mensagem aleat√≥ria no Instagram justamente DELA, mais de ano depois. Sei l√°, fiquei sem entender a situa√ß√£o e para piorar n√£o dei bola para mensagem na hora, tentando evitar de ficar ansioso e abandonar oq tava fazendo na hora s√≥ para olhar a mensagem dela. Quando n√£o aguentei a ansiedade, fui olhar o celular para ver o que era a mensagem e ela j√° n√£o tava mais l√°. PQP agora to puta ansioso pensando se a mensagem era real ou se pra ajudar agora to alucinando, pelo visto ta na hora de voltar a psicologa. Edit TL;Dl - Terminamos, n√£o sei se a mensagem que recebi foi real ou apenas novos sintomas de transtorno psicol√≥gico.	desabafos

Anything similar to Gamma World 7e/Savage Rifts but easier to run in Roll20/VTTs?

Basically, that don't require custom dice or decks, or, in the case of Savage Rifts, such a slog through character creation?	rpg
What are your thoughts on where Siege is at currently?	I've been playing Siege since Operation Chimera. When I first started playing the game I was god awful, couldn't win a gunfight to save my life and didn't know how the game worked. I took some time away and just learned the game, watched YouTube vids from pros and popular channels to get an idea how the game worked. I came back to the game and fell in love with it, it's all I've played. Since that time I've been ranked Plat and hover around a 1.4 w/l and a 1.5kd and from where I came from when I started I was proud of that. Lately though, I've just felt apathetic to the game, playing it has been more of a chore than something I enjoy doing. Maybe I'm just burnt out from playing or just lost the joy of meeting up with my friends and getting a few games together each night. Just curious what everyone else's thoughts on the game and where it currently is? TL;DR: Used to love the game, don't really anymore. How do you feel about Siege?	Rainbow6

Ghost of Tsushima - Everything You Need to Know - Huge Info Dump	"Main stuff: - It‚Äôs an open-world samurai adventure. - The game is grounded and realistic. There's no supernatural elements in this game. - The game is a original work of fiction they are not rebuilding history stone by stone. - Ghost of Tsushima is huge ‚Äì the biggest game Sucker Punch has ever made by a wide margin. - You can play the game with a Japanese voice track. Even with a cast of mostly native Japanese speakers, they still have a dialogue coach for the game for authentic ancient Japanese. - No branching narrative - The game launches July 17th - The Game does have a photomode - Ghost of Tsushima Has Multiple Difficulty Settings - This isn‚Äôt going to be a UI heavy game - Swordplay and the horse is all mo-cap. - The composer of the game is Shigeru Umebayashi The Story : > In the late 13th century, the Mongol empire has laid waste to entire nations along their campaign to conquer the East. Tsushima Island is all that stands between mainland Japan and a massive Mongol invasion fleet led by the ruthless and cunning general, Khotun Khan. As the island burns in the wake of the first wave of the Mongol assault, samurai warrior Jin Sakai stands as one of the last surviving members of his clan. He is resolved to do whatever it takes, at any cost, to protect his people and reclaim his home. He must set aside the traditions that have shaped him as a warrior to forge a new path, the path of the Ghost, and wage an unconventional war for the freedom of Tsushima. The World : - There a lot of stories in the game that you may not find them all. - The game will feature NO waypoints - There are many side characters in the game, most which have sidequests. - Jin will learn new things from NPC quests - Each area in the game has a different theme. That reflects to different stories and narrative themes for each area. The name of the area on the demo is ""The forest of no return"". Features betrayal stories with darker tone - You will roam vast countrysides, explore billowing fields, and tranquil shrines to ancient forests, villages and stark mountainscapes,bamboo forests to the urban center of ornate castles - They want to give players alot of navigational options ,we seeing horse riding, parkour and Jin swinging with the grappling hook so far - Dynamic time of day and weather , we seeing snow, and rain areas so far - Simulated clouds. All dynamic, not painted, never going to be seen twice - Procedural skies and procedural sun break tech - If you roll around a lot in the mud you will be completely cover. If it starts raining it washes away all the mud and blood - ‚ÄúMovement‚Äù is the environment theme, expect everything to move - blowing trees, windy fields, falling leaves - If you see something and you expect to be able to climb on it, then we want you to be able to climb on it - The trailer with Masako from E3 was a side mission - Jin will change what he is wearing. In a rain-drenched part of the world Jin has traded his traditional armor for a straw raincoat called a mino. This has both mechanical value and narrative value. Combat : - The theme of the combat is ‚Äúmud, blood, and steel‚Äù. They want a feeling of intensity and danger in the combat‚Äã - Combat system can scale all the way up from a one-on-one combat with a worthy opponent all the way up to dealing with a horde of Mongols - Master the bow to eliminate distant threats with lethal precision - Develop stealth and deception tactics to disorient and ambush enemies with surprise attacks - An adaptive landscape and organic approach to combat makes Tsushima the perfect playground for mixing and matching skills, weapons, and tactics to find the perfect combat blend for your play style - As Jin‚Äôs story unfolds, versatility and creativity will become your greatest weapons. - You can customize your katana - They want every swing to feel real, so every hit that connects leave a scar. - There is a progression system. Jin has learned to use a grapple hook but this is not part of his samurai training. He‚Äôs had to learn new tricks to silently kill the Mongols - Duels in the game is going to be very narrative base they want to build the tension, each duel will be around some unique element like the red tree - The square button will swing your sword - You can kill an enemy with a single strike from the blade if you hold the triangle button and release it at the right moment - You parry with L1 - You can clean your blade with a button - Œ§he chain assassinations we seen in the trailer you must hit the button at the right time to go to the next one there is a time period - Assassinations are one of the tactics you can use. There‚Äôs a fear factor here. If you do successfully assassinate someone then it stuns the other enemies around you and gives you an opportunity to perform follow-up attacks - You can perform horseback assassinations - Weapons we seen so far, swords,bows, stun/flash bombs and big possibility of more - Where Jin stabs someone though a screen is call the Shoji assassination.

MAGA (make Amagi great again)	Amagi got nerfed too hard. It was a great ship that took some knowledge to play well. Had her on the back burner for a long time and decided to play her today. Awful, horrible. It was bad after the initial nerf, but the current state of play is especially bad for this ship. Long range HE spam really eats her up. The armor isn‚Äôt good, the guns despite being 410s are not good, speed and handling very mediocre. Was my first T7 BB. Thinking im gonna sell her though, can‚Äôt see any reason to play her over an Iowa or JB.	WoWs_Legends

For the love of god, use the wingman.	It doesn‚Äôt matter how good you think you are or how long it‚Äôll take you, the wingman is the most OP gun in the game capable of killing a red-shield enemy in 4-5 hits to the chest. What‚Äôs more it‚Äôs way more consistent than the peacekeeper. If you‚Äôre off by the slightest amount with a peacekeeper you get an 11 damage shot, the wingman fires 1 bullet that if it hits deals 45 damage, even more if it‚Äôs a headshot. AND it‚Äôs bullets slow you down. The only reason the wingman hasn‚Äôt been nerfed to oblivion is because all the people who are good at using it are the ones insisting it‚Äôs not over powered. You have no excuses not to use it, use the wingman. No matter how long it takes you to get good with it.	apexuniversity
How to make any amiibo with only an android phone	"Hey everyone! I realized that still a lot of people don't know about this, so I wanted to inform everyone that the following is the easiest way to get your dream villager. Just a reminder that the new villager like Raymond, etc. aren't able to get with this because there aren't any amiibos of them (for now). This method definitely works, I use it everyday to invite my dream villagers to my campsite! That's how I got Ankha, Stitches and other of my dreamies! You only need 2 apps from the appstore: ""Joycondroid App"" and the ""Google Files App"". I'm sadly very bad at explaining stuff, so I just tell you which tutorial I followed. It's by the account ""crossingers"" on Instagram and they have it as a story saved! It may look difficult first but trust me even I was able to do it because it's step by step and you can always rewatch it! Reminder not every android phone works as far as I now but most Samsung phones definitely work! So pls don't pay people insane amounts of bells, NMT or even real word money for villagers! I hope that some maybe get their dreamies with this method! Everybody have a great week and stay healthy!"	AnimalCrossing
Steps to take while waiting	I've been lurking in this community for a couple years now and thinking about weight loss surgery for way longer than that. Today, I finally submitted my first consultation request. I'll be self-pay. I'm hoping to schedule my surgery sometime in late summer/early fall, when hopefully COVID will be less of a concern. Right now I'm going to start phasing out soda (I'm a Diet Coke addict) and sampling all the protein shakes. Are there any other steps y'all would recommend for someone a few months away from surgery, or things you wish you'd done before surgery?	gastricsleeve

How do you keep your circulation going when in the operating room?	Hi everyone. I'm new to Reddit and I hope I'm doing this right. I'm a med student in Germany and have recently had my first surgery experiences in orthopaedics. The surgeons let me stand in the sterile area and sometimes even assist and I found it incredibly interesting. I could honestly imagine to work in this field in a few years. I just had one problem: dizziness, sometimes even syncopation. It didn't matter that much because I wasn't needed, but it shouldn't happen on a regular basis when you're a surgeon... So now I wonder if it is at all possible for me to enter a surgical field, or if I should rather pursue a career that doesn't involve operating... Do you have any general advice, experiences or opinions on this? Anything will be much appreciated, because I'm genuinely confused about what I could or should do in the next few years to come.	medizzy

[Idea] I think you would all enjoy working...	**...if it wasn't so kafkaesque**. It took me a while of practical thought to get here, but I'm logically here with my train of thought. Instinctively humans love to feel resourceful, as it is a trait carried to us from our neanderthal forefathers. However given the state of affairs that exist today (between wealth inequity and the lack of communal presence related to one‚Äôs job), we have a big portion of the population (myself included) who are anti-work. However, we still have people that enjoy playing games like ‚ÄúThe SIMS‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnimal Crossing,‚Äù we have people that love slice of life shows, such as ‚Äú[The Devil is a Part Timer](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama),‚Äù a big portion of the population who are anti-work, also enjoy the idea of work from afar. But why? I recently watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhD2rmhcBFM) video discussing a theory about ‚ÄúAnimal Crossing‚Äù. In summary, the main character is dead and you are in purgatory. The theory is is partly evidenced through the ideas that life within Animal Crossing is very simple. Work is simple, bills are simple, owning a home is simple; and life within Animal Crossing is simple because it is viewed through the objective lens of a [deceased?] child. Kafka poses that through excessive bureaucratic burdens, people are left confused in paperwork. We don‚Äôt know what's going to happen next, nor where to turn [/u/blom95], and we are stuck in this jungle of complex ideas with little ideological substance. Gone are the simpler days of working communally: as the towns blacksmith, or the state‚Äôs [teacher](https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/). Instead, are the days of working as someone‚Äôs *senior insurance claims adjuster*, woo! The aforementioned ideas parallel and describe the anti-work situation today. Work no longer provides the working individual **meaning** in their pursuits (not true for all careers, but true for most). Work is no longer a simple lifestyle, but at best, complicated. The population of anti-work is not a lazy population, but rather those who desire a simpler life.

Question about credit cards	I‚Äôm finally getting to the point where I‚Äôm almost out of debt. I have one CC through my bank (with $0 balance) and one CC that I use for recurring monthly payments (and pay off every month). The latter earns me 1% cash back for each purchase but has a $39 annual fee. I was researching other cards and rewards programs with no annual fee. Now that I‚Äôm in a much better place financially, my credit score is higher and I can probably qualify for a better CC. Anyway, the question is this: Is it better to just pay for everything in cash (debit card) or are some of these credit card rewards programs actually worth it? I was kind of interested in the ones that earn airline miles and have no annual fee. I wouldn‚Äôt be putting more than $200 on the card monthly and would pay it off each month.	debtfree

Hey, quick PSA: We're still in Stage 2 of reopening. We haven't magically moved to Stage 5 yet.	Sick of seeing so many people out and about, back on with their normal lives. As if we all got bored of COVID so decided it was over. The lifting is based on the hospital's ability to handle the virus through beds and ventilators, not based on the virus being somehow eradicated in our state. You could still get it. Your chances are still high. The difference is that you'll have a hospital bed to die in versus being turned away due to capacity. Here's a handy guide.

How do you know if an activity is productive or a waste of time?	So for quarantine I tried to catch up on watching documentaries on Netflix. I thought it was really productive at first but then I realized I might be wasting my time because I've been binging them. I now moved to reading history and philosophy books. Again, been really productive at first, but I don't know at what number of finished books would I start calling it a waste of time because I've been spending my whole day reading. I realized if I spend a hundred hours reading German history, I wouldn't practically use them in any way in my life. What makes it any different from sleeping all day, watching reality shows or playing video games? Same thing with learning languages. I've been casually studying Korean and Russian since 2 years ago, spent a lot of hours, yet I'm in no way planning on living in those countries anytime in the future. I always thought I'm being productive by learning about anything but I can't help but think there's no practical use to all of this.	productivity

Anyone else feel like the game rewards disrespect?	When I say disrespect I mean mashing buttons (especially uppercut) after being negative. I feel like it's part of the meta, and works more than it should. However, (tired of saying it) there are some characters blessed with 9 frame mids, and you don't dare disrespect a character who has one. I believe it creates a big imbalance with the game, forcing characters without fast mid hitting strings to work a lot harder to win, whether as characters like Liu Kang cannot be disrespected, and in turn have a lot more control over their opponent. In a sense, there is no such THING as having a turn in this game, it's just mash fest sometimes, and your opponent has an advantage if your character doesn't have a fast, mid hitting string. Please tell me what you think, I've been trying to understand what it is I don't like about this game and this is the theory i'm leaning towards.	MortalKombat

Are evictions a thing yet?	I remembered reading that the evictions moratorium expired at the end of April and I did some digging through old news articles which confirmed that the evictions moratorium ended April 26th. Does anyone know if that got extended? Are evictions only being held up by the fact that courts are closed right now? I think the CARES act bans evictions on certain properties through June (estimated to effect about 25% of renters who have federally backed rental agreements or whose landlords used certain federal programs).	rva

You Have No Idea What Impact Your Writing Is Having	I don‚Äôt know if this post *belongs* here or not, but I really thought it was something worth sharing with the folks here. I‚Äôm a former book editor (now full-time freelancer). I worked for a small trade publisher in suburban Chicago. We had some ‚Äúhits,‚Äù but most of our books most people wouldn‚Äôt know. Anyway, lately I‚Äôve been feeling nostalgic and I looked up some of the authors I worked with in the past, just to see what they were up to these days. And I looked up an author who had pitched me several fantasy novels that I really really liked but could not convince my boss to buy. Her writing captivated me. To the point that I called her up every now and then to see if she was working on anything new, anything that might work better for our list. She lived out in the woods, in a trailer (I think), but she always told me about all of the injured/stray animals she was taking in. She was just scraping by with odd writing jobs, teaching and speaking at fantasy-writing conferences. She sold a *Star Trek: Next Generation* novel and a couple of fantasies to a paperback publisher. But despite my efforts, we were never able to come up with something new that would work for my employer. Her name was Rebecca Neason. And I just learned that she died several years ago, after dealing with a chronic illness. As far as I can tell, she never published the book she‚Äôd submitted to me, the book she was so passionate about. I don‚Äôt think she published anything beyond the books I was already familiar with, books that are on my shelves even now. And I feel unusually emotional about the fact that she is no longer in the world. Who she was as a writer, a person, made a powerful impression on me that I am not going to forget. It‚Äôs easy to think that editors and agents are faceless beings who exist only to say no or to impede our dreams. As writers, it‚Äôs easy to assume that we‚Äôre just names on a manuscript. But I‚Äôm convinced that if we take the time to put a bit of who we are into what we write‚Äîwhatever that might be‚Äîit is going to resonate with readers. Maybe it will sell; maybe it won‚Äôt. But maybe it will open the door to something else, something unexpected and even life changing.	writing
I messed up my settings... lapses now at 6 days?	"So I wasn't happy with my settings and decided to mess around with them. I decided to use Anking's settings and I took off my load balancer. Now, all of my cards that I've missed have the ""good"" interval of 6 days and an ""easy"" interval of anywhere from 1 - 6 days, which confuses the hell out of me. I would want the cards I clicked ""again"" on to show up the next day and then if I get them right, bump them to their around their normal spacing. For example, a card that I get wrong that was originally 6months, now will be like 1.4 months or something. &#x200B; &#x200B; [What is happening?!?](https://preview.redd.it/r63lnrnvg5y41.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=47e5f0f563d78617e76a0f6d9c889c8cf146a4a7) &#x200B; Does this make any sense?

Actual Size of PS5's SSD	"Let's start with some facts beforehand: * 1 TB or (1,000,000,000,000 Bytes) is advertised as so, but its capacity is reported as 930 GiB. We'll simply refer to this as 930 GB from hereon * Similarly, 500 GB ""advertised"" is allocated as 465 GB of space * PS4's OS (Operating System and Services) [eats up around ~57 GB of space](https://www.ps4storage.com/blog/?p=23) * Let's assume, PS5's more advanced and more-feature-heavy (read: bloated with more default apps) OS will eat up 75 GB of space Doing the math: * 825 GB advertised SSD ~= 768 GB of space * 768 - 75 GB (PS5 OS) = **693 GB** of free remaining space. How would you feel about having only 600-something GB of space in your console in 2021? Enough space to hold a couple of games, movies, music? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments."

Anyone else having an issue with team chat on Xbox?	Lately any time I join team chat, it shows multiple other players in team chat but I hear nothing. Now usually I would say that they're just being quiet, but when I speak I don't have the icon in the top corner showing that I am saying anything. Mic isn't muted and all settings are correct.

What's your favourite repeated motif in a song?	I thought I would get sick of the four piano notes that are in almost all forty one minutes of Fishmans' Long Season but I loved to see its sound becoming warped in the second phase, disappearing for a bit in the fourth phase to make way for the violin, and making its return to contribute in the gorgeous, emotional finale. So, what are your favourite, best executed motifs in music?	LetsTalkMusic
Should I abandon my best friend?	My ex and I broke up a few months ago. It was somewhat mutual, really heart breaking between us, but we wanted to be friends. Before the break up I noticed my best friend and her had some sexual tension, and I told my best friend that if he were to do anything it would make things a hell of a lot harder to be friends with my ex. He said he would never do anything... Few weeks later I found out they slept together AFTER I had the conversation with him. After a lot of anger and discussion I cooled down and forgave both of them. Now we both have met this girl through a common hobby, and she's really awesome. I told my friend that I'm interested in pursuing her and would like to take lead with her. He agreed and said he'd be my wingman. But I'm starting to realize he's flirting with her, texting her constantly and once basically butted into plans I had made with her. I feel she might be more interested in him, which is fine by me, it's not my decision. But the fact my friend told me he'd back off, but clearly didn't is infuriating the hell out of me. This would be the second time he has taken priority of getting his dick wet over our 14 year friendship. Am I in the wrong for feeling so angry? I just feel I can no longer trust and feel anger towards him everytime I talk with him. I'm kind of tired of feeling this way and need to know whether I should suck it up or maybe I should take a step back.	Advice
I‚Äôm becoming so confused about my sexuality and becoming more and more convinced I‚Äôm lesbian	i came out as bi to some school friends a couple months ago and they accepted me. the other day i was laying on my bed listening to ‚Äúgirl in red‚Äù and i began thinking about my sexuality. the more i think about it, the more sex with a guy freaks me out. i am still a virgin, but i‚Äôm terrified of the thought of having sex with a guy. sex with a girl is becoming more and more appealing to me, and i‚Äôve always wanted a relationship with a girl more than a relationship with a guy. regularly, any type of sexual/romantic thoughts are always about girls, not guys. never. i‚Äôve had boy crushes as a child but i also had lots of girl crushes on various cartoon characters, so i‚Äôve just been assuming i was bi up until this point. the older i get, the less i think about guys. i still think guys are attractive sometimes, but i‚Äôm being pulled more and more towards girls. my family is homophobic, so they do not know that all of this is going on inside my head. please don‚Äôt judge me, it feels so good to write about it.	offmychest
How would you simplify Pathfinder for a bunch of total newbies?	Quarantine has hit my country and I'm currently stuck alone, having no-one else to speak to except my neighbours who would be interested to play some TTRPGs but they want to play something simple. Problem: I only have Pathfinder 1e and it's the only system I know. I'm aware it can be too complicated of a system to introduce total newbies to the hobby so I'm looking for ways to streamline the game accordingly. What rules should I ignore? What should I change to make it easier to learn? Extra infos: I only have the core rulebooks.	Pathfinder_RPG

Did Forest Gump Play Disc Golf?	I watched Forest Gump again last night from start to finish. In the opening scene of he tucks the feather into a book (Curious George?) in his suitcase. In the top of the suitcase, held in place by the net, looks to be a golf disc? A driver at that. I can't imagine why. Unless Hanks or the props guy is a disc fan and was slipping in a personal bit. The thing is flat and round. There's a tube of toothpaste next to it, but I can't think of an item of personal hygiene that would look like that. I'm pretty certain Savannah didn't have a disc golf course at the time the movie took place. (We used to play in a town park.) Edit: Of course it's the paddle. After disc popped in my head, it didn't leave room for anything else.	movies

My opinion of the Ryzen 4000 series and B450 drama.	i'll probably get downvoted but here it goes! The decision was stupid but has some upsides to it. Zen 3 is gonna be awesome and B550 motherboards will be good aswell. But the part that actually pisses me off about the whole situation is that if you want to upgrade from any AM4 CPU, you gotta pay atleast an extra $100 USD to get a good motherboard. And the CPUs will be more expensive than last gen (obviously) making you spend between $400-600 for an upgrade. This is stupid. This is just AMD doing an Intel and trying to squeeze as much money as possible. The B550 motherboard is gonna be around the same price as the B450 and maybe even last up until 2 or three more generations Ryzen Processors. But who is seriously gonna upgrade from 3rd to 4th gen immediately, You are most likely upgrading to it if you are upgrading from 2nd Ryzen CPUs and below. Zen 2 is already awesome so why waste money and wait for prices to go down. It is unneeded. The 3rd gen of Ryzen is fantastic and I will imagine people will keep on buying Processors like the 3600 and 3700x for a while. The 3600 alone is just fantastic, personally I don't own one but my good friend does and when it's paired with an RTX 2000's series or a Navi GPU, it run's so good. 3rd gen owners and B450 owners, especially 3600 owners, please just upgrade to a better CPU within the Zen 2. architecture. I can only see processors being bought by people who are making a brand new pc or upgrading from old hardware. The better part about this is the 3000 series CPUs will go down in price and maybe even B450 motherboards which is fantastic. I disagree with AMD here but just look on the bright side of things guys.

Quarantine has been PRODUCTIVE! 4 WORKS ON WATTPAD	For over 20 years I've written works without compiling them into one place.During quarantine I've put my written works together and have now 4 works (2 complete) going on Wattpad with new works being updated DAILY as I still have tons to go through. My writing goal has always been working within my own created Universe. My writing revolves around dark fantasy and neo-noir elements that I have molded into a world that highlights the struggles between the Fallen and Divine. I am also lucky to have the very talented Vanessa Trueba [https://www.instagram.com/nessa\_ninona/](https://www.instagram.com/nessa_ninona/) lending her talents for my Revelations series with chapters from Book III finally being uploaded after a 7 year hiatus.

Halfords said their rear dashcam doubles up as a reversing camera. It does not. What can I do?	I am fucking livid. I went to Halfords and asked them to install a stereo, and asked for them to install a rear dashcam that can be used as a reversing camera too. They said the [HDC 400](https://www.halfords.com/technology/dash-cams/halfords-hdc400-dash-cam-535333.html) + [HDC-R](https://www.halfords.com/technology/dash-cams/halfords-hdc-r-rear-dash-cam-535341.html) was a great option. All in all I paid like ¬£600, went to reverse and the camera didn't come on the screen. Went back to Halfords a few days later and they told me it's not a reversing camera. I am fucking livid because I've already paid for it all. Is there anything I can do? They just said it's my problem and I can buy another reversing camera and pay for installation again.	AskUK

If Pok√©mon GO launched with the features that exist today, it would have been deemed the greatest game of all time.	"When GO first came out, it was an unfathomable change. I had never imagined that a game would get everyone out into the world and exploring. To me it was literally the Pok√©mon adventure I'd dreamed of having. Pok√©mon has drifted in and out of my life since I was 5 and it's always been a standout for me, even though I am generally disinterested in other turn-based games. For me and a lot of others, I considered Pok√©mon GO as the best game I had ever played, at the time that it was released. I was so lost in the excitement of the experience that I ignored the faults and persisted through the failures. It was magical. I'll always remember jumping over golf course fences and running across greens with sprinklers on to catch a wild Dragonite at 4am. And skateboarding a km off course to catch a wild Snorlax on the way to a job interview that I was already late for. And running back and forth between gyms for 6 hours battling against spoofers just to maintain my pride. If the features that are present in the game today were available at launch, I think that Pok√©mon GO would have been even bigger and for even longer. I think this game would have been arguably crowned the GOAT. Or at least the most revolutionary game ever. Don't get me wrong, this game has a thriving playerbase with a wealth of highly entertaining content. And I still rate the experience as the single greatest gaming phenomenon that I've ever lived through. But to the general public, this game was huge at launch, was a bit light on content and fizzled out, slowly becoming a ""dead game"". What do you think? If the game was more complete back when it launched, would the hype have been enough to see Pok√©mon GO considered as the greatest game of all time?"	pokemongo
Best LI?	So the first time round I played this series (and am currently doing so) I played with Liam. He seemed like the best choice considering the first two books were the whole point MC was there. And he really cares about her. But I felt like her and drake had unfinished business. So I played second time round with him... Sometimes I feel like MC, drake and Liam are still in a triangle of sorts. MC and Liam are still treated like they are a couple, and do all the press events together, and Drake seems to be MC‚Äôs side man. Like them being together is only a thing behind closed doors. It‚Äôs weird. And then for Liam to suddenly pass on the royal line to the woman he loved whim broke his heart just seems like a really weird situation. It‚Äôs weird. ITS ALL JUST REALLY WEIRD I more like Hana as a best friend that a love interest. Tbh the story seems to flow with Liam. Who do you guys think is the best LI in general and in terms of the storyline??	Choices

Height Problem	"5'5"" , 140.8 lbs, 13.5M, mostly Mexican (like 95%), no past medical issues. Uses prescribed acne cream and otc nasal spray, exposed to second hand smoke from dad, doesn't smoke. Ok so, last year in the puberty class thing, they said that I would be going through a growth spurt for 24-36 months. I started puberty when I was 11ish and I went through a growth spurt when I was 12 that only lasted around 5 months. It brought me from 5'1"" to 5'5"", and I haven't grown since. I took one of those ""what stage of puberty am I in?"" Quizzes online and it said that I was pretty much done and should be like 5'10"". I have pubic, armpit, facial, butt, leg, arm, and bottom of chest hair. My voice is pretty deep and I'm the average penis size. My mom is 5'6"" and my dad is 5'8"". I recently put on 10 lbs in like a day, but my stature (pretty skinny) didn't change, I've also been eating slightly more than normal and have been sleeping longer by like 30 minutes, and I also have slightly long arms and legs, so these MIGHT be signs of growing talle but I don't know. So, am I done growing taller, or do I still have the rest of the growth spurt later on into my teen years?"	AskDocs

Pipe-trinket magic item?	"Hello! So I've just started my run of CoS, and thanks to you guys, it's going great! Now, at the very start, I ran the little skeleton horse encounter, and had it drop a trinket behind- the pipe that makes skull-smoke. I put it in just to increase the mystery somewhat, but one of my players got really attached to it, and keeps blowing it near any source of drama, danger, or mystery, and asking things like ""Where does the skull go?"" Now, I really do like the idea of it being a fluff- common and fairly useless magic item, so I'm allowing him, at the party's next long rest, to try to identify it. You guys are so much better at this stuff than I am, so I'm asking you; what small, but cool feature could I give this thing? NB: the party has been playing really well together, and I'd really like to throw in a smattering of little rewards to them, this isn't a case of a whiny player begging for a magic item, rather a well developed character indulging his curiosity, which I would like to reward."

I had my first ‚Äú*facepalm* It‚Äôs just a (insert object‚Äù last session.	TL;DR: one of my players got paranoid over a rock because he kept rolling high on investigation. A couple of my players like to role play making breakfast for everyone after camping so as usual they were cooking up eggs and bacon and what not and our (VERY paranoid) gunslinger asked if there was anything he could do to help. He was asked to go out and find some herbs. Easy enough. Well he rolled a nat 20 on his investigation check so I thought I‚Äôd throw in a little bit extra for him ‚ÄúYou find plenty of chives and basil and what not and you find a cool looking rock.‚Äù Figuring he would either not take it or not think anything more of it and just take it, I didn‚Äôt go into much detail. GS: ‚ÄúA cool looking rock? What does it look like?‚Äù At this point I had to pull something out of my ass and I remembered the sailor thing where rocks with a hole in it are seen as good luck. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the size of a half dollar. It‚Äôs smooth. And it has a hole in it.‚Äù GS:‚ÄùWait it has a hole in it? Was it like drilled in?‚Äù At this point I‚Äôm getting the vibe that he‚Äôs definitely reading into this way more than I was planning. So I‚Äôm gonna have some fun with this. One low investigation check later and he can‚Äôt tell if it was drilled or just looks like that. GS: ‚ÄúCan I see if there are any like, keyholes or anything that this might fit into?‚Äù Oh boy. Roll Investigation. GS: ‚ÄúNatural 20!‚Äù Thank god we were over discord or else they would‚Äôve have seen the biggest shit eating grin on my face. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt find anything that this might fit into. But you do notice that this rock looks a lot different than the other rocks in this area. It‚Äôs too smooth to really be from this area.‚Äù He then very carefully pocketed it and voiced his concern about it to me and I had to mute myself to hide my laughter.	DnD

Advice on Rebuilding Sense of Security	My husband and I have been married for 3.5 years and from the outset, chose the Venn diagram model for finances: personal accounts and then a shared one for mutual expenses. I was never a huge fan of the idea: I thought it was fine to have personal accounts but that the majority of funds should be combined. My husband felt differently. Fast to yesterday when there was a catalyst for me to bring up my discomfort with our financial arrangement. We both make good salaries‚Äîbut my husband makes more than 2.5x what I make and contributes only a little more to our shared fund, keeping most of it private. It finally came out that he has a fear that I will leave him and doesn‚Äôt want to be left with nothing. This was devastating to me‚Äîan indictment on our trust, in addition to casting a shadow of ‚Äúself-fulfilling prophecy‚Äù on our marriage. But most of all, it was confirmation that there is deep insecurity for both of us about our marriage. So my question is this: we both recognize this insecurity and want to repair it. Have you experienced this? What did you do to improve it?	Marriage

Any inside office staffers here?	I know a lot of people here are either drivers or package handlers and I know you guys are physically exhausted, I feel for you. I'm in the office - Senior Office Admin - I know a lot of stations have at least one and I am mentally exhausted. The amount of stuff going on behind the scenes is never ending - 6 days a week is running me down, or working 10 hour days to not come in on a Sat or Sun has been saving my sanity a bit. The amount of supplies, vendor issues, invoicing, interviews, onboarding, code 85s, missing packages, disputes, etc. I get home and I'm ready to pass out by 7:30pm. I just want you to know (PHs and Drivers) you're not alone. It's exhausting in many different ways for a lot of us. I hope there is a light at the end of the tunnel for a bit of a slow down, but i'm not sure when that will ever happen. I see a lot of you ask questions on here and hopefully I can help you some how, sometimes It's nice to get out of my daily routine and help others when I can. But, don't think I haven't been there, I've loaded trucks (oh Purple Carrot), acted as a jumper/helper with drivers and tried many different departments at FedEx Ground, it's draining all around.

Is Modi Government paying 85% rail fare for migrant laborers?	I am reading lots of conflicting news about the railway ticket fare for migrants workers. The BJP government [claims](https://twitter.com/sambitswaraj/status/1257156770386055170) that they are subsidizing 85 percent of the fare and states could pay the rest. While Punjab IAS officer [says](https://twitter.com/kbssidhu1961/status/1257672857015816192) that the Punjab state is paying 100% instead of 15% they were supposed to pay. Modi government has also [refused](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/modi-govt-refuses-to-tell-supreme-court-if-it-is-paying-85-rail-fare-for-migrant-labourers) to give a breakdown of ticket fares to the Supreme Court which would have cleared some air on how much is central government and state government paying. If they are not revealing the breakdown then its simply a big fat lie to gain some social points.	india
It's been just over a year and I still can't get over my ex who left me for someone else, I think I need help.	Me and my ex were together for 10 years but towards the end she became distant and started speaking with this guy from work a lot. She then left me, when she did I asked if it was because of someone else and she said no, but then one week later she was with him posting pictures everywhere and making it official. I immediately went no contact and have done since, literally haven't seen or heard anything about her, but it's been over a year now and I still can't stop thinking about her all the time, it's actually mainly the thought of them together and how she was cheating on me when I didn't even realise, there's a whole other layer to this! I really want to be able to get over this, but as I said I can't stop thinking about the betrayal, is it normal to hate someone this much but still think about them each day a year later and the good times we used to have? I've tried counselling and other methods to get help, but nothing has worked.	relationship_advice

John says he liked other Paul compositions (November 1973)	"All too often I see trashy articles claiming that the only McCartney number Lennon had any respect for was Here, There and Everywhere. In an interview with Chris Charlesworth (originally published in Melody Maker on 3rd November 1973) to promote Mind Games, Lennon's states; ""I have a favourite of Paul's... Of Paul's I like 'Here, There and Everywhere'... Of course I still like 'Eleanor Rigby', and another was 'For No One.'"" Bet this isn't even the only example. All I want is the truth."	beatles

What is the scientific evidence that caffeine withdrawal lasts longer than 7-12 days?	I see a lot of claims on here that there are effects that go on months after quitting caffeine and that they need to wait months to see the full benefits. Is there any evidence of this or is it just an assumption based on the fact that caffeine affects brain chemicals?	decaf

How to make any amiibo with only an android phone	"Hey everyone! I realized that still a lot of people don't know about this, so I wanted to inform everyone that the following is the easiest way to get your dream villager. Just a reminder that the new villager like Raymond, etc. aren't able to get with this because there aren't any amiibos of them (for now). This method definitely works, I use it everyday to invite my dream villagers to my campsite! That's how I got Ankha, Stitches and other of my dreamies! You only need 2 apps from the appstore: ""Joycondroid App"" and the ""Google Files App"". I'm sadly very bad at explaining stuff, so I just tell you which tutorial I followed. It's by the account ""crossingers"" on Instagram and they have it as a story saved! It may look difficult first but trust me even I was able to do it because it's step by step and you can always rewatch it! Reminder not every android phone works as far as I now but most Samsung phones definitely work! So pls don't pay people insane amounts of bells, NMT or even real word money for villagers! I hope that some maybe get their dreamies with this method! Everybody have a great week and stay healthy!"	AnimalCrossing
4k Watch Hours: check , 1k Subs: Uh?	Yay! I now have 4k watch hours (within last 12 months), but in terms of subscribers, I am still not halfway there.

My heart breaks seeing my stepson grieve the loss of his mom. What else can I do to help?	My SS lost his mom when he was 3 years old and he is now 7. She had been in and out while she was still here but all of his memories of her are good ones, which is good. With yesterday being Mother's day, naturally it stirred up some feelings in him. I've never seen him break down about anything like he did last night saying he missed his mom. My husband consoled him and let him know she's always with him and she's so proud of him and things of that nature. He perked back up for a little bit but then at the dinner table he just couldn't hold it together anymore. We were all in tears at that point. It broke my heart and I can't even imagine what he feels since I've never had a loss that big in my own life. He began asking questions about her death (she overdosed) and you can tell he's just trying to put it all together. I did eventually excuse myself to give him and his dad some alone time to talk. I felt torn about that decision but I just felt they needed a moment together. Once they were done, my SS came to me and I asked him to come give me a hug. I pulled him up onto my lap and squeezed him and he asked why I had cried at the dinner table too. I told him that it hurts me to see him hurting because I love him so much. I let him know that I know I'll never be able to replace his mom but I will always love and protect him for her, that I didn't give him the gift of life but life has given me the gift of him, that he can always talk to me about anything, etc. He said that he is happy he gets to have two mom's, he's the sweetest boy. I'm looking for any and all suggestions on how to help him. I know the pain of her absence will always be there, but how can we make it easier? I recently asked his mom's mom for pictures so we can have some pictures of him and her together in the house. I thought about creating a picture/memory book for him to look through when he misses her. I just don't know what to do. FWIW; I had added my husband and SS on our insurance this year so we could get him some grief counseling but I have since been laid off due to COVID so therapy just isn't an option at this time.	stepparents
How would you attach a baby gate to these stairs?	Our 9-month-old has started crawling up a storm so we‚Äôre making up for lost time child-proofing our home.

I‚Äôm thinking I need to attach a piece of wood (2x2? 2x4?) on the right and then span across? Would ordinary drywall screws suffice?

M22 Why does shitty behavior not turn me off to women I‚Äôm attracted to?	I‚Äôve noticed that when looking for partners, that whenever I catch someone that I like a lot doing something that I think is bad, I don‚Äôt lose any attraction to them whatsoever. Say I catch them lying to me, or I find them behaving rudely to someone who doesn‚Äôt deserve it often, etc.... Usually when this happens my attraction for that person doesn‚Äôt waver a even little. I feel as though this could keep me from seeing red flags in potential because I‚Äôll get stuck with rose colored glasses on. Is this normal? Is there a way I can eliminate this?	dating_advice
Day 1 and I Am Broken	"**Right now I am broken. Broken up with and broken down. This is a record of my efforts to turn the extraordinary pain of heartbreak into something better and good so that one day I may be put back together.** I've always wanted to try and write a bit but I've been hindered by the fact that I am self-aware enough to know that I am not very good at it. This is the only time as an adult that I haven't been too self-conscious to write something that may be read by others\*. Right now I hurt too much to cringe so I am taking advantage. Silver linings. I tried to start something yesterday on Instagram but it wasn't right. I thought maybe if I just started doing a self-portrait every day from now until forever I'd feel better. But doing one reminded me that I am vain and that the first time around I only really got any pleasure when they were good, I can't be putting that pressure on myself now or there's a chance that I will crumble further (and maybe turn from crumbs to dust). I better explain the pain more fully before I start banging on about all of the things that I will do that will mean that one day I will be able to look back and say that it was pain but that it was ok (and mean it). Yesterday was day 0 It was sunny and I woke up late knowing I had no work that needed doing, just meetings in the morning and then a run. I am horribly unfit right now and running is not the joy it once was but little more than an unpleasant reminder of how far I've let things slide. Feeling myself flop sloppily around in a way I couldn't have done six months ago and rasp and gasp for air like a newly fished fish - it was not fun. But still, I do it and am glad I am doing it and thinking of a future me that is more like old running me but also happy like current me. Because yesterday, current me was happy. She was in love and thought that she was loved. I'd asked him for an album to listen to whilst I ran as I am shit with music and he is not. I can see now that his response was off, as too was the answer when I announced post-run that I would be coming over to his to work in the afternoon (our usual routine). Only off in small ways but no pet names, nothing extra - looking back it is all so clear. I was oblivious though and feeling fine and bouncy when I left my flat for his, I'd worn proper clothes for once, a loose red dress, even earrings and red lips to match. It's almost like I knew - dressing up so that at least I'd look good in that one scene that I'll probably replay more times than any other. He said ""We need to talk about this"" as if the ""about this"" would distract me from what we all know that means. It didn't distract me and I was totally overcome with dread. I accused him of being about to do exactly what he was about to do knowing the answer and knowing what it would mean for me. Before this, I really thought that I'd found my answer, after twenty-eight long years of looking, of trying, of desperately and so sadly searching. I thought that I'd done it, that I had things fixed. That I was going to be fine no matter what because I'd found that one person who makes everything fine. And now he was sitting beside me telling me I'd got it wrong, so wrong. To be quite honest, on this - day one, I still don't believe him. I hope I will come to believe it, that one day I won't look at this as the time that I missed out on my one chance of happiness but right now this is how it seems. So yeah. That's the backstory, or the end of it rather. Of course, the real backstory is the love itself. Maybe that will come with time. The question I'm grappling with now is how to make this ok. Not that I am trying to be too healthy about it or anything. I haven't eaten since Tuesday and I am currently sipping (gulping down) my third ""gin and water and frozen berries"" and it is not even 4pm, so don't fear - I am doing heartbreak completely and utterly properly. I just also do have this drive to make sure that I am doing something that I wouldn't be if I was still happy and in love. So firstly I am writing this which is something I would never have done were I still with him - not just for lack of material but also because I would have feared his judgement and been self-conscious. And secondly I will set myself goals here, very clear goals and I will be accountable because even though no-one will read this, it will be public and it will be here. Goal 1: Post a blog post here every day for a week. (Let's start small) \*I am also self-aware enough to know that no-one will actually read this which is making the whole thing quite a lot easier. [I'm writing here everyday and maybe it is helping.](https://www.brokendown.org/post/day-1-and-i-am-broken)"	BreakUps
Nobody supports my weight loss	Before university I(F22) was around 58-62kg (127-137 pounds). I was not too skinny, I‚Äôm 1.78m (~5‚Äô10) because I have never exercised so you know I look a bit thinner than avarage but nothing else. After 6-8 months in university I gained a lot of weight and was around 72-75kg (158-165pounds). I drunk a lot, ate really unhealthy and didn‚Äôt do anything at all. I felt bad and I could see how much I‚Äôve gained. In March when I had to move back home I started a diet and now I‚Äôm 65kg (143pounds) and I‚Äôm really happy about it! I feel more energetic and healthy, I look much better, my skin is glowing. I plan to be 58kg again (127pounds) and I work hard for this. My family and my boyfriend are mad. They said I look better when I had a little more weight on and I‚Äôm going to be too skinny and will not have any booty or breast. They always make rude comments on me and don‚Äôt care about that I feel better. I feel horrible that no one is happy about me feeling better and healthier and achieving this. (Like self and portion control are really hard and all my respect for those who lose a lot of weight). They always buy me something that they know I can‚Äôt eat. IMPORTANT! I don‚Äôt have any mental illness, I don‚Äôt see myself fat or anything I just like how fit and healthy I am starting to become.	offmychest

Interpreting the six ghost kids personalities.	We have basically nothing on their canon personalities, and maybe never will at this rate. So here's a collection of headcanons based on their behavior in the games. Feel free to add your own in the comments. Also I'm going with Cassidy possessing Golden Freddy, mainly because I'm sick of BV as a character. * **Jeremy** is always the first to try killing the nightguard and is the most persistent. From this, I'd say he's impatient and impulsive. He has the least qualms with killing nightguards, and may actively enjoy it the most. When he's backstage or in the west hall, he'll look into the camera with a demonic grin and a smug side eye respectively. This shows Jeremy is the most mischievous. Maybe he doesn't take any of this seriously and just wants something to do, at least in the beginning of the week. By possessing Bonnie, he has access to a usable guitar. Its likely he's played around with it many times, he might have even memorized a song or two. * **Susie** seems to be the least interested in this whole killing business. She wanders around the building in a daze and stares at the guard through the window for long periods. She goes along with it like the others, but I think Susie is troubled with what she's doing. I've seen it speculated that the clanking you hear in the kitchen is Susie trying to cook food. Given how sporadic the noises are, I see it as her banging pots and pans together as a form of stress relief. But I can see her making little snacks with the leftover ingredients when there's no nightguard to worry about. She's portrayed in Help Wanted as an active eater. Whether or not she can taste the food, I think she does it in order to feel more human. * **Fritz** is a very lonely kid. Being cooped up in a little stage separate from his friends for the majority of the day has taken a toll on him. Not to mention that he could be annoyed by the obnoxious pirate gimmick. Fritz is shy, nervous, and a little twitchy. His nerves can be seen with him frantically banging on the door in frustration. Perhaps the reason he attacks if you don't keep an eye on him is he doesn't like being left alone with himself and his thoughts. Then there's his signature run into the office. This is probably a stretch, but I like to think that Fritz was the athletic type when he was alive. Specifically a runner who did really well in track. As for UCN, Jeremy being present in his stage could represent that the two are very close friends. * **Gabriel** likes to be hidden. Most of the time he lurks in the shadows and is always the one to kill you when the power runs out. This is harder to interpret than the others, but I would guess that he's a somber child, more thoughtful and a bit distant. He's the only other person seen in the kitchen, so I like to imagine that he's become Susie's assistant while she's cooking. As for his lack of activity in the first two nights, I have my own theory. If we tie this in with him seemingly waking up in the middle of the night during the FNAF 2 cutscenes, as well as following Charlie while everyone else looks to be asleep in the save them minigame, I would say that Gabriel has some kind of sleeping problem. This could be caused by him possessing the mascot character, and as such getting more unwanted attention during performances. His inactivity is an attempt at getting some needed rest before trying to confront the nightguard. Help Wanted implies that he, like Charlie, is very attached to his music box. * **Cassidy** is an enigma, to say the least. She doesn't have any ongoing strategy like the others, instead choosing to pop out at random for an instant kill. Her suit not having an endoskeleton means she's capable of more supernatural abilities. During her encounter with Gabriel, she appears to be floating off the ground, or at least manipulating her suit into standing. She can teleport, disappear, and somehow send the phantom image of her head to kill people. I also find it interesting that after phone guy is dead, Cassidy seems to have recorded her own message on the phone. What she's saying is anyone's guess. In UCN, I don't think she created William's hell, but rather stumbled upon it and decided to make herself it's guardian. As such, some of her memories and perceptions of her time at Freddy's take form as William's tormentors. This is seen best with her depiction of Charlie, who she doesn't seem to have the fondest memories of. I imagine that the others see her as a very difficult person to try to talk to or console, as she prefers to be alone most of the time. * **Charlie** is arrogant and boastful. Even before her murder, it's likely being the daughter of the man who co-founded Freddy's led to a lot of bragging. After her death and possessing the Puppet, she spent a good few years completely alone with no one to talk to. This led to intense feelings of loneliness and frustration. Given that she knew William was the one that killed her, Charlie's desire to murder comes entirely from wanting to take out these emotions on others regardless of their actions. In a similar vein, her decision to attach the kid's souls to the robots is less about getting revenge on William and more to do with her wanting friends. Whether or not she actually gets along with them is debatable (especially Cassidy). Amidst the chaos, the one thing that can bring her instant comfort and security is the gentle melody of the music box.	fivenightsatfreddys
Had a very creepy SP experience/ dream	So last night I woke up and I was under the covers. I sleep with my head underneath the covers as well (sleep borito), and when I woke up I could hear someone in my room (I live alone) and the longer I listened the more I could make out this male voice whispering and really gross sounds. Then I realized this motherfucker was masterbating. Now, when I get SP sometimes my first instinct isn't fear, it's rage. Idk why but that's just how it is sometimes. Then its like I jumped out of my body I started swinging in the dark because I couldn't open my eyes. And I was screaming at this thing in my head to get the fuck outta my space, and I chased it into my closest where it jumped into this weird tunnel in the ceiling and disappeared. Then I was yanked back into my body and fell into a very long lucid dream. Can anyone relate? This is by far the creepiest one I've had in a very long time and I would like some advice.

On the list of possible activities: - hanging out and 420 to relax everyone - drinks are fine though, I personally don‚Äôt drink - some light making out between the three of us - my fwb wants to watch me get head from another guy (including licking my balls and ass) - she would also like to peg a man and maybe spit toast him with me in his mouth and her in his ass - following this, she would also like to get tag teamed and spit roasted herself [not guaranteed] If you think this sounds like a fun afternoon or evening, let us know! I‚Äôll be getting out the guys and she will have final approval. Thanks to everyone who reached out!	DirtyAtx4Atx

The first thing that led me down the rabbit hole that collapsed my shelf while working at the MTC was noticing how the church relied on out-of-context scriptures to teach the Great Apostasy. So here‚Äôs those scriptures and how the church misinterprets them. Hope this is helpful to someone.	This is my second post going through the scriptures the church uses in PMG. They really are grasping at straws when it comes to proving Mormon doctrine with the Bible. I don‚Äôt even really put a lot of stake in the Bible, but most Mormon interpretations fall apart just by being familiar with historical context, or the context of the rest of the chapter or book that a verse is found in. [My previous post about the nature of God and prophets can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/gh6day/my_shelf_experienced_a_catastrophic_collapse_when/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) **The Great Apostasy** Technically the next section should be Jesus Christ‚Äôs ministry, but there really isn‚Äôt much to go into with those scriptures. There‚Äôs descriptions of what Jesus did, and vague mentions of authority that could really mean anything, but the church naturally equates it to the Mormon priesthood. Anyways, the way they misinterpret scriptures to build this narrative about the Great Apostasy is a lot more interesting. I‚Äôm not going to go into the scriptures that talked about false teachers and what not. That was a relevant issue for the early Christian church, and I feel it is a stretch to say that they were prophesying and not just dealing with the matter at hand. So I‚Äôm going to skip those scriptures for the sake of length. **Amos 8:11-12** >11 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord: >12 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it. North and East are not directions listed to give you a sense of ‚Äúall over the place‚Äù. The North is where the nation of Israel was ‚Äútaken‚Äù by Assyria and the East is where the kingdom of Judah was taken by Babylon. These are verses talking about the condition of the Diaspora, not the apostasy. The diaspora, when the Jewish people were separated from their homeland, was also a time where they would be disconnected from their religion. Hence the famine of hearing the words of the Lord. Amos is not talking about the apostasy if Christ‚Äôs church. **Matthew 24:9-11** >9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name‚Äôs sake. >10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. >11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. Jesus seemed to think that the end times were nigh. That to me is one of the greatest ironies of citing any New Testament source to prove the Great Apostasy would be a thing. Jesus isn‚Äôt making a prediction, as much as saying that the current conditions are a sign of the times. Paul does the same thing. False teachers/prophets are always around. So it‚Äôs pretty convenient to say that they are a sign of the end days and that you need to not listen to them. Double irony is the church making reference to false prophets as being a sign of the times and not recognizing that they fit that description quite nicely. **Acts 3:20-21** >20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: >21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. Once again, the time of ‚Äúrestitution of all things‚Äù was thought to be right around the corner by the people who wrote this. And it‚Äôs not referring to the restoration of the gospel. It‚Äôs talking about the resurrection. Restitution of all things is written in better translations as ‚Äúuniversal restoration‚Äù. Which in context of Acts 3, and the theme of the New Testament in general, makes a lot more sense when understood as the resurrection, not the restoration that would happen once the early Christian community selves into apostasy for over 1000 years. **2 Thessalonians 2:3** >Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; This chapter is Paul refuting the idea that the day of the Lord has already come. He still believes it‚Äôs around the corner though. This is what he is referring to when he talks about men deceiving you in the first part of verse 3. The ‚Äúday of the Lord‚Äù is usually referred to the end of the world and traditionally includes the idea of a war between the forces of good and evil. Modern translations translate ‚Äúfalling away‚Äù as ‚Äúrebellion‚Äù. This verse isn‚Äôt talking about an apostasy that has to happen first, it‚Äôs talking about the forces of evil that will rebel against God in the battle at the end of the world. Plus, considering Paul thought the second coming was going to happen in his lifetime, this idea that he thought that a complete apostasy as the church teaches it would happen is ludicrous. **1 Timothy 4:1-3** >1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; >2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; >3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. This prooftext hinges on the interpretation of ‚Äúlatter times‚Äù as being the ‚Äúlatter days‚Äù expressed in the Church‚Äôs full name. Which doesn‚Äôt even make sense, considering the restoration is supposed to happen in latter times, not the apostasy. Additionally, ‚Äúlatter times‚Äù is basically New Testament language for ‚Äúthe last days‚Äù. Which Paul and all of the early Christians believed they were in. He‚Äôs not predicting, just once again explaining the current events and putting religious meaning behind them. **Up Next: The Restoration**	exmormon
First-generation college student preparing to transfer to a university. Looking for good schools that offer need-based aid. Overwhelmed and seeking advice, any little bit helps.	"Sophomore year of high school marked the onset of a nasty mental illness that would go undiagnosed for several years. My grades took a beating, I did zero ACT/SAT prep, and my family knew nothing about the college admissions process. I graduated by the skin of my teeth and spent the next couple of years in a dark place. Anywho, I'm now in my second year of community college and this spring I'll be submitting applications to transfer to a 4-year institution. Luckily, I live next to the University of Florida which has a high transfer rate from my CC, but I don't want to limit myself to one school, especially since UF isn't known for being generous with financial aid. Narrowing down my college selections has been daunting, to say the least. I have very little guidance, and navigating all of the information on the internet with no direction is starting to get overwhelming (seriously, how do people just *know* how to pick a college?) I've been prioritizing schools by how much need-based aid they offer (my EFC will be close to $0) and how transfer-friendly they are. Because I feel pretty secure about getting into UF, I'd like to look at more rigorous universities. Right now I have on my list **Wake Forest, Richmond, UNC, UVA, Bryn Mawr, Notre Dame, Vanderbilt, Smith**, and counting (as well as one or two safeties.) I realize that these schools are competitive, and I'm not going to be devastated if I only get accepted to my hometown university‚Äîits a good school. I'm also trying to go to law school after undergrad, and LSAT & GPA generally matter more than the school you attend. But I'd like to at least try. Alternatively, I'm also open to schools that meet my two main criteria and are perhaps less rigorous but would offer an enjoyable experience (I know that's vague.) Some of my info: * Major: Art History * GPA: 4.0 * ACT: 27 (Reading: 35, English: 32, Math: 17, Science: 23) I will be retaking this. * SAT (old version): 1740 (680 Reading, 660 Writing, 400 Math) I will be retaking this as well. * Extracurriculars: Until now, I've worked 40 hrs/wk (legal assistant; restaurant manager; University administration) to pay my bills, so I haven't had time to get involved on campus, but I will be listing my work experience. Fortunately, I'm moving back in with my parents this coming semester so I can focus on school. I'm in PTK but our chapter isn't very active. * I've recently begun participating in the Smithsonian's Transcription Center digital volunteer program, and I'm hoping to rack up at least 100 hours before I send off my applications (Side note: For anyone needing extra hours, interested in history/research, or just bored during quarantine, this program is *so* cool. You transcribe archived documents/audio files/etc. and the subjects range from astrophysics to women's history to art and more.) * I had an exceptionally challenging upbringing, and I've overcome a *lot.* It makes for excellent essay and personal statement fodder. Gotta do whatcha gotta do, lol. I'm just looking for a bit of direction. If I'm applying to the ""right"" places, If I should explore a different avenue, different school suggestions, ways to strengthen my application, etc. Am I being delusional about having any sort of shot at these schools? **As a first-generation student I'm going into this totally blind and I'm starting to panic. Any advice would be incredibly helpful.** (If anyone has suggestions regarding ACT/SAT prep tools, preferably on the more affordable side, I would love to hear those, as well.) Thank you to anyone who takes the time to offer their thoughts. <3"	ApplyingToCollege

Saftey	I am new to the world of CBD and have been seeing a lot of talk about these D8 products. Lately I have been in search of higher THCA strains for days I need a little extra. When these carts started popping up I saw a lot of skepticism about safety and what was in them. So my question is with the vendors that are selling these, how do you actually know whats in them? I noticed that they do edibles, and tinctures too, same thing with those? I want to try these types of products but I am extremely conscious about what I put in my system from a health standpoint. Has anyone done any tests of their own?	delta8
The Crimson Leviathan	# TL;DR A new boss, the Crimson Leviathan, its home being at a pillar of Netherrack and Crimson greenery (reddery?), a new ranged weapon the Boomerfang, Imagine your peacefully riding your strider through the lava oceans of the Nether towards an unnatural pillar piecing the surface with Crimson vegetation taking its *roots* there. As you get closer you hear a mighty roar as the elusive Crimson Leviathan bursts out of the surface and coils around the column, you're in for one helluva fight! # What is it? The Crimson Leviathan is a massive worm-like animal, with spikes chaotically piecing from its skin and the occasional Crimson plant. It is a whopping 18 blocks long and 2 blocks wide, earning its title of Leviathan. It is said that after a colossal time hibernating, *someone* woke it up, making it very, very angry. # Where do I find it? As stated before, the strange looking pillar is said to be its 'nest' housing the only other traces of its species, yes this thing is a mother, enjoy the guilt you feel after killing it and discovering its probably unfertile eggs, now knowing that it was only defending its children and would probably stop attacking if you just left. There is only one Leviathan in a world at a time, though the pillars are as common as Strongholds, the only thing they are holding, however, is an empty nests and a few skulls. NOTE: The Crimson Leviathan will respawn at a different pillar once defeated after 2 10 in-game days. # Attacks How will this thing kill you, you ask? In many, many very painful ways. It has a few attacks it can do, it will sink under the lava, swim around for a bit, then violently emerge at the location you were about 3 seconds ago, it can also take a delicious gulp of magma then spit it at you, setting you on fire if it hits you, etc. # The Loot So, you've killed it, either legitimately or using some exploit, it's done. What is your reward? Juicy loot. The Crimson Leviathan drops 1 Boomerfang and 12 Netherite Scrap. Your probably wondering 'What the hell is a Boomerfang?' A new ranged weapon. Upon throwing it, it will leave your inventory and travel in a straight line of a max of 40 blocks, at about a sheep's running speed, then return to you at an equal speed. It will deal 6 hearts of damage, and pierce enemies but only on the return trip. Its one great flaw, however, is it cannot be enchanted, but is unbreakable, due to once being the Leviathan's tooth. I hope you liked my idea!	minecraftsuggestions

One hour market update	So nothing really unexpected going on currently. I bought KTOV at $0.37 Friday sold at $0.50 today (26% move) and moved into BIOC at $0.42. Will exit if it hits $0.37 or lower. I think KTOV is still going higher but I‚Äôm happy with that trade. However watch that $0.50 level for KTOV and trade accordingly. 1st target for BIOC is $0.5096 2nd target $0.6927	pennystocks

Is this a greenflag?	I mean, I was NOT even having a crush on this girl, to me she is nothing more than a friend, a girl who is a friend to me. Nothing big. But there was time that she says things like ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt have anyone to actually love later in life, maybe having you as a friend is enough.‚Äù There was once when we was hanging out together, we took the bus home, and she asked me to ‚Äútake her around the town on my Honda‚Äù (I live in Vietnam so Honda is quite common). She leaned on my shoulder and all that closeness is great, but that feeling is gone after, and I am convinced that it is just me being high due to intimacy. She asked me tomorrow to take her to school because she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have money to take a Grab bike‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know, this makes me sound like I am just a guy freaking out on girl, but no I am just confused whether she is giving me green flag or not. We are pretty close as friends, but not as lovers, yet I genuinely don‚Äôt have any feelings that can be classified as ‚Äúlove‚Äù towards her. If she is sad, I am the one who she thinks of first to vent. She is in a relationship with a girl (she said that she is bisexual, and she has only been dating girls only), but does she have anything more than just a friend for me?	love

36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar. If you're on the same page, hit me up."	chat

Almost Ten Years of Assets and Debt my Personal Finances over a decade	I have been tracking my finances with Mint for almost 10 years now. I thought some of you might find this chart interesting. It is my cash, investments, and non-mortgage debt over the last 9.5 years. I annotated it to highlight major financial events in my life. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/z1qhbwsvcx4gf9q/10%20years%20of%20Debt%20and%20Assets.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z1qhbwsvcx4gf9q/10%20years%20of%20Debt%20and%20Assets.png?dl=0) Since I started tracking I graduated from university, did some grad school, worked at 3 different jobs, got married, bought a home, had 2 kids. In the last 5 months, the stock market crash had a larger effect on my assets than buying a car did 5 years ago. I leave out mortgage debt, home value and car value. those are hard to track precisely over time or drastically skew the latter half of the chart.	PersonalFinanceCanada

Glorious Freedom	"NOT LOOKING FOR ADVICE OR ANYTHING! JUST SHARING MY STORY! This post is late, but it is still due. On Saturday, my wife and I drove 2.5 hours away to pick up my brand new 2020 Iron 1200 in Barracuda Silver (a must). My brother lived in the city I picked the bike up in and he met me there on his bike (2019 Yamaha Bolt C-Spec). Prior to picking this bike up, I had minimal experience. I completed the Harley MSF course in January and haven't been in the saddle since. That all changed when I picked up this beaut. After a couple of laps around the Harley Dealership, it was time. With an abundance of caution, my brother and I, with my wife and pup following in a car behind us, we were out of the parking lot driving off into the city of wonder. Before I knew it, I was up to 55MPH (speed limit) and the wind was relieving my years of stress. By Saturday evening, the bike was broken in (according to the service manager at Harley, ride 45 minutes shifting through all the gears and all RPM ranges, let cool 20 min, ride 45 min. again, and cool again, this will break a motorcycle in when you live in the mountains). Over the course of the weekend, my brother, who was beyond supportive and provided just enough constructive criticism, had pushed me just out of my comfort zone. We rode down empty streets, busy roadways, highway stretches, mountain curves, and everything in between. I wasn't so far out of my comfort zone as to where an accident was imminent. I was pushed out just enough to where I didn't have a choice but to experience what the world had to offer. He rode at his speed in the twisties, I rode at mine. As any great leader of a group ride would, he waited for me when the time was right. I was never pushed to run faster or to place myself in dangerous situations. Come yesterday around 4 PM, our weekend of riding was concluded, together anyway. When we split ways, he had a 1-hour commute home and I was looking at a daunting 2.5-hour commute home. We exchanged blessings of safe commutes and the normal ""love ya's"" that we do, and off we were to our homes. After the weekend riding with him, I was a lot less intimidated by the long commute home (my wife was also behind me the whole way with the pup watching from the back seat). I quickly realized that due to all the experience I was given over the weekend, this commute was nowhere near as daunting. In fact, it was peaceful and exhilarating at the same time. No jitters, no fear, just fun. By 8 PM last night, the bike was parked and my wife and I were enjoying some rest and relaxation after a long weekend. What a time to be alive. For this weekend, and the days, years, decades to follow, the ride made me forget the current state of affairs, my daily stressors, and anything and everything that didn't pertain to the ride. Alas, I am now part of the family, not just the motorcycle community, but the Harley Davidson community. TL;DR: Bought 2020 Iron 1200 in Barracuda Silver. Brother and I rode all weekend, broke her in, put over 250 miles on her, and made a 2.5-hour commute back to the home city as a 3rd-day rider."	Harley
Possible PCOS diagnosis	Hello everyone! I‚Äôve lurked here on and off over the last year due to suspicions that my combination of symptoms pointed to PCOS. I had a wellness exam today (my first in about five years) and my new PCP confirmed that it‚Äôs very likely the culprit. I‚Äôm going in tomorrow morning for labs to check my blood sugar levels and for any hormone irregularities. I‚Äôm feeling a little overwhelmed but also like a big weight has been lifted? I‚Äôve struggled with my weight, irregular/unpredictable periods, and a lot of unwanted facial hair for YEARS, and honestly just thought it was my unlucky lot in life, but to possibly have an answer for all of it finally? It‚Äôs a welcome relief. So I just wanted to say hi and that I‚Äôm so glad there‚Äôs a supportive subreddit out there for people struggling with this particular issue. üíõ	PCOS

It‚Äôs getting hard	It‚Äôs getting really hard to believe that God loves me. I was 100% healthy my whole life. Then in 2016 everything changed and it just keeps getting worse and worse. I‚Äôve had health anxiety my whole life but I had it under control for the most part. In 2016 my mom has a stroke. She recovered fine and didn‚Äôt have any lingering effects, thank God. At the same time I had an abnormal pap which turned out to be ok and I‚Äôve had normal ones ever since. Then in 2017 I had a lump in my breast which also turned out to be nothing serious... then 2018 hit and I took my mom to the ER because we thought she was having another stroke. She tuned out to be ok again. I had some weird inverted ear drum thing which made it hard to hear but it eventually went away. At the same time my sister moved far away and a lady at work died.. then I started getting pressure in my head and I felt dizzy from it all the time... in July 2019 I ended up going to the doctor for the head pressure thing and she said it was tension headaches... so I have been dealing with that ever since. Back in October 2019 I had gotten 2 dry red patches of skin on my legs... turns out I now have nummular eczema. It did go away after using steroid cream but I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs a chronic illness and I‚Äôll have to deal with flare ups for the rest of my life... I just don‚Äôt understand what I did so wrong to deserve all of this happening to me. It feels like God hates me and isn‚Äôt even there for me. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve become so depressed.	Christian

If I clear advanced next year, I think I‚Äôll stay here but if I don‚Äôt, should I try to go to Germany?

Threatening Jury Votes Strategy	"This is a strategy I've wondered about while rewatching RI and other seasons and I don't know of it's even allowed. After the merge in RI, Ometepe is up 7-5 and vote out one of their own. Now 6-5, Zapatera works like crazy to try and get one of them to open up their eyes and see that they are brainwashed robots. Alas, they don't and the get Pagonged. My idea for a strategy is this: After the first Zapatera member gets picked off and the numbers are 6-4, they see the writing on the wall and are pretty much sitting ducks. They know Rob is completely in control and brainwashed his fellow 5 Ometepe members. What if they go up to Rob and say, ""We know you're in control, if you don't take put a few Ometepe people before you tale all of us out, the 4 of us will vote against you at FTC."" Let's just say it's not a bluff and they will follow through with it. That would force Rob to do something, because if someone is definitely getting 4 votes at FTC, then all they need is 1 more and hes screwed. I've only seem s1-22 and s38-40. Has this strategy ever been used or thought of? Is it allowed? What are your thoughts?"	survivor
For anyone who did not know about this amazing reference in S31E20...	"So I recently saw this episode and was amazed to see my favorite musical adopted by The Simpsons, where Lisa sings a song similar to ""Maybe some time"", originally sung by Lisa Minelli (heh) in 1972 movie ""Cabaret"", which is set in 1931 Germany.

Opinion - All of the Insidious movies are good	Not saying this is unpopular, just my opinion after watching The Last Key today. Some of the movies are better than others, and there are definitely things I think each one could have done better, but none of them fall completely flat or aren't worth seeing if you enjoy any of them. Have to say I was pretty impressed that we got 3 sequels that were just as worthwile. If you like any of them, or are a fan of this brand of 2010s horror, there's four movies worth adding to your list.	horror

"Weird dream about ""Candle Girl."""	"I just woke up, so please forgive my atrocious grammar. I want to write all of this down before I forget. Btw, I am not Catholic. I grew up Southern Baptist. Last night I dreamed of browsing through a book intensively detailed about saints with pictures, and I somewhat paused at the name of a female saint from France (not Joan of Arc). Suddenly, a woman showed up in the bedroom, and by then, the surrounding was unfamiliar to me. The room consisted of rusty, old-fashioned furniture. It was dim. She informed me that she only appears to people whose times are not ready for them (she mentioned Salem, Mass, and many other places). She explained that she goes by ""Candle Girl,"" even though she has a real name, and the only birth she appeared was at Jesus Christ's. She changed her appearance several times while talking to me. Firstly, she looked like a white woman with a sly demeanor. Secondly, her face shifted to a Medusa-like figure, only with the skin of a tree. Lastly, her head was of a cow skull. She mentioned that the last time somebody saw her was that saint I found in the book, and the world changed. She disappeared, and then I found myself in another dream. I somehow ended up praying to her for wisdom when I didn't know where she was, and the environment was unsettling. I woke up right after praying to her. That is quite baffling. I am not knowledgable about saints, and even while growing up, Christianity always seemed off to me. There is a possibility that my hormones are playing with me because it seems as if my period is late, and even though the pregnancy tests are negative, people say that it is too early to test. What do you guys think? Does 'Candle Girl' sound familiar?"	pagan

BTRFS Cache reliability concerns	"I posted a similar question on the Unraid forums, interested in hearing what reddit thinks: [https://forums.unraid.net/topic/92264-btrfs-cache-reliability-concerns/](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/92264-btrfs-cache-reliability-concerns/) &#x200B; Hi, I'm wondering if BTRFS is the right solution for a resilient cache / storage solution? I run two Unraid servers, primary 40TB disk plus 2TB cache (4 x 1TB SSD), secondary 26TB disk plus 2TB cache (4 x 1TB SSD). On two occasions I've lost my entire Cache volume due one of the drives ""failing"". I say failing, but really both times it was my own fault, I didn't want to shut down, and I pulled the wrong drive, and immediately plugged it back in. But this is no different to a drive failing, or a connection failing. Pulling disks during certification of large resilient storage systems is a perfectly good test. One would expect the loss of 1 disk in a 4 disk BTRFS RAID10 config to be a non-issue, not so, first the log started showing BTRFS corruption issue, ok, seems it is not being auto fixed, then I run a cache scrub, no errors, still errors in the log, scrub with repair, reported repaired. Then I started getting docker write failures, seems my cache became read-only, and BTRFS corrupt. In both cases I resorted to rebuilding the cache from scratch, and restored appdata backups, lost the VM's (unlike docker stop/restart no easy way to backup VM's). I've run hardware RAID for a long time, including hardware that uses SSD caching, I've lost disks, pulled disks, but in all cases the array eventually comes back on its own. I simply do not have the same trust in Unraid's cache, I think it is fragile, I think it is unreliable to the point where it needs to be backed up constantly. I'd like to see the Unraid/Limetech publish their resiliency test and performance plans? What is tested for, what are known failure scenarios, what are known recoverable scenarios, are my expectations of resiliency and performance unfounded? And this is not about BTRFS, this is about Unraid, I don't care what Unraid uses for the cache volume, it could have supported SSD's in data volumes and no cache would be required, it could have used ZFS and we would have different problems, BTRFS was an Unraid choice, and I find it fragile. What are your experiences with cache resiliency?"	unRAID

Actual Definition of TCGLow?	I've been selling on a few different places recently and I list my cards as TCGLow - 10%, which is the standard I see. I go through and update my prices once every couple of days and tell people I'll drop to 10% TCGLow if the prices have fluctuated. Now, I've had a few people argue with me/cancel orders because they think my prices are too high. They want the TCGPlayer App calculation of 'TCGLow' instead of the lowest listing price -10%. My assumption/undestanding is TCGLow -10% is the current lowest listing price (considering condition) -10% and not the lowest the card has ever been -10%, which some people seem to want. Unfortunately, there isn't a live 'TCGLow' number because 'Market Price' is always lagging behind, but I'm not going to take another 20-30% off of something because it was lower last month.	mtgfinance

My friends held me being ‚Äògifted‚Äô against me	When I got into enrichment ( gifted program if it‚Äôs different for others) my friend told me my other friend ( f2 from now on) hadn‚Äôt even gotten in to test and was sad. And that I didn‚Äôt deserve to be happy about it. They used this as a guilt trip for years, any time we got into a fight or a friend got into a fight and we were on opposite sides, they used it against me. I told them over and over again that it‚Äôs not my fault I got in and f2 didn‚Äôt. I said I thought f2 would, that f2 was smarter than me ( completely true). They finally stopped and have grown up. It was tiring and I‚Äôm glad they no longer try to use it against me, but I still feel awkward talking about enrichment in front of f2. That‚Äôs my story for today, anyone else have friends ( or just people) who did the same thing to them?	Gifted
Overcoming injury as athlete - No will to live	Hello, I am 24 year old martial artist and I competed in alot of martial arts with a goal of going as far as I can in mixed martial arts, like 2 years ago I started having back issues and it got really serious to point where I can't do any training besides specific stretches and I have alot of problems sleeping, until Corona started I worked as Kickboxing coach and that helped me a bit to get that ''fix'' of fulfilment. Even before injury I had some form of depression my whole life which I guess I took from my dad who is depressed since I know him, but I was learning alot about it and found my way to deal with it with having strucutured days and always being focused on some sort of goal, when It got bad I would do my best to funnel that anger i sadness into focus for my career I would go to gym and start drilling tehniques, now that I can't do that anymore its getting worse and worse and I am starting to be afraid because its not just being sad and angry anymore but I'm getting new ''symptoms'' like new bad thoughts and my reactions to everything are getting worse, I feel like all my qualities that I had are dying and I really dislike my self, I provide no money to my family, I feel like heavy burden since we are not rich to ''afford'' me being like this, we are not poor but not wealthy enough for me to not be able to help. Before I very very rarely cried, and currently its often occurrence that I start crying and I have hard time stopping and most of time that I am awake I spend having like pressure feeling in my chest, like when you are really angry/sad and for first time in my life I got like some sort of panic attack 2 times in 4 days where my body suddenly felt really weak and I was all dizzy/headache. I tried everything to deal with this until I fix my back which is also on ''pause'' because of corona, In last year I tried drinking, doing drugs, eating very healthy, eating very unhealthy, playing video games all day, reading books, learning something new like psychology which always interested me, but nothing is working, some of it helped for like week or few weeks but I am out of ideas. Its been a while that I don't mind dieing, I'm tired of dealing with back pain whole day and seeing that everyone is improving and getting better as fighters while I am stuck and getting worse and worse physicaly, which is probably my biggest problem I feel like my dream for which I sacrificed alot for already of becoming elite fighter is getting crushed and I feel hopeless, every day is just dealing with both physical and mental pain and Its starting to have effects on my health in other ways, my best friend also passed away recently so I don't have someone to really talk about it like this, even with him it was/would be hard for me to talk about like this. All i see is negative and not having ''goals'' is really taking a toll on me, I am starting to be afraid of suicide, I don't want to do it but it often comes to my mind but I just shake it off fast, but that thought is becoming more clearer like ''cons'' of it are becoming less valuable and ''pros'' more valuable if that makes sense and that scares me, I don't want to give up but I don't know how to fight it. I never talk about this like this so its hard for me to explain everything especially since my english is not great and I don't except someone to really read all of this but I decided to force my self to write about it somewhere, I have nothing to lose and maybe someone went through something similliar or have experience with stuff like this here. My lets say ''question'' is do you have some suggestion/tip what to do ? How to deal with this, my whole life since i was 4 is training and doing my best to become best and that helped me a ton with my depression, without it I am really lost and I'm losing it, I want to get better for me and for those who care about me. Thanks a ton to anyone reading this <3	overcoming
36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar.

Here's some other hints as to what people wanted: ‚Ä¢ During the alpha/beta, people criticized how the British looked and praised the Germans. ‚Ä¢ People started pointing out how the only fully (excluding gear) British torso in the game was the Patriot, while everything else was American. ‚Ä¢ People noticed that the Germans have better outfits overall. ‚Ä¢ A subreddit dedicated to making custom/accurate uniform combinations was created (r/BattlefieldCosmetics) ‚Ä¢ People start pointing out inaccuracies (ex: the size of the Stahlhelm). ‚Ä¢ People start making accurate uniforms in photoshop, which end up looking better than what we got. ‚Ä¢ The gas mask fiasco. ‚Ä¢ When the denison smock and other accurate british uniforms were teased in Chapter 4, people were foaming at the mouth for them. They never came. ‚Ä¢ The wanderer styled sets are very accurate skins, and as such, many people bought them. ‚Ä¢ The themed bundles (Burnt, Halloween) were hated by people because of how out of place the skins looked, as well as the fact that they could be used by all factions. ‚Ä¢ Everybody praised the accurate uniforms that were added into the Pacific. ‚Ä¢ Throughout the game's entire life cycle, people point out how pieces of equipment from way after WWII are slapped onto outfits. ‚Ä¢ Battlefield 1. The entirety of Battlefield 1 proves that people like authenticity a lot. And to throw that authenticity out of the window was a really bad idea on DICE's part. So yeah... I just find it hard to believe that they didn't have at least a bit of an idea as to what people wanted. DICE at the very least should've just made the same amount of accurate skins as inaccurate skins and added an option to disable inaccurate skins. Presto, now you've appealed to history buffs and people who don't care, and you'd still be making a profit. Win win for all. EDIT: I'll add more if people can think of more hint"	BattlefieldV

-2 stocks for SD	Why is this even a thing? If someone wants to kill themselves, they are going to do it anyway.. what use is it to make it quicker? Sure its a rare thing to happen, but the most rage-inducing event is when your winning a game, the opponent(s) are down to their last stock, you loose your first stock, and then SD afterwards by accident before getting hit. You go from 3 stocks to out in a matter of seconds. Sure its your fault, but if it were just 1 stock, then you would still be in the game. Why do you have to loose 2? The times this has happened to me is generally on moving stages or stages with moving floors, with characters with bad recoveries.. Someone tell me why the 2 stock punishment for SDing makes any sense?	SmashRage
How do you guys stop urban exploration on your newer properties?	This issue has been in the media recently, where a jogger was doing some urban exploration on a property and was mistakenly shot. But it brings up an issue I‚Äôve had for years on my newer properties, with suburban white women and homosexuals thinking it‚Äôs okay to trespass if they just want a look. It‚Äôs a slippery slope because when they come on the property then joggers and everyone else think it‚Äôs okay to trespass, as well. Has anyone dealt with this issue? How did you resolve it ü§î	LoveForLandlords

My dom is never emotional and never shows his feelings but I made him feel giddy and super flattered over this odd compliment	"So my fianc√© and I are complete opposites. I am very emotional and he is very rational. Despite we have conflicting interests, which I find sometimes annoying, I believe our differences makes us attracted to each other. Hear me out--he is the type of man who never becomes emotional over the small stuff. He is not open with his feelings. Like what I said, he is rational...almost too good to be true. STORY: My fianc√© and I were separated because of quarantine. Awhile ago, during our nightly phone calls, he mentioned to me that he recently almost drank every night since he found it enjoyable to do so while watching Netflix. Even if I was concerned about his health and weight, I told him to enjoy himself. Due to the heavy traffic he endured several months ago due to his previous work and the sudden unemployment he experienced afterwards before quarantine, I liked him to have fun for now especially that he is now working from home. Also, he is now working in a respectable company. However, he said, ""what if after this we see each again and you see me have a big belly?"" And my reply, ""I still love you no matter what."" And you know what? He acted so giddy like a little girl and his voice went high pitched saying, ""really? you'll still love me?"" Of course, I said yes! Gosh, out of all the cheesy confessions I told him and he did not show emotions about it, this simple comment, ""I'll still love you no matter what"" works wonders?? Can you guys explain why?"

My (29M) SIL (23F) has been listening in while i fuck my wife (27F)	My wifes sister was staying with us for a few weeks when her mum threw her out. That turned into few months and now shes been here almost a year. My wife and I have a healthy relationship but always tried to keep it down when we had sex because she thought it was a bit wierd if SIL heard us (apprently not weird enough to not have sex though). But alot of the time we get caught in the moment and end up loudee than we expected to be. I noticed my SIL had started to get a lot more comfortable around the house. Wearing sports bras around the house and one time i even walked into the kitchen in the early hours and she was making a coffee in her underwear. She didn't even bat an eye. Just continued her conversation with me. The other night she had an online Zoom quiz with her friends and asked if she could use our laptop. The day after, i used the laptop for work but she had left her WhatsApp Web logged in and i saw a conversation with her friend on her Foorball Team about how she'd been listening to us having sex for weeks and thought it was hot. Am i reading to much into this or is she trying to make a move? I would never cheat on my wife but god damn her sister is attractive.	SluttyConfessions

Why the trident is the best item in minecraft (I totally didn't spend ages making a crappy copypasta)	***Why the trident is the best item in minecraft*** A trident is basicly the best item in the game, unlike all the other items except shields and boats (which are boring) the trident has a wonderfull 3d texture. Some people could argue that a arrow has the same kind of thing, but NO, the arrow has no volume, it's just 2 flat faces. The trident, as well as having a lovely 3d texture also has it's own unique animation when you're holding it. The trident is a far more sophisticated weapon than a sword, for swords you just bruteishly bash people with them but with a trident you can throw them AND stab people with them. Tridents can also be used with the riptide enchantment and an elytra to FLY REALLY FAST during a thunderstorm. Unlike netherrite swords the trident can be edited on PMCskin3d and posted on PlanetMinecraft. And then we have the sound it makes. The trident makes a WONDERFULL ding sound when thrown, unlike the boring nethrite sword which is clearly not as good as the lovely TRIDENT. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.	Minecraft
I just experienced the worst thing while hosting a catalogue party	My friend and I were hosting our first ever catalogue party through turnip exchange at my island. Things were going swimmingly, and everyone was so polite. It started going downhill when someone didn‚Äôt follow the rules I set out, and began taking everyone‚Äôs furniture without putting them down. I repeatedly typed out, ‚Äòdrop the items‚Äô but that person would not listen and began taking the free furniture and DIY‚Äôs I laid out too. My friend and I tried to block the bridge so she couldn‚Äôt leave, but this BLOODY TROLL WHIPPED HER BLOODY POLE OUT and was about to jump over the river to leave (I know, I should‚Äôve fenced the river). I quickly apologised to everyone and ended the session right there. I‚Äôm beyond angry and disappointed with what just happened. Thinking back on it now, I should‚Äôve just forced shutdown my switch or closed the game entirely. That would have probably made the game not save, and the other people could still have their furniture with them. This whole situation has just put me off and I probably won‚Äôt be hosting something like this again. This is my warning to you all. Please be careful when hosting something similar to this. If you‚Äôre using turnip exchange, maybe end the session when an unknown person that is not in queue, rocks up to your island. Another thing maybe, is to have people mention their in-game name so you know who‚Äôs travelling to your island. Please don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. I feel incredibly guilty to the three other people that got their furniture stolen. Suffice to say, I‚Äôve learnt my lesson.	ac_newhorizons
Would uploading this fic be offensive?	This might be a weird question, but I want to hear people's opinions on it. Since 2017, I have been working on a particular Pokemon fanfic that is currently unpublished because it required such a large amount of work. I'm talking over 160 Fakemon (complete with Pokedex entries, Abilities and movesets), a brand new region and an entire cast of OCs kind of big. Just last month, I got to a point where I was ready to start writing...and then I realised that one of the Legendary Pokemon represented disease...and we're in a pandemic... So...is now not a good time? Would you guys be offended if something like this popped up during a pandemic? When I came up with this fic and put so much work into it, I had no idea that the world would face something like this by the time I was about to post it, but I've put so much work into this, and I'll be so frustrated if about 3 years of hard work goes down the drain. I keep thinking about how much backlash a TV channel in my country got when they played Contagion just as the virus started to spread. How long would it be safe to leave this after the pandemic ends? Maybe I should just write the fanfiction and post it when I'm finished. That'll be, like, 6 years down the line, based on past experiences with my writing speed (I'm joking, of course).	FanFiction

Elon's Divine Restraint	So far Elon has shown extraordinary restraint by merely suing Alameda County, who audaciously blockaded his Tesla Freemont factory in a vain attempt to stop it from reopening. Similarly Elon's passing comment that he's relocating Freemont production and their HQ to Texas/Nevada can be viewed as a reasoned and reasonable response to these crackpot dictums of pettyfogging bureaucrats. So why, we ask ourselves is Elon withholding his hand, and not gone wrath of God on these MFBs? In less than an hour he could go full on and ICBM their ass, fools deserve it. No doubt Alameda will soon come to their senses, when they pull their head out - and get back on track to a far more ecological future!	SpaceXMasterrace
36M - Teachers Need Love Too	"Hi all, I'm just a bored high school teacher whose district is not asking much of teachers or students right now for equity reasons, meaning that my weeks mostly consist of sending e-mails, making assignments, and ""grading."" Let's just say it's not really a 40-hour work week. My home life, on the other hand, has been moderately insane, meaning that the days have taken on a kind of Groundhog Day-like inanity which combines this intense boredom with a lot of repetitive and often mind-numbing activity. I'll not go into a ton of detail on this, but you might be able to guess what I mean. What I'm looking for: Interesting conversation, flirting, or just asking questions of each other. I'd like to have something to look forward to every time I open my computer. Someone to talk to between grading papers. Someone who needs something similar. If you're on the same page, hit me up."	chat

respect people's pronouns	&#x200B; Its simple respect, just respect how others want to be treated as such. You don't have to agree with them even, but you should just always respect everyone.

Just treat people nicely. edit: damn holy fuck a lot of you are assholes &#x200B;	teenagers

[NEWBIE] I am starting to suck less!	"I'm hoping this can serve as some motivation for my beginning peers. &#x200B; THE SHORT VERSION: After 2 weeks of wanting to quit due to struggling without achieving any tangible progress, I am FINALLY seeing real results. &#x200B; THE LONG VERSION: Out of sheer boredom, I was idly browsing online guitar sites (probably thanks to some kind of a Facebook ad) and I considered how ridiculous I'd look trying to buy a nice guitar in person. ""Hmmm...the E minor chord sounds very nice on this one. I'll take it!"" I am essentially a beginner after having been away from the guitar for (oh God) 20+ years. About to hit 40, stuck in quarantine, the bug bit me. Noodling around on my own these last 2 months helped me quickly remember the reason why I gave up in my teen years. I don't have a natural talent. And EVERYONE ELSE IS better than me. I am always going to be picked last in guitar gym class. Throughout the years, whenever I'd be at a party, or over at someone's house, I'd get drinking and want to show off with the one or two songs I actually knew how to play. And all the people that called themselves terrible at guitar would take a turn and blow me out of the water. They'd get through the recognizable parts on songs and do some finger tricks that looked complicated af to me. Even so-called 'terrible guitar players' wiped the floor with me. That kind of crap always killed my motivation and made me stop wanting to go any further. It wasn't fair. How come they all learned how to do cool stuff while barely practicing!! (So I thought.) Another issue I had was trying to be self-taught (like all the best rock musicians are). I'd invariably find myself reinforcing what I already knew how to do, and I would quickly get frustrated when not seeing progress on trying to learn new stuff. Anyway. Knowing there would never be a better time to just sit and practice by myself, I came to this subreddit and soon found my way over to justin guitar. At first I had to force myself to follow the lesson plan. It's not that I wasn't having fun, but I hated feeling like I would never get much better than being okayish at the lesson material no matter how hard I tried -- like there was a raw talent limit that would hold me back forever. But I kept making myself practice every day. Just for 20 minutes. Buzzing strings. Painful fingers (after being away from it for so long). Lots of sighing. Lots of beating myself up over how terrible and limited I was. But I kept coming back every day. Trying to remember how different driving is today versus when I first started. Or riding a bicycle. Or typing on a keyboard. Or even learning to read. Seriously, my big motivator was thinking about all the things in my life that run on autopilot for me today that took tons of effort and continuous practice to get any good at. And it was still tough. Because day after day I felt like I wasn't getting better. Some days I'd think I was even getting worse. I don't know how to fully articulate this, but something happened this weekend. I sucked less. The buzzing was less frequent. My fingers were remembering how to make shapes faster. I still sucked. But...noticeably less. Then, today, I made it through all of my basic chord changes without ANY buzzing. And I was able to do it sort of quickly. After 2 weeks of telling myself I was absolutely hopeless, and certain that I'd just quit, I SUCKED LESS. And it feels incredible. Hopefully this can serve as exactly the kind of story that can help another beginner push past that initial hump into believing this whole journey is possible. I'm excited to be working my way up to the day where I can go into the guitar store and say ""I'm still a beginner. But my practice regime feels and sounds real good on this thing. I'll take it."""

How do I tell my best friend that I wasn't as drunk as he thought he got me and I remember what he did to me?	So me and my best friend downed an entire bottle of Vodka and got superrr drunk. But, he drank more than me. I still was not thinking clearly and I wasn't all there, but I still can kinda remember what was going on. I was kinda in and out. We were sleeping over together and were both on an air mattress. I remember dozing off, and then waking up to him giving me a blow job. It took me a while to process it, but I was so confused that I just kinda let it happen. Then he grabbed my hand and put it on his dick and started moving my hand up and down until I was giving him a hand job. I was still so drunk that I was really confused as to what was happening, and I just kinda did it but I didn't mean it at ALL. Then he bent over and grabbed my dick and tried to get me to put it in his ass and that's when I stopped because I was finally realizing what was happening. I shoved him off of me and I went to sleep. I woke up in the morning and got out of there before he could wake up. I still haven't talked to him. I don't know whether to fake that I don't remember to keep our friendship or to confront him and not be friends. I'm straight and I'm 16. I've had sex before but not with guys (obviously) and luckily this wasn't sex but it was still really weird. What should I do?	Advice
Other Personas based on roguish modern fictional characters or historical figures?	We've had Arsene and >!Raoul!<, Captain Kidd and >!William!<, Carmen and >!Celestine!<, Goemon and >!Gorokichi!<, Johanna and >!Agnes!<, Necronomicon and >!Al Azif!<, Milady and >!Lucy!<, Robin Hood and >!Hereward!<, Cendrillon and >!Ella and finally Valjean.!< I love all these neat references to modern fictional characters and historical figures. It makes me wonder what other references could be there that would be a suitable Persona within P5. I know that the Scruffy ACAU has used Black Bart, Anne Bonny, Mata Hari, Metrodora, Jeanne d'Arc, Pythia and Odysseus (Nice P2 callback). But aside from that what else would be a neat Persona to see with the rogue like references to fiction and history? Just a fun discussion have leave any ideas in the comments below with the name, the reference and how it would look like for a Phantom Thief. I'll go first: [Fantomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fant%C3%B4mas) > *A fictional character created by French writers* *Marcel Allain* *(1885‚Äì1969) and* *Pierre Souvestre* *(1874‚Äì1914). One of the most popular characters in the history of French* *crime fiction* *where he represented a transition from* *Gothic novel* *villains of the 19th century to modern-day* *serial killers**.* > >*Is known to be a criminal genius, ruthless and particularly elusive as the cause of almost any unsolved crime, a merciless criminal who can get away with his evil deeds by impersonating pretty much anyone as a master of disguise. He was created and introduced few years after Arsene Lupin, another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fant√¥mas has no such qualms and is shown as a sociopath who enjoys killing in a sadistic fashion that shows no mercy to anyone.* I find it interesting that whilst we have Arsene for Joker we don't have a Persona that could serve as like a rival or shadow archetype to the Gentleman Thief. He could have worked as a Persona for Akechi fitting his Black Mask self. For it's appearance I imagine it to look sort of like the Black Ghosts from Ajin Demi-Human.	Persona5

Help rebuilding my Templar	I've been playing this game on and off for the last 2 years without a whole lot of knowledge of making my own builds, and thanks to Quarantine I've been playing this game a lot recently and I wanted to revisit my first toon; a Templar with a wanna be Paladin feel but I didn't want to make another Healer or Tank so I wanted to make him a dedicated Off-tank with tanking and healing capabilities. I've been following some of Alcasts' builds and read his advanced Tanking Guide so I wanted to give it a shot. The focus is more so about Trials than Dungeons (Though I'm sure with the way it's set up now it can easily handle a few vet dungeons). Here's the link to my build, and if there're any questions let me know, I'm just wondering if this setup is viable enough to run as an off-tank in some vet trials with the exception of some flex sets/moves like Lord Warden, DefStance, Vigor (if I swapped Powerful Assault), for Ritual of Retribution and etc. Tank you for any feedback! &#x200B; [https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Special:EsoBuildEditor?id=234990](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Special:EsoBuildEditor?id=234990)	elderscrollsonline
My neighbor is having loud sex with tinder dates. How can I report her to the authorities?	Last night I was lying in bed at around 8pm masturbating to videos of Dr Fauci talking about continued lockdowns when I heard my neighbor having loud sex. It completely threw me out of my session, so I was pretty angry, but then I got even more angry when I realized that she lives alone - so she must have invited a guest over!! I know she's a big user of tinder, so it was probably someone from tinder or grindr or some kind of app!! Fucking thot. I can't believe she's having intimate bodily contact with other people during this crisis. It's bad enough that she's rubbing the fact that she has regular sex in my face, so to do this is just beyond the pale. Doesn't she realize that this virus is deadly, and that by bringing her disgusting man sluts up into our apartment complex that she's exposing me and everyone in the building to this deadly disease? I leave my apartment once or twice a week (usually to throw my piss jugs down the chute) and I cringe to know that I could have breathed the same air as this person! I hear COVID can last on any surface for weeks, what if he also touched the garbage chute door?? I'm literally shaking with rage as I type this. Something needs to be done. What can I do? There must be some COVID authorities that can take care of this for me, surely? Maybe someone can come and rough her up a bit, or maybe threaten her with violence? Weld her door shut? Can someone help?	CoronavirusCirclejerk
Great apps for Mirroring for Android	&#x200B; I just thought of sharing since I found it useful. I am the type of user that explores a lot of things. I download apps more often to see how can I mirror my phone to a much wider screen Well lately I found out some apps that you can consider using to do so. By the way, I watch movies and play games available on mobile devices on my TV and PC. Here is the list. 1. ApowerMirror ApowerMirror is a desktop app that works across all platform devices. This includes PC, TV and of course mobile devices. What's more with the app? It can record the screen activity while you are mirroring, annotate, and even capture your screen. Also, it has the capability to control your mobile device on your PC. The only thing that won't be transferred on your PC is the sound. 2. Screen Mirror The next tool is a free web-based app. You can access this anywhere. You just have to have a browser compatible with it and scan the Qr code. That being said, you need your phone and your PC connected under the same Wi-fi network. 3. Wireless Projection (Built-in) Many Android users probably see the benefit of having a Huawei Device. The wireless projection feature along with the Huawei Share feature allows you to connect your TV and your phone without connecting to a Wi-Fi server. How do I know? I use it my self. Am I bluffing? Of course not! It is one of the great features Huawei has. However, Huawei share is only available on the latest software version.	androidapps

Reasons why I keep going	I started working out again and go hiking a lot. Right now I don¬¥t have the excuse anymore that drinking will destroy any progress anyway. I also improved my nutrition and lost quite some weight. Noticing it in the mirror and also hearing compliments from co-workers feels damn good :) . Another huge benefit is that organ pain stopped almost completely, and my heart doesn¬¥t feel like it¬¥s gonna fail any second anymore. Brain fog is almost gone. My memory was really bad when drinking almost daily, this has improved a lot. I even started to remember things I thought I had long forgotten, things before I became an alcoholic. Sleep has improved drastically. I still have trouble falling asleep, but I don¬¥t wake up 5 times every night covered in sweat. Instead, I can sleep through 5-7 hours. I have a doctors appointment in a couple of days to check out my blood levels (first one in years). I am scared of the results, but as I have read somewhere on this subreddit before: **Quitting alcohol doesn¬¥t solve your problems, it allows you to take care of your problems.**	stopdrinking

Why I'm riding in the road	"Dear asshole who yelled at me, here are many reasons I might be riding in the road. * there is broken glass or other debris in the bike lane, the bike lanes commonly have junk in them you would not want to ride over (or which might be dangerous) * someone has parked in the bike lane or stationed something in the bike lane, trust me when I say that the bike lane is always the first part of the road to be blocked by something or someone (trash cans, rideshare, orange cones, improperly parked vehicles, ...) * there are cars parked reaaaaaal close to the bike lane and I'm worried someone might open their door and send me head over heels. Usually I just keep my eyes peeled but if a car has tinted windows, or it's a truck, or my spidey sense tingles, I may move out of the bike lane * there's a big curb or ditch or hedge or something on the side of the road, I can't ride right next to something where if I swerve 6"" to the right I'll fall in a hole or hit a curb. Not usually a problem with actual bike lanes, but if there's no bike lane, this can be a real issue Trust me when I say, I want nothing less than to back up angry drivers behind me, so if I'm riding in the roadway I'm going to give you as much space as I can, or else get out of the roadway ASAP. Thanks, please don't yell at me any more."	SeattleWA

German Guy, 21 looking for new pals to kill some time	Hello my name is Johannes (obviously) and I am looking for some new friends to get over my boredom. I've never tried to make friends over the internet before and I think you never lived in 21th century without trying that out. So here I am. Some information about me: I am working a full time job in a office, I would say it is my dream job and I am quite a career dude so I am working a lot. When I am not working I spend some time with gaming and if you are a gamer too that would be great but if not that's no problem. I am also reading a lot which I have re explored some weeks ago. My favorite music genre is Hip-Hop, but I am listening to Philharmonic, Trap and Electro too. I am also informed about the actual politic's in my Country and the important stuff in the world and if you want to discuss politic's or other sensible topics I am very open to this I would also love to talk to you about some deep stuff. However this Post is flaired with Ghostfree so I will answer to your Message but if i'ts just a Hi you will got a Hi back I hate it to carry conversation's just on my back and I will rarely do it so please be able to answer more 1 Word in our conversations. I also don't care about you'r Gender, political site or sexuality just be a cool and chilled person. Please forgive my grammatical mistakes I am obviously not a native speaker and I don't use English often. &#x200B; I look Forward to hear from you!	MakeNewFriendsHere

Need a magic shop for your campaign, don't know how to calculate travel time? Here's a website I SERIOUSLY reccomend.	http://5emagic.shop is a website I stumbled on about a couple of hours ago and it has already revolutionized how I write things. I'm not affiliated in any way with this site but it's so god damn good I really want people to use it. 5emagic lets you create magic shops, generates teleportation circle graphics as well as wizard spellbooks, detect magic aura colours, reincarnation tables, calculate travel time, and calculate Bounty/Rewards for optional quests! And that's just the *free* version, you can get more options if you subscribe to their Patreon! Seriously check them out, I'm having a blast experimenting.	DnD
The Fool Card	Anyone been reading or read through the fool card? It's not done just yet but literally couldn't get through the first 10 chapters because I was actually so annoyed with the main character. It's a great story I'm 100% sure. I just couldn't deal with how annoying she is. The fact is, is that I've met women like her, I've KNOWN people like her. Which is why is so triggering lol.

Ending of Apokolips War	I really liked this movie I‚Äôm just a little confused on the ending. Couldn‚Äôt have Barry just reset the timeline whenever he felt like it? Why did he have to wait until the end of the movie to do it? I get it was a last resort but I don‚Äôt see why because the world was shit throughout the whole movie, it‚Äôs hard to think that he went back to change reality when the Atlantans and Amazons were at war but didn‚Äôt do the same when Darkseid Knuckle Fucked Earth to shreds and only even thought about it when Constantine told him at the end? Also I guess they all die at the end? Like their timeline just fades and they‚Äôre at peace with it? Or are they going to be reincarnated onto a different life somehow? Movie was really good though.

Any way to bind throttle or forward/reverse thrust to the alt control scheme?	Right now I have, for the standard scheme, throttle up (R1) and down (L1). Which works across both schemes. I want to bind throttle axis or thrust forward/reverse to the right stick up/down in alt controls for better combat controls. As the options menu is setup now, unfortunately, if I make that bind to the stick it will apply to both schemes. The problem seems to be that in the alt section there‚Äôs no nested throttle controls. Am I boned or am I missing something?	ElitePS
I joined a new app for working various gigs. They seemed nonsensical at first, but now I realize the terrible truth behind the tasks I was given	I woke up early one Sunday morning, grabbed my phone, and began scrolling through the countless notifications I‚Äôd received during the night. It was my morning ritual, and I worked to sort through various texts, social media notifications, and emails. However, as I was doing so, one particular notification stuck out. It was an email from a company I‚Äôd never heard of ‚Äì Acheron Industries. **An Offer You Can‚Äôt Pass Up!** the subject read. Curious, I opened it. >*Dear Joshua Lowe,* > >*First and foremost, congratulations on being one of the select few to receive this offer! This is an exclusive position that we don‚Äôt extend to just anyone. Acheron Industries has just launched a new app called* ***Infernium****.* > >*Are you strapped for cash? Or maybe you just want to make a little on the side? Well, Infernium gives you plenty of money to burn. Our app is an invitation-only program that allows you to receive offers for easy gigs that pay extremely well. We‚Äôve received amazing feedback about the app, and our current users are raving about the lucrative amounts of money they‚Äôre making for simple jobs.* > >*If you‚Äôre interested in applying to be one of our exclusive users, then download Infernium in the app store and enter the following code when prompted:* **JLOWE18** > >*We look forward to working with you,* > >*Acheron Industries.* ‚ÄúFucking spam,‚Äù I muttered to myself, immediately moving to delete the email. However, I stopped just before pressing the little trash icon. My job didn‚Äôt pay all that well, and I‚Äôd been looking for an opportunity to make some extra cash. Maybe it was worth a look. Intrigued, I opened the app store and looked it up. It had a perfect 5-star rating, and all of the reviewers claimed to be making more from the app than they would at a full-time job. I suspected that they were fake, but the reviews weren‚Äôt rife with the spelling errors and repetitive phrasing one normally finds with sketchy product reviews. They all seemed to be from real people. I shrugged and downloaded the app. Upon opening it, I was immediately prompted to enter a code. Glancing back at the email I‚Äôd received, I entered the one they‚Äôd provided and was granted access. A new screen opened which asked me to create an account and provide my PayPal address. I was still skeptical but entered my information anyway. It didn‚Äôt ask for anything particularly personal, so what was the harm? Once I‚Äôd submitted my information, I was asked to accept their terms and conditions. I clicked the attachment and saw that the file was nearly thirty pages long. Deciding not to waste my time picking through legal jargon, I simply clicked *Accept*. The page disappeared, and the words ‚ÄúWe will contact you shortly‚Äù floated on a plain black background. I sighed and put my phone down. Maybe it was just a scam to get my contact information so they could sell it to some third party. I doubted anything would come of it. To my surprise, my phone rang less than a minute later. The caller ID displayed a 1-800 number that I didn‚Äôt recognize. ‚ÄúHi, is this Joshua Lowe?‚Äù a professional sounding man asked when I picked up the phone. ‚ÄúYes, it is,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThis is Liam with Acheron Industries. I‚Äôd first like to thank you for joining our new startup Infernium. I‚Äôll be your personal task manager for the app.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúhow exactly does this work?‚Äù ‚ÄúStraight to the point, I see. I like it.‚Äù Liam spoke quickly but annunciated clearly, sounding as if he‚Äôd done this a million times. ‚ÄúBasically, I‚Äôll text you the details for upcoming gigs. Typically, they need to be completed within a certain timeframe, so we‚Äôll give you as much heads-up as possible. Once you receive the details of the job, you simply have to carry it out. Payments will be sent to you via PayPal shortly after completion of the task. Aside from that, there‚Äôs nothing more you need to do.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù I asked, still suspicious of the app. It all seemed a little shady, especially since they randomly reached out to me via email. ‚ÄúPretty much. I will warn you that the tasks may seem strange and ambiguous. But I assure you that you won‚Äôt be doing anything illegal. The first two gigs are optional, so, if you feel uncomfortable doing them, you‚Äôre free to refuse. However, if you reject any subsequent tasks, then you‚Äôll be terminated as per the terms of service.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat sounds‚Ä¶ fine.‚Äù The idea of being able to reject my first two gigs made it seem at least a little more legitimate. ‚ÄúPerfect! I‚Äôll text you with details when the next gig becomes available.‚Äù Liam hung up without another word, and I was left wondering what kind of tasks they would ask me to do. I didn‚Äôt have to wonder long, because I received a text only two hours later. **Buy a bag of Peanut M&Ms. At 3 PM today, leave the package on a bench near the swings at Jaywood Park. No further action required. Payout: $300. Reply YES to accept.** I stared at the text in utter bewilderment. Three-hundred dollars to leave a bag of M&Ms at a park? What kind of gig was this? I figured I‚Äôd be buying groceries for people or helping old ladies move their couch. Maybe it was some kind of promotional thing. The task was strange to say the least, but I didn‚Äôt see any harm in it. I picked up my phone and responded ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù At that point, all I had to do was wait until 3 PM rolled around. I wondered how they would even verify if I‚Äôd completed the task. They hadn‚Äôt asked me to send a picture or any other kind of proof. But I figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt to give it a try. Jaywood Park was only a few blocks down the road. That afternoon, I stopped by the convenience store and bought a bag of Peanut M&Ms. Then I drove to the park and found a bench near the swings. I wasn‚Äôt sure how they wanted it exactly, so I just left it in the center of the bench with the label facing outward. I glanced around to see a mother sitting across the park and a couple kids playing on the swings. Shrugging, I got back in my car and left. When I got home, I looked at my phone and nearly dropped it in surprise. Acheron Industries had sent me three-hundred dollars via PayPal. My jaw dropped at the sight of the payment. How did they even know that I‚Äôd completed the task? Were they just assuming I had since it was so simple? I tried to put the thoughts out of my mind. If all the tasks were this easy, then I was bound to make plenty of money from the app. Hell, it was practically miraculous. At that moment, I decided it best not to ask questions. There was no way I could turn down this kind of money. Over the next several weeks, I received more and more esoteric tasks. They came pretty much every other day, and they were all equally confusing. At one point, I was asked to spray-paint the words ‚ÄúDO IT‚Äù on the rocky shore near a local river. I thought that it might be considered vandalism but figured the $500 payout was well worth the risk. Other tasks included laying a brick in the center of a random sidewalk, leaving a $200 tip for a waitress, and misplacing a book in a library. At one point, I was given the description of a man, including what he was wearing, and asked to find him at a local bar. Once I found him, I was supposed to buy him a few drinks then leave. All the tasks were like that ‚Äì strange little jobs that seemed to have no discernible goal. They confused me, and I often questioned what their purpose was, but I soon stopped caring. Watching the money roll in became addictive. It was almost like a game. I had to do stupid little side quests and was given absurd monetary rewards. At this rate, I could probably save enough money to retire by the time I was forty. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Then I received a text that left me absolutely bewildered. **At 5 PM today, find a man named Oliver McCoy near the corner of 3rd Street and Cedar Road ‚Äì Average height, white male, gray hair, jeans and a gray jacket. Purchase a small rosary and hand it to him. Say nothing. No further action required. Payout: $10,000**. I stared at the text for what felt like an eternity. Ten-thousand dollars? The gigs had been lucrative before, but this was completely insane. I glanced at the clock and saw that it was three-thirty. I didn‚Äôt have much time, and I didn‚Äôt have a rosary either. I immediately got in my car and drove to several stores. None of them had rosaries, but I finally found a small religious shop that sold them. I bought a cheap plastic one and raced to the location specified in the text, arriving there with only two minutes to spare. I parked and stepped out of my car to see a man pacing back and forth on the corner. He seemed agitated and was muttering to himself. Cautiously, I approached, trying to get a good look at him. He matched the description I‚Äôd been given in the text. ‚ÄúOliver McCoy?‚Äù I asked. He stopped and stared at me, his eyes wild. There was a frenzied look about him, and it appeared he hadn‚Äôt showered in weeks. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I reached into my pocket, produced the rosary, and handed to him. As soon as he saw it, tears welled up in his eyes. He took the rosary with shaky hands then immediately began to finger the beads and pray. Without another word, I left and returned to my car. When I got home, I sat on my bed and watched my phone, anxiously waiting for the next payment. One hour passed, then another. It had never taken this long for a payment to come through. Finally, my phone dinged and a notification appeared. Ten-thousand dollars had been sent to my account. I nearly shouted in joy. It was too good to be true. That night, I ordered a lavish amount of food and spent the evening relaxing. Now was a time for celebration. I turned on the TV and began flicking through the channels, trying to find something interesting to watch. As I was doing so, I came across a breaking news story. I flicked past it, but ended up returning, wondering what had happened. A local politician, Wyatt Stokes, had been assassinated. The news sullied my evening, and I almost turned the channel again. Stokes had been a good man, loved and respected by the local community. Many people thought he had a good chance at becoming president one day. Some had even likened him to Jesus. Apparently, someone had shot him while he was making a speech that evening. The newscasters claimed to have footage of the perpetrator being arrested. My drink fell from my hand and splattered across the floor as soon as they began to play the video. It was Oliver McCoy, the man I‚Äôd met only a few hours ago. As the police attempted to subdue him, he waved around the rosary, claiming that an angel had given him a sign to kill Wyatt Stokes. An icy feeling settled in my gut as the camera zoomed in on his frenzied eyes. Had I somehow been involved in this? Surely, it was just a coincidence. I tried to push the thought away, but a strange foreboding settled over me. Grabbing my laptop, I began searching for recent news. I looked up the name of the park where I‚Äôd left those M&Ms only to discover that a five-year-old had died there from an allergic reaction. Apparently, he had a peanut allergy and had torn into an unopened pack of candy he found without knowing what it contained. Shakily, I searched the name of the bar where I‚Äôd been sent to buy a random man drinks. A news story appeared detailing how a girl had been killed in a drunk driving accident near the bar. Feeling as if all the air had been sucked out of my lungs, I clicked on the article. The top of the page displayed a mugshot of the driver. It was the same man I‚Äôd bought drinks for. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said to myself, my voice barely above a whisper. I researched further and found an article about a local suicide. Some man had thrown himself from a local bridge. I recognized the location. The bridge crossed almost directly over the place where I‚Äôd spray-painted the words ‚ÄúDO IT.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be.‚Äù I felt as if I was in a daze. Had all of my tasks ended like this? Had they all been the first toppled domino in a horrible chain of events? I immediately picked up my phone and called Liam. ‚ÄúI want out,‚Äù I said as soon as he picked up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù ‚ÄúI want out. I don‚Äôt want to be part of the Infernium thing anymore.‚Äù The professionalism in Liam‚Äôs voice seemed to disappear, and he almost sounded snide. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôs possible,‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done. I quit.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is no quitting Infernium.‚Äù His voice was cold. ‚Äú[You belong to us now](https://reddit.com/r/travisliebert).‚Äù	nosleep

I mean, obviously I‚Äôll know, but I don‚Äôt think I care anymore. And yes, I know the answer is yes... I guess I just want someone to enable me, lol.	stopdrinking

Considering the quarantine and my plans for a new setup within a week or so, I think i‚Äôd love this idea. Is the community still alive and, seeing as how niche the game is, has it been overhauled enough throughout the years for it to garner attention?	Wizard101

Tempurpedic ProAdapt vs Breeze	"I am trying to decided which mattress to purchase (Between ProAdapt or one of the Breeze Models). I am mostly a side sleeper with back problems my girl is mostly a back sleeper therefore we decided on the medium firmness mattress to accommodate both of us. Reading reviews, I've seen most say that memory foam mattresses sleep hot which makes me feel that I should get a Breeze model. The issue I am having is the Breeze feels a bit more ""stiff"" due to the cooling layer and I feel like it would not feel as comfortable throughout the night. Does anyone have any experience with both of these mattresses and provide some input on which one might be a better option."	Mattress
My friend started a relationship with a guy who sexual assaulted me and she knows about it.	So to make it short: a former really 'good' friend of mine sexual assaulted me when I was sleeping 3 years ago(I woke up and stopped it). I since learned he done something similar many times to other girls... I learned that a good friend was secretly dating him last year. We all went to the same uni at the time. I told her about what he done and a she stopped seeing him. He charmed his way back in and now they are a couple and I havent seen her for almost a year because of that. The assaults happened before she knew him, so I know thats what she is telling herself. Pretending it didn't happen and doesn't want to face facts. It is also unfair that she should suffer from the consequences from what he has done...She is such a kind person and he is one of the most fucked persons I have ever meet and I really want whats best for her. I can understand it is difficult for her, when she loves him. I miss her and I think it such a sad sad situation. She reached out for meeting for coffee , but I don't know if I can, when we have to 'pretend' . Any advice?	relationship_advice

Returning to the game: what do I need to know?	So I'm looking to get back into the game after not playing for years (the newest card I have is from 2013).

[40][Analysis] _______'s Best Pitch to the Jury in FTC	With the F3 pretty much 100% confirmed to be Tony, Natalie, and Michele, there are solid predictions that Tony will get the majority of votes, Natalie will get some EOE votes, and Michele *might* get a few votes, if any. Is there any way Michele can come back from being a 0-2 vote finalist and capture a few more votes? It's highly unlikely she wins, but she may be able to scrape a few votes away from Tony and Natalie. I hope she brings up pre-game relationships as a key point in her FTC speech. As Survivor fans/players know, having a solid pre-game partner or group to play with in the game can be a tremendous advantage, like Tony and Sarah likely have. The jury probably realizes this advantage because (1) they've played before, and (2) a lot of them likely pre-gamed. However, I think it was mentioned that Michele had some sort of pre-game alliance with Nick and Yul, so this might not be a very strong point. Michele's game has been pretty similar to her Ka√¥h R≈çng game, emphasizing her social relationships and navigating different groups to get her to the end. Hardly as flashy as Tony's, or even Natalie's games. What's her best pitch to the jury to come out of this season as a zero vote finalist? Also, fun fact: Michele will be the only player this season to never be voted out of Survivor.	SpoiledSurvivor

[Poetry] Adam and Eve [Misc]	I haven't been able to get this one out of my head. There are so, so many layers of vulnerability, violence, frustration, loneliness, temptation, the list goes on. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this too--love it, hate it, agree/disagree with it, relate to it. It definitely struck a peculiar chord that resonated with me deeply, albeit from the perspective of the male gender. **TRIGGER WARNING - Abuse, domestic violence** >Is a man just an animal, and is a woman not an animal? > >Is the name of the animal power? > >Is it true that the man wishes to see the woman > >hurt with her own pleasure > >and the woman wishes to see the expression on the man's face > >of someone falling from great height, > >that the woman thrills with the power of her weakness > >and the man is astonished by the weakness of his power?

Disabled Veterans Unite!...?	Disabled vets what have you done to replace your income? I worry about having a roof over my head every day. I also am losing my health physically and may not even be able to work in a few short years. I‚Äôm by no means a frail woman. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and built pretty well. I was a Seabee Welder and loved every hard bit of it. But due to the training, and leaving things unchecked because going to medical was frowned upon, I have these physical conditions that the VA has decided to pay me versus fixing. I feel that I will not be able to do even the most minor things at this rate and I‚Äôm only 31. I‚Äôm not looking for a get rich scheme. Just something I can do at home possibly.	PTSDCombat

Travel Photographer Synology NAS Question	I recently had a hard drive with 3 months of images die on me and I'm over it. So I've been researching NAS and Synology keeps coming up. I'm looking at the Synology 4 bay NAS DiskStation DS918+ as my first one. But I have a big question regarding cloud. I'm looking for something where I can leave it at home connected to the net and access it while I'm in another country. Is that possible? How do I find out if a NAS has this support? The spec sheets are basically listing things I have no idea about. Thanks for any help.	synology
Did Forest Gump Play Disc Golf?	I watched Forest Gump again last night from start to finish. In the opening scene of he tucks the feather into a book (Curious George?) in his suitcase. In the top of the suitcase, held in place by the net, looks to be a golf disc? A driver at that. I can't imagine why. Unless Hanks or the props guy is a disc fan and was slipping in a personal bit. The thing is flat and round. There's a tube of toothpaste next to it, but I can't think of an item of personal hygiene that would look like that. I'm pretty certain Savannah didn't have a disc golf course at the time the movie took place. (We used to play in a town park.) Edit: Of course it's the paddle. After disc popped in my head, it didn't leave room for anything else.	movies
Finally lucid ‚Äî and my dad wasn‚Äôt having any of it	So I finally had a lucid dream. I was writing a story on a piece of paper and eventually wrote out: ‚ÄúYou are in a dream.‚Äù I proceeded to run around my house out of excitement. I told my dad (in the dream) that I finally recognized that I was dreaming, and he brushed me off and said, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you know that the whole time?‚Äù And then I woke up. When I wrote down that I was in a dream I felt this crazy rush in my head. It felt like I snapped into the dream all at once, but everything afterwards happened within seconds and then I woke up.

Looking for 2 build reccomendations (SL 30 and SL 120)	Hi! I always played souls pvp but never dived much into build creation. After a couple years of not playing it, I bought recently a copy of DS3 in ps4, as I always played on PC. But now the meta has changed a lot and I don't know what is a decent option to do pvp at low level like 30 at the Forest or Farron's Keep. Can someone recommend me a build for that level and other for SL 120? My only planned build is SL 60 STR using BK Greatsword, so maybe the lvl 30 build should be STR based too. Thanks in advance! PS: Just noticed the typo on the title :(	DkS3Builds
Sugar free Jello... pros and cons	"5'6"" 28m 260lbs here. I've always had a sweet tooth and have found myself turning towards sugar free jello here lately. I know that artificial sweeteners aren't good for you, but I'm wanting to lose quite a bit of weight and obtain a healthier lifestyle. I'm just now starting to try to get more active and start walking several times a week. In terms of sweets/cheats, I'm not going to be able to give them up. I'll be honest. My issue is portion control and I feel like for the most part jello is a guilt free item. But what exactly are the pros and cons of sugar free jello? Will this have a negative impact on my goals or is it a better alternative to mindlessly eating snacks? I'm new here, but already feel better seeing how supportive some of these communities are. Any tips or suggestions are very much appreciated."	loseit

Succesful Nebido story	Currently in the last few days of my third 1.000mg testosterone undecenoate (Nebido) shot. The protocol that my doctor has prescribed me is a 1.000mg shot every 7 weeks. That is around 142 mg of testosterone every week. Before I have used Androgel with no succes. Just a slight increase in libido but no morning wood. Fatigue was still present. The reason i started TRT in the first place is because of low libido, no morning erections, social anxiety, concentration issues (i was diagnosed with ADHD when i was 8 years old). Currently testing wether i have Klinefelters syndrome or not. Nebido works truly amazing for me. You have to be patient with it because the first shot did little to nothing for me. But right when i took the second shot i experienced the benefits for around 2/3 weeks. Now I am on my third shot and I experienced the benefits for almost fully 6 weeks. I experienced these benefits from TRT: \- I lost some bodyfat, but that is also from being in a caloric deficit. \- All my fatigue problems are gone! I dont need a nap anymore around 4 pm. That changed my lifestyle a lot! \- Everyday morning wood. Every. Day. \- Very high libido. I get horny around 4-5 times a day. \- Harder erections. My girlfriend also told me that my penis appears bigger when erect. \- Some increase in beard growth. The hair on my cheeks is also thicker. I know people have bad experiences with Nebido. That is because the standard protocol of 12 weeks. The optimal protocol for most people is around 6-7-8 weeks, though i dont recommed the 6 weeks protocol. It builds up a lot of testosterone on the long run -> long term problems. Feel free to ask my any questions regarding my TRT experience! I live in The Netherlands by the way so Sustanon, Androgel & Nebido are my only options.	Testosterone

Ding-Dong Ditch	It was a late Friday night when my older brother Mike dared me to ding-dong ditch Mr. Murphy‚Äôs house. Being the innocent younger sibling, I was always easily persuaded. I wanted nothing more in life than to earn my brother‚Äôs respect, so I accepted the dare. It was the first time I had ever ding-dong ditched. Mike agreed to accompany me because I was nervous. We quietly walked across the street, easily hidden by the darkness of the night. A full harvest moon hovered in the sky directly above the rooftop to Mr. Murphy‚Äôs house. I could feel my heart beating faster as we neared the porch. Mr. Murphy‚Äôs car was parked in the driveway, but the house was pitch dark. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be scared.‚Äù Mike whispered. ‚ÄúRing the doorbell.‚Äù My finger trembled as I pressed the dimly lit button. As soon as I heard the ding echo from inside, I turned and sprinted as fast as I could. Mike was waiting in the driveway and as I passed, like trickster older brothers do, he lifted his foot and tripped me to the ground. I laid flat on the cold pavement. The burning pain of skinned extremities was numbed by the rush of panic induced adrenaline. With each escaping step, I could hear Mike laughing his way home. Suddenly, as I tried to stand to my feet, the porch light turned on and I could hear the front door creek open. I had to quickly find a place to hide so I rolled underneath Mr. Murphy‚Äôs parked car. I held my breath. Fearful I would be found. It was silent, until I heard the most horrifying, vicious scream coming from the darkness beyond. Thumping footsteps approached, accompanied by the sound of scratching along the cold concrete. THUMP. SCRATCH. THUMP. SCRATCH. Louder and louder, the footsteps became with each advancing stride. As I peered out from beneath the car, the light of the full moon revealed two large, rigid feet, covered in long dark hair, descending into view. Sharp nails protruded from the toes, like monstrous claws conceived from a nightmare. A deep growl and midnight howl expelled from the larynx of the beast. I was able to escape that night, but Mike was not as fortunate. His distant laughter culminated into an agonizing cry, when he was caught by Mr. Murphy. That was the first and last time I ding-dong ditched. It was partly by choice, but primarily because my brother was no longer around to dare me to do so. I stay as far away from Mr. Murphy‚Äôs house as possible. Especially on nights when the moon is full.	shortscarystories
How do you keep your circulation going when in the operating room?	Hi everyone. I'm new to Reddit and I hope I'm doing this right. I'm a med student in Germany and have recently had my first surgery experiences in orthopaedics. The surgeons let me stand in the sterile area and sometimes even assist and I found it incredibly interesting. I could honestly imagine to work in this field in a few years. I just had one problem: dizziness, sometimes even syncopation. It didn't matter that much because I wasn't needed, but it shouldn't happen on a regular basis when you're a surgeon... So now I wonder if it is at all possible for me to enter a surgical field, or if I should rather pursue a career that doesn't involve operating... Do you have any general advice, experiences or opinions on this? Anything will be much appreciated, because I'm genuinely confused about what I could or should do in the next few years to come.	medizzy

‚ÄúBuck up, son, have some courage‚Äù says random YouTube stranger to a frightened teen worried for his grandmother‚Äôs safety.	Ok, happened last night. I was watching a video on YT, something related to COVID, and I expressed in the comments how I wish people would take this virus more seriously and comply with social distancing. Of course I got multiple replies from people about why we should forget all this worry and why it isn‚Äôt as bad as it sounds. And, well, I decided to engage and argue back. Oops. Get into it with this random dude for a while, civil discussion, not the angry people argument. But eventually to make my case, I explain about my grandmother. She is 86 years old. If she gets this virus, her chances of making it are significantly lower than those of a young, healthy person. It can still happen, she can still make it, but chances are quite slim. I told him I was scared because my uncle doesn‚Äôt listen to us, and he has a sore throat and yet is STILL hanging out with her every day. I told this stranger I‚Äôm scared that if she gets the virus, she could very well die, and this is why we need to take this stuff seriously. And he replied with: ‚ÄúBuck up, son, have some courage. Life will be so much more fruitful if you do.‚Äù Normally a nice sentiment, but right now? What the actual fuck? He talks about he himself is in an at-risk age category but he doesn‚Äôt worry because the virus is just one of many things that could kill him. That elderly people like my Grandma are going to die anyways because of their age. My grandma has a lot of life left in her. You wouldn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs 86 if you saw her. Don‚Äôt anyone ever tell me we don‚Äôt need to social distance because elderly people are going to die anyways. Oh yeah, and then he closed out his multi-paragraph response by saying I need to go listen to a podcast episode with Monty Python about looking on the bright side. Life pro-tip: don‚Äôt waste your time arguing with internet strangers. It‚Äôs not worth it. Life pro-tip 2: don‚Äôt go and tell a distressed person to ‚Äúbuck up‚Äù or ‚Äúhave some courage.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt work. TL;DR: I tried arguing with a stranger on YouTube about why we need to take this virus seriously. Oops. I explained how I‚Äôm scared for my 86-year-old grandmother and how if she gets this virus, her chances of making it are pretty low. He responded with ‚Äúbuck up‚Äù and ‚Äúhave some courage‚Äù and said she is going to die soon anyways. I‚Äôm never gonna argue with internet strangers again. Waste of my time. Stay home. Stop the spread. Stay healthy. Flatten the curve. Don‚Äôt do this for me. Do this so that not another person had to die of something preventable. God bless you and your families.	teenagers

Would uploading this fic be offensive?	This might be a weird question, but I want to hear people's opinions on it. Since 2017, I have been working on a particular Pokemon fanfic that is currently unpublished because it required such a large amount of work. I'm talking over 160 Fakemon (complete with Pokedex entries, Abilities and movesets), a brand new region and an entire cast of OCs kind of big. Just last month, I got to a point where I was ready to start writing...and then I realised that one of the Legendary Pokemon represented disease...and we're in a pandemic... So...is now not a good time? Would you guys be offended if something like this popped up during a pandemic? When I came up with this fic and put so much work into it, I had no idea that the world would face something like this by the time I was about to post it, but I've put so much work into this, and I'll be so frustrated if about 3 years of hard work goes down the drain. I keep thinking about how much backlash a TV channel in my country got when they played Contagion just as the virus started to spread. How long would it be safe to leave this after the pandemic ends? Maybe I should just write the fanfiction and post it when I'm finished. That'll be, like, 6 years down the line, based on past experiences with my writing speed (I'm joking, of course).	FanFiction

Looking for my first decent quality chef knife	Dear all, I cook a lot, and my knife is just not doing job. It is a tefal chef knife for 20 euros and I need something better. I'm considering the wusthof classic ikon or the global g2, but I'm open to other suggestions. Some information that might be useful. My hands are on the small side, but not to small. I'm more of a shopper than a rocker in the way I cut. I'm vegan thus i will not be cutting chicken. The hardest thing I cut is probably butternut squash, and pumpkins. I have no idea how to sharp a knife and an I have an hard time taking care of them. I live in Portugal Europe thus not every single knife is easy to order I can get the w√ºsthof classic ikon with an iron and a paring knife for 150 euros.

Just want to add my 2 eurocents	I want to review Weekend League - from perspective of european casual player. Last week i was locked down due to covid so i grinded solos and achieved ~96 ovr team. This week i decided to try PvP (yea i previously played like 5 pvp in season mode when i was <85, thats all its my 1st madden). Well, i ended 10-11 (no time for last 4 games). It was exciting experience. Pvp is completly different from solos. It gives more fun when you do stops, and pure satisfaction when i score (frankly i 'know' how to use one formation). Ofc Moss cheese is unhealthy, same as 1 play Dickerson/Sanders rushing td. Also i learned a lot, especially how to operate on defence. Definitelly i'll play next week. Just wanted to share, coz noone here cares about am. football. P.S. all i want to aske ea for is better servers coz its unpossible to kick fg/ make good kickoffs from east europe.	MaddenUltimateTeam

People need to stop taking pictures of people in public and complaining how nobody cares about the coronavirus.	Im so tired of seeing people take pictures of others who dared to leave their house, posting it on social media and complaining, just focus on your life, stop being so concerned with other people, it will not affect you if a stranger leaves their house, what will affect you is if you leave the house. If your that pissed off because other people chose to go outside, then stop being a hypocrite, its common sense that if your complaining and taking photos of people without consent, then clearly you are part of that group of people. It is none of your business that others go outside, its not your life to decide what people do, i‚Äôm not saying that its a good thing that people are not quarantined, but taking photos of people, complaining in social media will not change shit. I don‚Äôt care who disagrees or downvotes, its my opinion. For those who wont bother reading it, stop taking pictures of people, stop complaining, and stay home if your that afraid. Honest to god i didn‚Äôt know that people actually thought that once the lockdown was lifted people would actually stay in quarantine.	TrueOffMyChest

Building a PC for streaming console content	Hi recently a friend asked me for some help in regards of streaming. Because of the quarantine he aparently got money to spare an decided to splurge on streaming equipment. He got: a Streamdeck an elgato capture card (which states it needs a NVidia 10xx) usb-mic and -headset the problem now is he only got an old pc from work so no USB 3 which both the streamdeck and the capture card state the need of. Also in the Programm of the capture card states that his Radeon HD6450 is currently used or has an insufficient driver. Now since he is on the roll he decided to buy or assemble a new PC. He alloted around 1000‚Ç¨ for that since he won't need it for anything else except maybe some excel an browsing. Since i am a full on PC-Gamer i have no clue what kinda Hardware he needs to stay in the loop for a bit. My first step would have been the GPU since its the only thing i know at least a minimum and i would have recommended a GTX 16xx since the capture card doesn't specify an AMD alternative. Any help would be much appreciated. Also this is my first post on reddit so be kind guys.	buildapc
Read a file into memory	For some Cuda/C++ processing I need to read rather big text files with integers and complex numbers. But this is only a temporary solution; Later the data will come via Flink. For now I use textfiles for Performance testing. I created my own sturct into which i read the data line by line. For that I overloaded the read operator of ifstream. But that isn‚Äôt that fast at 0.000797ms/line. I have enough RAM for the whole file, is there a way to first read the file into memory and then access it with a ifstream (or similar stream)? Or is that already happening? How can I efficiently parallize this to ~75 Threads? Any Ideas? Thanks!	cpp_questions
Explaining maths through real world examples, can you be creative?	So I‚Äôm homeschooling my son due to corona and I notice that he keeps making the same mistake, when asked to convert 2.1 hours into minutes he sees this as 2 hours and 10 minutes and hence a total of 130minutes. I‚Äôve tried to find a way to explain this but I end up down a rabbit hole converting decimals into fractions and ‚Äúfollowing a set of rules.‚Äù I‚Äôm trying my best to give my son a relational understanding of maths and so I believe it would be best to give him a fun and memorable example to understand that 2.1 hours is in fact 126 minutes. I don‚Äôt know if this is the correct place to post this but I wanted to see if any creative mathematicians on here could help me to help my son understand. (He is 12 years old) Thanks in advance for any suggestions!	maths

Switches not working?	Hello, sorry if this is a dumb question but I just bought a home and don't really know where to start with this issue. I have double switches in the bedroom, one switch for fan and the other for the light on the fan. A few days ago, the fan switch stopped working. Then last night the light switch also stopped. I checked the breaker box outside and all looks ok. I reset that room anyway and still nothing. I also took off the switch plate and didn't see anything loose although no ground wires appear to be connected. What could the problem be? Thank you.	electrical

Faction-specific healing/revive particle effects?	I've noticed this a lot recently when watching some of the event twitch streams etc., but its also something that became apparent with the surge of recent content creator videos: **all healing effects are green**. For the sake of brevity - why?: * Green doesn't always align well with the factions from an immersion/art perspective * It makes for a bad distinction of friend vs. foe, especially during rezwars and/or if smoke is involved (is that an enemy resnade/healing nade?) **Proposal: Make all healing/revive particle effects faction-specific.** * this is already the case for shield bubbles (could be further emphasized for e.g. VS being more purple vs. NC), and it was done for the frag grenades * AOE heal, heal grenade/ revive nade etc. should follow the factions: red for TR, blue for NC, purple for VS * Optionally (don't know if feasible): The particle effects could follow the empire color settings the player uses instead (i.e. for those weirdos that play TR with blue friendly icons) *** Its a small QOL feature request, but I think it would add a lot for the distinction of the effects (gameplay, casting/commenting), and also add to the faction flavors. Sidenote: possibly smoke and/or flash effects could be faction-colored, too (so you know whom to thank/blame, and for smoke it may mask doritos a bit when spotted within).	Planetside
Stellaris Just Screwed Me in my 1st Play through lol	So I'm a console player and grabbed the game from game pass. Never played before but saw it was a 4x4, like sci fi and have had a on/off obsession with Civ since the 90's so gave it a go. Fast forward 25 hours and I'm in charge of a fairly prosperous space Civ. I play a fairly mellow style and in game year 2287 have never been in a war and have good relations with my neighbors. As a chilled player I have 2 fleets (for pirates) both at about 2.5k strength which I thought was fine. Now, out the blue, these A-Hole Fallen Empire dicks just declared war. So I order both fleets to the system that I can they're approaching. I then go to have a spy on the oncoming fleets (there's 2). One is 57.4K and the other is 52.7küòê So I'm doomed. I can see no possible outcome where I survive this insane mis match. I mean, tha F? How is this in anyway balanced? My fleet capacity is already 90/127 so it's not like it would even be possible to have a fleet that would equal a 10th of one of these guys fleets. Don't want to be gloomy but it seems all is lost. Or is there a glimmer of hope? Any bones experienced campaigners can throw me?	Stellaris

We instead got the useless ep 27 recap and boring ep 1 filler. They should have adapted chapter 3 instead of the filler episode and chapter 4 instead of the recap. The Ishval war arc should also be an episode longer, the Dublin arc should have an episode in plus as well , the Envy vs Ling and Lan Fan + Hohenheim scene with the robers should have been added too. So imo the series should have been 67 episodes long ( without the recap and filler)	FullmetalAlchemist
A Simple Addition to Playlist Vendors	"Tl;Dr at the end You've probably seen it, I've seen it; the consensus surrounding Zavala, Shaxx, and Drifter's inventories is that they've grown stale and could use a complete ""vendor refresh"". It's a sentiment that I can agree with, but I also realize that it'd need some diversion of resources on Bungie's part to pull off, so I'd like to put forth something simpler yet more satisfying, in my opinion. Seasonal Curated rolls. Now wait, you might be thinking, isn't that already the idea behind the Pinnacle/Ritual/Pursuit weapons today? Yes and no. Let's back up a bit. When Forsaken launched, every new weapon (i.e every weapon with a Forsaken sigil in its thumbnail) came with both a set of randomly rolled perks as well as a ""Curated"" roll - a version that came pre-masterworked with a particular stat and a fixed set of perks that the dev team felt meshed well with the gun. Not all of them felt necessarily like the ""God Roll"", and some missed the mark entirely (looking at you, Transfiguration), but they generally felt satisfying to use and often came with a set of perks that the base gun cannot roll with (ex. Age-old Bond with Fourth Time's the Charm + Rampage). As of this writing, only certain Forsaken-era weapons can actually drop Curated rolls, which you can see on sites like light.gg and they state ""Not all Curated rolls drop in-game"", which is a bit of a shame in my eyes, seeing as there are some pretty sweet rolls in the database itching to be released into the wild, like the Gambit shotgun, Parcel of Stardust: this bad boy has Full Choke, Assault Mag (which it can't roll naturally), Opening Shot, and Quickdraw. It also cannot drop naturally, but it could have an avenue into players' hands if we look two of its other Gambit weapon brothers; Trust and Bad Omens. These two are also Gambit weapons with Curated rolls that don't simply drop out in the wild, but can be acquired in-game...via Infamy resets. Now here's where I'm going with this; every season you could offer up ""new"" (Year 2 of course but just work with me here) Curated weapons from the Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit loot pools as aspirational content via Vanguard rank-ups and Valor/Infamy resets. Of course, some of the currently unused curated rolls are, for lack of a better descriptor, hot garbage (though the Gambit ones are honestly really solid for the most part). Luckily, Bungie has shown that they can easily alter curated rolls for weapons that already drop; they did it for Warden's Law, and I think they did it for Trust, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. It'd be simple enough to tweak the unused ones, certainly simpler than designing a ritual weapon. Tl;Dr, release Y2 Curated rolls as seasonal goals."	DestinyTheGame

How I turned the DM‚Äôs homophobia against him to defeat The Great Evil.	"To start with, a little disclaimer : as a girl, I had heard for years that the RP world was very straight man-centric and often misogynist, but I had never encountered that before. This specific DM was an unfortunate encounter which didn't deter me from continuing DND and other games with better quality people. It was a one-shot at a library event, with a bunch of strangers who were equally excited for a night of adventuring. A bunch of DMs presented their tables, and we got to pick which one we'd like. The one I chose was based on a fantasy cloak and dagger series by Pierre Pevel, with high dragons masquerading among humans to mess with politics. The combat system also relied on playing cards, which seemed really fresh and exciting. And it could have been, were it not for the DM. He had prepared characters for the players (good call for a oneshot) but seemed pretty upset when neither me nor the other girl from the party picked the busty musketeer lady with doe eyes. Actually, the girl's bf picked her and ended up playing as a socially awkward genius with a lisp ; great character, but not the one the DM had envisioned. I went for Javier, the attractive, flirty spaniard who was kicked out of the army for sleeping with the sergeant's wife ; when asked to describe him, I decided I wanted him to have a wonderful mustache and to be ""perfectly rotund : a wonderful sphere of a man, with facehair that would make Dali weep "". DM gritted teeth at that, and told me ""No, read again : he's attractive."" First big red flag of the evening, but I shrugged it off and insisted. ""He's round and fat and beautiful, with a voice like Pavarotti."" I did theater for some time and proceeded to do a rather hilarious impersonation of an opera barytone with a spanish accent. It's all in good fun, right ? Right. The DM tells me that if I change the character, I have to roll again for charisma. He asked this of nobody else. I roll 6 on a D6, improving Javier's original 5. He frowns. ""Fine. His shape is so unusual that it draws the eye, I guess."" We share side glances with the other players. Yikes, but you know what? We'll make our own fun. The story proceeds, with mysterious disappearances that we must investigate. We get railroaded a lot, with PNJs refusing to talk to us until it's ""the right time"", travelling times being conveniently too long to fit in our planning, and male characters being so stricken by the Busty Lady that they just offer clues. It's a one-shot, so we don't mind ; no time for an open-world exploration. Still, the DM has a list of prepared monologues and detailed dialogues between PNJs ; it's a little over-dramatic to my taste, but hey, the DM should also enjoy himself and it's not too badly-written. The turning point comes when we take a prisoner working for the high dragon kidnapper ; he's tied to a chair in an ""interrogation cell"", where the DM takes an unconfortable time describing the torture instruments at our disposal. ""So, what do you wanna do ?"" I don't like this vibe, and from the looks on the players' faces, nobody does. We've all played in a very cheerful, collaborative way with a lot of jokes ; a live torture scene fits as well as a Requiem in the middle of a party playlist. ""I seduce the prisoner"", I state loudly. The DM laughs. ""Right, like good cop bad cop. You bring him a glass of water‚Ä¶"" ""No"", I cut him. ""I go on full sultry mode. I'm a vision of heaven in this dark cell. I'm posing. Sure, I'll bring him a glass of water, but also I delicately touch his cheek and tell him he has so much to live for."" The DM blanks. ""It's a man"", he says like I'm an absolute idiot. ""You're a man too."" My turn to grit my teeth. My dude, I have seen bards roll to seduce mountain-sized dragons before, but you're gonna be a bitch and bring homophobia to a fantasy world ? Not on my watch. I shrug. ""I never told you how I had apologized to the sergeant for bedding his wife, right ? I romanced him too. So I'm gonna go and romance that prisoner with my 6 charisma."" The DM's eyebrows make knots. ""He won't let you touch him"", he spits. ""He fears you."" Fair enough. ""I serenade him from a distance."" The scene is hilarious ‚Äì four musketeers standing in a Bastille cell while one of them is playing mandoline on his knees ‚Äì I do take the time to compose a short rhyming sonnet about how he should tell us what he knows so we can defeat mankind's foes, and it's better to spend the night with a spaniard joker than an iron-hot poker. ""Fine, roll for it."" Little note on the system : he usually sets a difficulty, and if it's inferior to our stats, we don't even need to roll. Otherwise, we add the dice result. I ask how much is required ‚Äì convincing our boss that accidentally murdering a guard was an honest mistake was only a 6. ""A 300"", he laughs. ""You're a MAN. If SHE wanted to try, though‚Ä¶"" He points at the guy playing Busty Lady, who has already established that she didn't like using her charms. ""I have no idea how to do this"", the player says. ""It's fine, DM replies. For you, it's a 1."" The player refuses. ""She doesn't like to do that. She just stands and claps in rythm to Javier's song."" DM is livid, and takes a second to fold his notes. ""Alright, he begs you to stop singing. I'll tell you anything, he screams, just keep the pervert away from me!"". The vibe switches instantly. The other girl looks at her BF, I look at her, we look at the DM. It's like we silently formed a pact of ""Well, Fuck That"". The adventure is nearing its end ; we find the mansion of the high dragon lady kidnapping nobles for Nefarious Purposes that were never clearly stated. Conveniently, there's a party going on. ""You reckon that if you manage to stealthily mix with the crowd, you might be able to find the kidnapped countess somewhere. The Dragon-Destroying McGuffin is probably here as well, but it would take a while to find it."" Time to shine for Javier. ""I walk to the high dragon lady and ask news of her marriage"", I state. DM is baffled. ""That's not stealthy."" I argue that it's a party, and that enquiring about our hostess is only polite. ""Fine. She icily tells you that her marriage is open as ever since her husband is insufficient, but that you're too fat for her taste. What a shame, she says. If only you had retained the shape you had long ago."" I smile. ""I find your husband perfectly sufficient."" DM and high dragon lady both choke. ""You can't have fucked her husband. It's not possible."" I insist that it is, especially since she just mentioned an open marriage (which is ludicrous in the society he painted, but hey : he brought it up) and I did. I bring up cheeky details that have him fuming before long. He has completely forgotten about the party or the other players, and this goes on for quite some time. Dragon lady calls the guards because I'm being a filthy liar, he has me fight them off, solo. About 20 minutes later, when I have only 1 HP left, Busty Lady politely coughs. ""I hit the dragon on the head with the Dragon Destroyer McGuffin"". ""What ? You don't have that."" ""Yeah, I do. The dragon lady has been busy with Javier for 20 minutes. We've searched the mansion in the meantime."" DM protests that he was gonna come back to them at some point, but the library is closing and everyone is pretty done with this shite. Busty Lady argues that with all the guards clobbering a bisexual musketeer, it wasn't very difficult to move around. We can see the pain in the DM's eyes as his Big Boss Fight slips away from his hands. After a bunch more arguing, and pressed by the library lady to pack up, he surrenders. ""Fine"", he says again glowering. ""But she kills you in a final gesture."" It's a oneshot and I definitely won't play with that guy again, so I roll with it. I improvise a dramatic death monologue as I clutch my chest, but it's the other girl from the party who has the last word. She's been good fun the entire adventure, playing her stern, battle-hardened musketeer with few words and always diving headfirst into combat. ""I kiss him"", she says as we pack and the DM leaves without a word. ""I kiss him on his mouth as he dies, and our mustaches touch, and it is beautiful."" We shared a burst of laughter that lasted until long after we left the library, and we parted ways. I haven't seen her nor her boyfriend again, but I sure hope they're also somewhere having fun and tearing apart stereotypes. &#x200B; by GreenPineapple"	AllThingsDND
Sadness, depression & loneliness is fine. Hate and bitterness is where you should draw the line	This may sound a little counterproductive but let me just explain. If you‚Äôre ugly and generally unsuccessful with the opposite sex (like me) it‚Äôs actually PERFECTLY fine to be sad about that. Lots of people on reddit and subs like this and the dating advice one, tell people in my position to not care, and focus on our lives etc. Well, I disagree. Our bodies, hearts and minds literally force us to fall in love, seek sex and companionship. Unless you‚Äôre a literal psychopath, there‚Äôs no escape! You‚Äôll go to college/work... there will be cute girls/boys in your class/workplace or even just customers. You‚Äôll be attracted. It‚Äôs human nature. And when you‚Äôre generally plain or not anything special, being lonely and not sexually active you‚Äôll get sad and depressed. This doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person and reddit is confusing because it make you feel like a bad person for wanting love, companionships and even just sex - all of which are natural. Me? It‚Äôs almost been a week since I drag myself out of redpill/MGTOW stuff. It‚Äôs been easier than I thought, bad things about women have creeped up on me, but I just thought of examples of girls who AIN‚ÄôT like the bad ones and I was able to get over it. My resentment and bitterness has actually left, however sadness and general depression has stayed. Like - it sucks that not even ONE cute girl has liked me, asked me out or anything you know, when my friends have multiples girls hitting them up, GF‚Äôs, FWBs etc. And I don‚Äôt... it hurts and anyone in my position should feel sad and depressed if you‚Äôre a person with basic human emotions. However, if you let these thoughts an feelings marinate into hate and anger towards women/men, well, then you have a problem. It‚Äôs not right to hate on people for not liking you, they‚Äôre free to do so! I‚Äôm a pretty normal guy. I pulled myself out of that shit and I reconnected with a female friends, I‚Äôm feeling much better but when my friends talks about sex I definitely feel sad and left out. Depression and sadness are fine. Hate and bitterness makes you the creepy, weird incel loser.	exredpill

Enerveration and dmg immunities	If a warlock were to cast and succeed on enerveration (deals 4d8 necrotic and they heal half of that) or a similar spell against a creature with immunity to necrotic dmg, would they still be able to heal half the damage or would it nullify that altogether? im assuming they wouldnt be able to but wanted some other thoughts on it. EDIT: and also kinda related, if they had Resistance, would they heal for the same ammount or half of the half damage it took.	DMAcademy
Inventory Wiped - Can't Interact w/ anything in the world	Everything has been fine in the last week of playing until the last 30 minutes. First of all Realms started lagging (Happens a few times a day yet isn't my internet) and I decided to relog to see if it was my Internet. After doing various speed tests it wasn't an issue on my side. The lag continued so I closed and reopened the realm. I can currently load in after an extreme delay on chunk generation yet my inventory is cleared and I can not open any item such as my chests, brewing stands and furnaces. This is honestly frustrating but what is the actual problem? I'm super close to just cancelling my realms subscription because this has honestly frustrated me.	realms

"Between COVID-19, Archaeology, DXP, Mobile/iOS beta, Mod Warden's promises (which are actually coming true) and VERY successful Ninja updates, we might be in a resurgence for RS3.

Can we hear what the company plans to do to address the poor performance of the servers so they can handle a better load of players?

Jumper T16 range	Hi all, At the field I've been flying, my Spektrum Racing Drone sat (SPM4649T) lost signal so the quad came down (Using my trusty DX8) and I decided to replace the gear with a Jumper T16 tx and a Jumper R1+ RX. Now I still get a 'low RSSI' warning (Set to 52dB) at about 120m (\~400 feet) away and 10 m (\~30 feet) altitude. What range are you getting with the Jumper T16?

What are some debunked theories that you're glad were wrong?	To me, the theory that the Yonko had no bounties always made absolutely no sense at all. The only idea behind it was that the Yonko were too strong for any bounty hunters to defeat them, but that just doesn't logically follow with how the World Government operates. First of all, that's basically an admission that these people are too powerful for the World Government to defeat, and that they're more or less above the law. This completely doesn't vibe with the sense of absolute control over the world that the WG likes to front. Secondly, these people weren't *born* Yonko, they *became* Yonko. Meaning they had long careers of piracy before reaching the status, and would have accumulated a bounty. Would the world government just rescind someone's bounty because they feel like nobody can handle them? Or would they put a big price on their heads in the hopes that someone incredibly strong, or maybe a group of incredibly strong people, would go out and bring them in? The whole theory was just completely illogical, and it was a good day when the chapter came out that revealed Blackbeard's bounty. How about you guys? Any theories that you are glad didn't come true?

Wife has boyfriend, contacted lawyer.	My wife has taken advantage of me for the last time, today I contacted a lawyer. She is a taker, never a giver and I have nothing more to give. My giving well is empty after she always drew from it but never replenished the reservoir. A giant weight has been lifted, I'm 40 with a 17 year old son who will be a senior this year. I'm hold fast for the next six months, I want to see if the housing market tanks so I can keep the home, and finish raising my son in it. Only 60K in equity, I need the market to correct 25% so my mortgage will be underwater when I file. I have a good rate, screw selling the home and it's in my name. We have 5 acers of land in the hills, worth about 60K, but the well doesn't work, so I think I can get it down to 45K in worth, which equals out debt. I want to keep the house, keep my land, keep the debt, and she can go draw from her bum of a boyfriend's well. Have fun you toxic POS, the war has begun!	Divorce
Threatening Jury Votes Strategy	"This is a strategy I've wondered about while rewatching RI and other seasons and I don't know of it's even allowed. After the merge in RI, Ometepe is up 7-5 and vote out one of their own. Now 6-5, Zapatera works like crazy to try and get one of them to open up their eyes and see that they are brainwashed robots. Alas, they don't and the get Pagonged. My idea for a strategy is this: After the first Zapatera member gets picked off and the numbers are 6-4, they see the writing on the wall and are pretty much sitting ducks. They know Rob is completely in control and brainwashed his fellow 5 Ometepe members. What if they go up to Rob and say, ""We know you're in control, if you don't take put a few Ometepe people before you tale all of us out, the 4 of us will vote against you at FTC."" Let's just say it's not a bluff and they will follow through with it. That would force Rob to do something, because if someone is definitely getting 4 votes at FTC, then all they need is 1 more and hes screwed. I've only seem s1-22 and s38-40. Has this strategy ever been used or thought of? Is it allowed? What are your thoughts?"	survivor

In your personal opinion, what is the least useful perk card?	I haven‚Äôt looked through every perk card with this question in mind, but just off the top of my head Hydro Fix seems like one of the least useful cards. It reduces thirst from chems, which is such a minor thing imo. I always have dozens of purified water on hand, and I only have 3 small purifiers. I don‚Äôt use chems often though, so maybe it‚Äôs more useful than I make it out to be. The card that increases caps from cap stashes also seems pretty useless. Like yeah, extra caps are good, but I very rarely actually find a stash while just exploring.	fo76

CAN KONAMI RECLAIMING THE THRONE WITH PES 2021?!	well as we all know guys there are lot of problems with pes 20 mobile and console too, according to me the 3 main problems are:- 1. THE REFREES- as we all know and have experienced when we commit a foul even if it is a shoulder puch but too hard, or a tacke the refree will always blow the whistle for a foul but when AI does it its like the refree was talking to someone and didn't even notice, fouls are not given away especially in the penalty box, wether the keeper comes and commit a late challenge or dive to early to trip the player rather than collecting the ball, freekicks and penalities are rarely given away if any player wants to improve the gamplay it's not possible as the refrees are totally upto the coding in which the user don't plays any part. 2. THE RESPONSIVENESS- the resposnse of player when we go for a banger or a rocket and it hits the defender and gets deflected is very poor as the player still needs to press and run to collect the ball but i noticed it stops for 1 or 2 seconds and goes in the opposite direction or don't even move when shot is deflected. 3. PASSING- passing has been getting poor everytime short passes are looking like through passes and player just stops for a second and the ball is out of play you play a simple short pass when trying to build up the player will pass it to hard that the other player can't even get to the ball, same with through passing, as the best way to win in superstar is to play short passes and create spaces, the passing seems to lack in some areas which also can result in scripting or a part of scripting, still it does not happen very often except the other two problems. THINGS THAT MAKE PES BETTER: 1. THE BALL PHYSICS- as pes has improved the ball physics a lot and that is why we can experience more real life gameplay as the passing plays an impotant role in winning the game and in the build-up PES has given us a slow pacy gameplay like real life pass and move, pass and move create spaces like gameplay which is really good. THINGS TO IMPROVE: 1. THE LICENCES- the main thing realism PES has delivered really well over the past years, yes there are still flaws but they've improved in there gameplay according to me, but the main thing that makes FIFA better than pes is licences pes needs so many top teams licence, liverpool, madrid, chelsea, dortmund, athletico, manchester city, mostly premier leagues whereas FIFA only lacks in juventus license and PES has started gaining licence and are now focusing on that by buying the bayern, juventus and manchester united one so hopefully they can buy more and they will. THESE POINTS AND REVIEWS ARE MY EXPERIENCE AND ALSO SOME PEOPLE ALSO COMPLAINED AND APPRECIATED THIS ON THIS SUB-REDDIT SO I THOUGHT IT'S BETTER TO TELL WHAT ARE THE 'ADVANTAGES' AND 'DISADVANTAGES' AND OF COURSE EVERY GAME HAS MANY FLAWS AND PLUS POINTS. IT'S BETTER TO DISCUSS THESE OR ANY TYPE OF ISSUES IN THE GAME LIKE THIS WITHOUT RANTING OR ABUSING THE DEVELOPERS WHICH EVERYONE WILL FIND APPROPRIATE AND WE CAN FIND THE SOLUTIONS ALSO, SO I REQUEST DON'T ABUSE OR RANT. THANK YOU SOO MUCH FOR READING THIS AND FOR YOUR TIME, STAY SAFE, HAVE A NICE DAY :)	pesmobile

[S3E5] Question about Villanelle's mom	"I just rewatched the scene where Villanelle's mom first comes home, she sees V and says ""my baby is alive!"" and goes to hug her while crying. But I noticed that while she's making the right expressions and sounds, not a single tear falls. The crying doesn't seem genuine. In fact, it seems like beforehand, when she first sees V, she's calculating her next move and how she wants to play things. I don't think she was ever for a second happy to see V, which aligns with their last scene together when she asks V to leave. I was thinking this especially about the final scene between V and her mom. Is her mom a psychopath? I know we didn't get much exposure to the character of her mom, but her mom seems more psychopathic than V, in my opinion."	KillingEve

Rules question: When deep striking or using concealed positions do you only measure horizontal distance or also vertical?	"Here's the situation: I was playing a friendly game with a buddy who is new. He was deep striking some inceptors and asked if he could set them up on top of a building that was within a few inches of my troops horizontally, but was more than 9"" away when you take vertical distance into account. I told him he couldn't and he was cool with it but now I'm not sure if I'm right or where I can find clarification. Also I can tell him that I goofed if I was wrong. So TL:DR; when doing deep striking, concealed positions, or other abilities that require you to be more than 9"" away is it purely horizontal or can they go onto a building? I seem to remember reading that you couldn't during a discussion of the FLY keyword since it ignores vertical distance when charging but I'm not sure. I also should really figure this out since I'm building a jump pack heavy Blood Angels list."	Warhammer40k
