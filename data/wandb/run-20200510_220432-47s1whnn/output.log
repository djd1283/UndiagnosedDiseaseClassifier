I dont want adhd, ive failed at every adult milestone (except my marriage) because of it. Being unmedicated and undiagnosed can lead to so much internalized shame. I dont know how long it will take to unravel that ball of shame. :(
I have a feeling I'm undiagnosed ADHD. I know there's something wrong with me that I've suffered for all my life. I'm probably on the spectrum as well. Instead of getting helped, I got punished. (I'm sure you know this exactly, being a year younger than I am).
